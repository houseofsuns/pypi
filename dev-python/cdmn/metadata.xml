	<longdescription># cDMN## Welcome to the cDMN solver's code repository.cDMN stands for Constraint Decision and Model Notation.It is an extension to the [DMN](https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/About-DMN/) standard, managed by the Object Management Group (OMG).cDMN combines the readability and straighforwardness of DMN and the expressiveness and flexibility of constraint reasoning.For more specific details, please visit our [cDMN documentation](https://cdmn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notation.html).## ExamplesExample implementations can also be found in the [cDMN documentation](https://cdmn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html).## Installation and usageThe full installation and usage guide for the cDMN solver can be found [here](https://cdmn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/solver.html).In short for Linux: after cloning this repo, install the Python dependencies.```git clone https://gitlab.com/EAVISE/cdmn/cdmn-solvercd cdmn-solverpip3 install -r requirements.txt```After this, you can run the solver. Example usage is as follows:```python3 -O solver.py Name_Of_XLSX.xlsx -n &quot;Name_Of_Sheet&quot; -o output_name.idp```## ReferenceIf you used cDMN in a publication or in other works, reference us as follows:BibTeX:```@article{cDMN,  title = {Tackling the {{DM}} Challenges with {{cDMN}}: {{A}} Tight Integration of {{DMN}} and Constraint Reasoning},  author = {Vandevelde, Simon and Aerts, Bram and Vennekens, Joost},  year = {2021},  journal = {Theory and Practice of Logic Programming},  pages = {1--24},  publisher = {{Cambridge University Press}},  doi = {10.1017/S1471068421000491}}```or direct cite:```Vandevelde, S., Aerts, B., &amp; Vennekens, J.

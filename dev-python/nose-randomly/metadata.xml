If you want to continuemaintenance please contact me.----Nose plugin to randomly order tests and control ``random.seed``. (Alsoavailable `for pytest &lt;https://github.com/adamchainz/pytest-randomly&gt;`_).Features--------All of these features are on by default but can be disabled with flags.* Randomly shuffles the submodules, ``TestCase`` classes + test functions when  loading a module of tests.* Randomly shuffles the test functions inside a ``TestCase`` when loading it.* Resets ``random.seed()`` at the start of every test case and test to a fixed  number - this defaults to ``time.time()`` from the start of your test run,  but you can pass in ``--randomly-seed`` to repeat a randomness-induced  failure.* If  `factory boy &lt;https://factoryboy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html&gt;`_  is installed, its random state is reset at the start of every test. This  allows for repeatable use of its random 'fuzzy' features.* If `faker &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fake-factory&gt;`_ is installed, its  random state is reset at the start of every test. This is also for repeatable  fuzzy data in tests - factory boy uses faker for lots of data.About-----Randomness in testing can be quite powerful to discover hidden flaws in thetests themselves, as well as giving a little more coverage to your system.By randomly ordering the tests, the risk of surprising inter-test dependenciesis reduced - a technique used in many places, for example Google's C++ testrunner `googletest&lt;https://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/V1_5_AdvancedGuide#Shuffling_the_Tests&gt;`_.By resetting the random seed to a repeatable number for each test, tests cancreate data based on random numbers and yet remain repeatable, for examplefactory boy's fuzzy values. This is good for ensuring that tests specify thedata they need and that the tested system is not affected by any data that isfilled in randomly due to not being specified.Requirements------------Tested with:* Python 2.7, 3.6* The latest version of NoseUsage-----Install from pip with:.. code-block:: bash    pip install nose-randomlyNose will automatically find the plugin.To activate it on your test run, use the ``--with-randomly`` flag, for example:.. code-block:: bash    nosetests -v --with-randomlyThe output will start with an extra line that tells you the random seed that isbeing used:.. code-block:: bash    Using --randomly-seed=1234    test_D (abcd_tests.Tests) ... ok    ...If the tests then fail due to ordering or randomly created data, you can thenrestart them with that seed:.. code-block:: bash    nosetests -v --with-randomly --randomly-seed=1234You can disable behaviours you don't like with the following flags:* ``--randomly-dont-shuffle-modules`` - turn off the shuffling of the contents  of modules* ``--randomly-dont-shuffle-cases`` - turn off the shuffling of test functions  inside ``TestCase`` classes* ``--randomly-dont-reset-seed`` - turn off the reset of ``random.seed()`` at  the start of every testBackground----------`nose` has an `unmerged pull request&lt;https://code.google.com/p/python-nose/issues/detail?id=255&gt;`_ from 2009 to addrandom ordering functionality. This is available in plugin format in the`nose-randomize &lt;https://github.com/nloadholtes/nose-randomize/&gt;`_ package. Itworks quite well but I found that since it replaces all of the test loadingmachinery inside `nose`, it can interact badly with other plugins. This pluginwas developed as a thinner layer to achieve the same thing, plus the randomseed resetting which was not available before.License-------* BSD licensed, see LICENSE file* Logo by Christian Mohr from the Noun Project  (`link &lt;https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=dice&amp;i=110905&gt;`_).History-------Pending release---------------1.2.6 (2019-02-07)------------------* Update PyPI development status as inactive. This package is no longer  maintained, see README.rst.* Dropped Python 2.6 compatibility, as upstream dependency NumPy did.1.2.5 (2016-10-28)------------------* Set a high plugin score to ensure that ``nose-randomly`` is loaded before  other plugins. This fixes a bug where randomization would disapper when using  the ``doctests`` plugin that is included with Nose.1.2.4 (2016-10-27)------------------* Reset the random state for NumPy too.1.2.3 (2016-08-19)------------------* Fixed output so the random seed is always output when the plugin is enabled,  not just when resetting ``random.seed()`` at the start of tests. Thanks  @amygdalama.1.2.2 (2016-07-06)------------------* Fixed to work with ``python setup.py nosetests`` on Python 2 due to issue  with ``unicode`` not working with ``distutils.fancy_getopt``.1.2.1 (2016-06-01)------------------* Support test generators.1.2.0 (2015-12-10)------------------* Reset the random state for Faker (pip package ``fake-factory``) too1.1.0 (2015-08-27)------------------* Reset the random seed at the start of nose test contexts (TestCases  etc.) too* Slight performance improvement by always using ``random.setstate()`` for  reseeding1.0.0 (2015-07-23)------------------* First release on PyPI.</longdescription>

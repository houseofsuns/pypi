Visualizationsare available as 1D histograms, 2D scatterplots and 3D scatterplots.* **Access &amp; manipulate learned parameters.** With complete access to the internalsof the model, set or tune parameters to your choosing.# InstallInstall the Copulas library using pip or conda.```bashpip install copulas``````bashconda install -c conda-forge copulas```# UsageGet started using a demo dataset. This dataset contains 3 numerical columns.```pythonfrom copulas.datasets import sample_trivariate_xyzreal_data = sample_trivariate_xyz()real_data.head()```&lt;img src=&quot;docs/images/copulas_sample_dataset.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;&gt;Model the data using a copula and use it to create synthetic data.The Copulas library offers many options including Gaussian Copula,Vine Copulas and Archimedian Copulas.```pythonfrom copulas.multivariate import GaussianMultivariatecopula = GaussianMultivariate()copula.fit(real_data)synthetic_data = copula.sample(len(real_data))```Visualize the real and synthetic data side-by-side. Let's do this in 3D so see our full dataset.```pythonfrom copulas.visualization import compare_3dcompare_3d(real_data, synthetic_data)```![Quickstart](docs/images/quickstart.png)# TutorialsClick below to run the code yourself on a Colab Notebook and discover new features.[![Tutorial Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tutorial-Colab-F9AB00?style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=googlecolab&amp;color=525252)](https://bit.ly/copulas-demo)# Community &amp; SupportLearn more about Copulas library from our [documentation](https://sdv.dev/Copulas/) site.**Questions or issues?** Join our [Slack channel](https://bit.ly/sdv-slack-invite)to discuss more about Copulas and synthetic data.If you find a bug or have a feature request, you can also[open an issue](https://github.com/sdv-dev/Copulas/issues/new/choose) on our GitHub.**Interested in contributing to Copulas?** Read our[Contribution Guide](https://sdv.dev/Copulas/contributing.html) to get started.# CreditsThe Copulas open source project first started at the Data to AI Lab at MIT in 2018.Thank you to our team of contributors who have built and maintained the library over the years![View Contributors](https://github.com/sdv-dev/Copulas/graphs/contributors)---&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://datacebo.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;center&quot; width=40% src=&quot;https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/blob/master/docs/images/DataCebo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[The Synthetic Data Vault Project](https://sdv.dev) was first created at MIT's [Data to AI Lab](https://dai.lids.mit.edu/) in 2016. After 4 years of research and traction with enterprise, wecreated [DataCebo](https://datacebo.com) in 2020 with the goal of growing the project.Today, DataCebo is the proud developer of SDV, the largest ecosystem forsynthetic data generation &amp; evaluation. It is home to multiple libraries that support syntheticdata, including:* 🔄 Data discovery &amp; transformation. Reverse the transforms to reproduce realistic data.* 🧠 Multiple machine learning models -- ranging from Copulas to Deep Learning -- to create tabular,  multi table and time series data.* 📊 Measuring quality and privacy of synthetic data, and comparing different synthetic data  generation models.[Get started using the SDV package](https://sdv.dev/SDV/getting_started/install.html) -- a fullyintegrated solution and your one-stop shop for synthetic data.

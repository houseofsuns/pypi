PK is used to ensure that there is sufficient concentration of the drug to maintain the required efficacy of the drug, while ensuring that the concentration levels remain below the toxic threshold. For an introductory theory, we recommend &quot;Principles of Pharmacokinetics&quot;, by Ratain et. al. Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK12815/The model presented discretises the body into several linked, homogeneous compartments through which the concentration of an administered drug is tracked. It allows the user to specify the drug administration protocol, as well as physiological parameters.## DemoThe program outputs a figure and the associated data. With these users may compare models with different protocols and physiological parameters. An example is provided in the results directory, as shown in the following figure.&lt;img src=results/Example_Figure.png width=&quot;700&quot;&gt;## ContributingPull requests are welcome.

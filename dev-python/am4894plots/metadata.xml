I got fed up spending half a day or more each time i wanted to do some new plots or charts in python.I never really settled on any single plotting package and refuse to learn matplotlib!So instead anytime i have a new type of plot i need to do that could be useful again to me in future, i'm going to pick whatever plotting lib does it best/easiest for me, try generalise it a bit and add it as functionality into this package.This was also a good excuse for me to learn a bit about developing python packages and pushing them to pypi.Use at you own peril!

	<longdescription>pysolbase============Welcome to pysolCopyright (C) 2013/2017 Laurent Labatut / Laurent Champagnacpysolbase is a set of python helpers to ease development.It is gevent (co-routines) based.Usage===============Engage gevent monkey patching and setup default logger configuration:`SolBase.voodoo_init()`Initialize logging system (without engaging gevent) with default configuration (ie console logs - there is support for syslog and file logs).`SolBase.logging_init(&quot;INFO&quot;)`Re-initialize logging system (without engaging gevent):`SolBase.logging_init(&quot;DEBUG&quot;, True)`Millis helpers:```ms = SolBase.mscurrent()do_something()ms_elapsed = SolBase.msdiff(ms)```Date helpers```dt = SolBase.datecurrent()do_something()ms_elapsed = SolBase.datediff(dt)```Binary helpers```bin_buf = SolBase.unicode_to_binary('This is my text buffer', encoding='utf-8')unicode_string = SolBase.binary_to_unicode(bin_buf, encoding='utf-8')```File helpers```FileUtility.append_text_to_file('/tmp/test.txt', 'This is my text buffer', 'utf-8')bin_buf = FileUtility.file_to_binary('/tmp/test.txt')unicode_string = FileUtility.file_to_text('/tmp/test.txt', 'utf-8')```Exception helper```try:   a = None   b = a + 1except Exception as e:   logger.warn(&quot;Ex=%s&quot;, SolBase.extostr(e))```Source code===============- We are pep8 compliant (as far as we can, with some exemptions)- We use a right margin of 360 characters (please don't talk me about 80 chars)- All unittest files must begin with `test_` or `Test`, should implement setUp and tearDown methods- All tests must adapt to any running directory- The whole project is backed by gevent (http://www.gevent.org/)- We use docstring (:return, :rtype, :param, :type etc), they are mandatory- We use PyCharm &quot;noinspection&quot;, feel free to use themRequirements===============- Debian 10 or greater, x64, Python 3.7Unittests===============To run unittests, you will need:- nothing special except Python and dependencies requirements.License===============This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/ormodify it under the terms of the GNU General Public Licenseas published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2of the License, or (at your option) any later version.This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty ofMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

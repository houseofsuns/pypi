	<longdescription># **C**redito **E**miliano -  Fe**ature **S**election, **T**ransformation and **E**limination (CE - FeSTE)This repo contains the 'FeSTE' python package which helps in the features management from the pre-filtering to the pre-processing and feature elimination.# InstallationTo install it:1) **Optional**: create a new Python virtual environment (through bash terminal run: &quot;py -m venv your_env_name&quot; and then &quot;source your_env_name/Scripts/activate )2) Install the package:    - User Mode: ```pip install ce-feste```# StructureThe .py package is stored in src and contains 3 sub-modules:- **selection**: contains the feature preliminary selection functions- **transform**: contains the feature pre-processing functions- **elimination**: contains the feature elimination functions# Filters## Selection- Univariate filters:    - No constant features    - Number of distinct value too low    - Number of missing values too high    - Too concentrate in the most frequent value    - Unstable between sets- Multivariate filters:    - Spearman Correlation for numerical features    - Cramer's V for categorical features    - R2 for mixed features    - VIF- Explanatory filters:    - Feature AUROC for classification     - Feature Correlation with target for regression    ## Elimination- Shap Recursive Feature Elimination with HyperParam Optimization# Trasformation- Only 2 classes added to select and rename columns in datasets. Useful for generating the production pipeline</longdescription>

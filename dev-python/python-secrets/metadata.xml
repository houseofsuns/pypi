Reduces security risks from things like weak default passwords,secrets stored in files in the source code repository directory.Version: 23.4.2* Free software: `Apache 2.0 License &lt;https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0&gt;`_* Documentation: https://python_secrets.readthedocs.org.Features--------* Uses the `openstack/cliff`_ command line framework for a robust and  full-featured CLI. It is easy to add new commands and features!* Supports a &quot;drop-in&quot; model for defining variables in a modular manner  (something like the `python-update-dotdee`_ program), supporting simplified  bulk setting or generating values of variables as needed.* Like `python-update-dotdee`_, `psec` produces a single master  ``.json`` file to hold variables defined by the drop-in group  description files. That means you can use that file directly  to set variables to be used from within other programs like  Ansible (e.g.  ``ansible-playbook playbook.yml -e @&quot;$(psec secrets path)&quot;``)* Support multiple simultaneous sets of secrets (environments) for  flexibility and scalability in multi-environment deployments and to  support different use cases or different combinations of secrets.* Supports changing the storage location of secrets and variables to  allow them to be stored on secure mobile media (such as self-encrypting  external SSD or Flash drives) or encrypted disk images mounted at  run-time to ensure the confidentiality of data at rest.* List the groups of variables (and how many secrets in each group).* Describe secrets by their variable name and type (e.g., ``password``,  ``uuid4``, ``random_base64``). You can also include a descriptive  string to prompt the user for a value, a list of options to choose  from (or ``*`` for &quot;any value the user enters&quot;), and a list of  environment variables to export for other programs to use at  run time.* Allows manual entry of values, setting non-secret variables from  a default value, or automatic generation of secrets according to  their type.* Manually set ``string`` variables based on the output of simple  commands. This allows interfacing with external programs for  obtaining secrets, such as `Vault by Hashicorp`_.* Generate unique values for variables, or use a single value per  type to simplify use of secrets in access control of services  while supporting a &quot;break-glass&quot; process to quickly regenerate  secrets when needed.* Show the variables and their unredacted values (or redacted them  to maintain secrecy during demonstrations or in documentation).* Export the variables (optionally with a specific prefix string)  to the environment and run a command that inherits them (e.g.,  to pass variables to `terraform`_ for provisioning cloud  instances).* Output the variables and values in multiple different formats (CSV,  JSON, YAML) for use in shell scripts, etc. using ``cliff`` features.* Send secrets to other users on demand using GPG encrypted email to  protect the secrets while in transit and while at rest in users'  email inboxes.* Makes it easy to store temporary files (e.g., the output from  Jinja template rendering)  that may contain secrets *outside* of the source repo directory  in an environment-specific ``tmp/`` directory... note::   Due to the use of the Python ``secrets`` module, which was introduced   in Python 3.6, only Python versions &gt;= 3.6 can be used..... _limitations:Limitations-----------* Secrets are stored in *unencrypted* form in the environments  directories.  Permissions are set to limit access, but this is not an  &quot;encrypt data at rest&quot; solution like `Vault by Hashicorp`_.* Does not handle secure distributed access for users on remote systems. You  must use something like `Vault by Hashicorp`_ or `libfuse/sshfs`_ for secure  (realtime) distributed access.* Does not handle secure distribution of newly generated secrets out  to distributed systems that need them. You will need to use a program  like `Ansible`_ and related playbooks for pushing out and changing  secrets (or for retrieving backups). Look at the `D2 Ansible  playbooks`_ (https://github.com/davedittrich/ansible-dims-playbooks)  for example playbooks for doing these tasks.* Does not clean up the environment-specific ``tmp/`` directories.  (You need to handle that in code, but at least they are less likely  to end up in a Git commit.)Usage Concepts--------------There is a separate **Usage** chapter with individual command documentation.The remainder of this section covers higher level usage concepts necessary tobest use the ``python_secrets`` package in your open source software project.Directories and files~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~There are three file system concepts that are important to understandregarding secrets storage:#. The root *secrets base directory* for secrets storage;#. The *environment* for organizing a set of secrets and   secret group descriptions;#. The *secrets* file and *group descriptions*... image:: https://asciinema.org/a/201503.png   :target: https://asciinema.org/a/201503?autoplay=1   :align: center   :alt: Environments   :width: 835px..Secrets Base Directory^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^``psec`` expects to store all of files in a directory tree known as a*secrets base directory*. Originally, this was intended to be located in thecurrent user's home directory. Unless you over-ride the name of this directory,it defaults to ``.secrets`` on Linux and ``secrets`` on Windows.The ability to locate this directory in a different file system path issupported by command line options and an environment variable so you can storefiles on an exported file share, in a common location for use by a group on aworkstation, or to move the contents to an encrypted disk or a differentpartition with more disk space.The first time you use ever use ``psec``, there will likely be nodirectory:.. code-block:: console    $ tree ~/.secrets    /Users/dittrich/.secrets [error opening dir]    0 directories, 0 files.... note::   The secrets base directory may be created automatically for you the   first time you create an environment.  For more information, see   ``psec init --help``...Environments^^^^^^^^^^^^Environments are sub-directories within the root secrets directory.  You canjust create the directory structure without any files. You createone environment per set of unique secrets that you need to manage. This couldbe one for open source *Program A*, one for *Program B*, etc., or it could beone for *development*, one for *testing*, one for *production*, etc. (or anycombination)... image:: https://asciinema.org/a/201505.png   :target: https://asciinema.org/a/201505?autoplay=1   :align: center   :alt: Groups, secrets, generating and setting   :width: 835px..The command ``environments create`` creates an environment.  Since thisprogram is designed to support multiple environments, a name for the newenvironment is required.  The name of the environment can be providedexplicitly, or it can be inferred from the base name of the current workingdirectory:.. code-block:: console    $ pwd    /Users/dittrich/git/python_secrets    $ psec environments create    environment directory /Users/dittrich/.secrets/python_secrets created    $ tree ~/.secrets    /Users/dittrich/.secrets    └── python_secrets        └── secrets.d    2 directories, 0 files..Let's say we want to create empty environments for the three deployments(*development*, *testing*, and *production*). The names can be assignedexplicitly by (a) giving an argument on the command line, (b) using the ``-e`` or``--environment`` command line flag, or (c) by setting the environment variable``D2_ENVIRONMENT``:.. code-block:: console    $ psec environments create development    environment directory /Users/dittrich/.secrets/development created    $ psec --environment testing environments create    environment directory /Users/dittrich/.secrets/testing created    $ D2_ENVIRONMENT=production psec environments create    environment directory /Users/dittrich/.secrets/production created    $ tree ~/.secrets    /Users/dittrich/.secrets    ├── development    │   └── secrets.d    ├── production    │   └── secrets.d    ├── python_secrets    │   └── secrets.d    └── testing        └── secrets.d    8 directories, 0 files..If you want to create more than one environment at once, you willhave to specify all of the names on the command line as arguments:.. code-block:: console    $ psec environments create development testing production    environment directory /Users/dittrich/.secrets/development created    environment directory /Users/dittrich/.secrets/testing created    environment directory /Users/dittrich/.secrets/production created..If you are using one source repository for building multiple deployments, ofcourse you can't rely on the basename of the directory for all deployments. Thedefault environment can be set, shown, or unset, using the ``environmentsdefault`` command... code-block:: console    $ psec environments default --help    usage: psec environments default [-h] [--unset-default] [environment]    Manage default environment via file in cwd    positional arguments:      environment    optional arguments:      -h, --help       show this help message and exit      --unset-default  Unset localized environment default..If no default is explicitly set, the default that would beapplied is returned:.. code-block:: console    $ cd ~/git/python_secrets    $ psec environments default    default environment is &quot;python_secrets&quot;..You can get a list of all available environments at any time,including which one would be the default used by sub-commands:.. code-block:: console    $ psec environments list    +-------------+---------+    | Environment | Default |    +-------------+---------+    | development | No      |    | testing     | No      |    | production  | No      |    +-------------+---------+..The following shows setting and unsetting the default:.. code-block:: console    $ psec environments default testing    default environment set to &quot;testing&quot;    $ psec environments default    testing    $ psec environments list    +-------------+---------+    | Environment | Default |    +-------------+---------+    | development | No      |    | testing     | Yes     |    | production  | No      |    +-------------+---------+    $ psec environments default --unset-default    default environment unset..The environment directories are useable for storing *all* secrets andsensitive files (e.g., backups of certificates, databases, etc.) associatedwith an environment.For convenience, there is a command ``environments tree`` that producesoutput similar to the Unix ``tree`` command:.. code-block:: console    $ psec -e d2 environments tree    /Users/dittrich/.secrets/d2    ├── backups    │   ├── black.secretsmgmt.tk    │   │   ├── letsencrypt_2018-04-06T23:36:58PDT.tgz    │   │   └── letsencrypt_2018-04-25T16:32:20PDT.tgz    │   ├── green.secretsmgmt.tk    │   │   ├── letsencrypt_2018-04-06T23:45:49PDT.tgz    │   │   └── letsencrypt_2018-04-25T16:32:20PDT.tgz    │   ├── purple.secretsmgmt.tk    │   │   ├── letsencrypt_2018-04-25T16:32:20PDT.tgz    │   │   ├── trident_2018-01-31T23:38:48PST.tar.bz2    │   │   └── trident_2018-02-04T20:05:33PST.tar.bz2    │   └── red.secretsmgmt.tk    │       ├── letsencrypt_2018-04-06T23:45:49PDT.tgz    │       └── letsencrypt_2018-04-25T16:32:20PDT.tgz    ├── dittrich.asc    ├── keys    │   └── opendkim    │       └── secretsmgmt.tk    │           ├── 201801.private    │           ├── 201801.txt    │           ├── 201802.private    │           └── 201802.txt    ├── secrets.d    │   ├── ca.json    │   ├── consul.json    │   ├── jenkins.json    │   ├── rabbitmq.json    │   ├── trident.json    │   ├── vncserver.json    │   └── zookeper.json    ├── secrets.json    └── vault_password.txt..To just see the directory structure and not files, add the ``--no-files`` option:.. code-block:: console    $ psec -e d2 environments tree --no-files    /Users/dittrich/.secrets/d2    ├── backups    │   ├── black.secretsmgmt.tk    │   ├── green.secretsmgmt.tk    │   ├── purple.secretsmgmt.tk    │   └── red.secretsmgmt.tk    ├── keys    │   └── opendkim    │       └── secretsmgmt.tk    └── secrets.d..Secrets and group descriptions^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The environment directories just created are all empty. Secrets are stored in aJSON file (``.json``) within the environment's directory, and group descriptionsare stored in a drop-in directory with the same base name, but with anextention of ``.d`` instead of ``.json`` (following the Linux drop-inconfiguration style directories used by programs like ``rsyslog``, ``dnsmasq``,etc.)The default secrets file name is ``secrets.json``, which means the defaultdescriptions directory would be named ``secrets.d``.You can define environment variables to point to the secrets base directoryin which a set of different environments can be configured at onetime, to define the current environment, and to change the nameof the secrets file to something else... code-block:: console    $ env | grep ^D2_    D2_SECRETS_BASEDIR=/Users/dittrich/.secrets    D2_ENVIRONMENT=do..Each environment is in turn rooted in a directory with the environment'ssymbolic name (e.g., ``do`` for DigitalOcean in this example, and ``goSecure``for the GitHub `davedittrich/goSecure`_ VPN project.).. code-block:: console    $ tree -L 1 ~/.secrets    /Users/dittrich/.secrets    ├── do    └── goSecure    3 directories, 0 files..Each set of secrets for a given service or purpose is described in its ownfile... code-block:: console    .    ├── secrets.d    │   ├── ca.json    │   ├── consul.json    │   ├── jenkins.json    │   ├── rabbitmq.json    │   ├── trident.json    │   ├── vncserver.json    │   └── zookeper.json    └── secrets.json..You can see one of the descriptions files from the templatein this repository using ``cat tests/secrets.d/myapp.json``:.. code-block:: json    [      {        &quot;Variable&quot;: &quot;myapp_pi_password&quot;,        &quot;Type&quot;: &quot;password&quot;,        &quot;Prompt&quot;: &quot;Password for myapp 'pi' user account&quot;,        &quot;Export&quot;: &quot;DEMO_pi_password&quot;      },      {        &quot;Variable&quot;: &quot;myapp_app_password&quot;,        &quot;Type&quot;: &quot;password&quot;,        &quot;Prompt&quot;: &quot;Password for myapp web app&quot;,        &quot;Export&quot;: &quot;DEMO_app_password&quot;      },      {        &quot;Variable&quot;: &quot;myapp_client_psk&quot;,        &quot;Type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;,        &quot;Prompt&quot;: &quot;Pre-shared key for myapp client WiFi AP&quot;,        &quot;Options&quot;: &quot;*&quot;,        &quot;Export&quot;: &quot;DEMO_client_psk&quot;      },      {        &quot;Variable&quot;: &quot;myapp_client_ssid&quot;,        &quot;Type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;,        &quot;Prompt&quot;: &quot;SSID for myapp client WiFi AP&quot;,        &quot;Options&quot;: &quot;myapp_ssid,*&quot;,        &quot;Export&quot;: &quot;DEMO_client_ssid&quot;      },      {        &quot;Variable&quot;: &quot;myapp_ondemand_wifi&quot;,        &quot;Type&quot;: &quot;boolean&quot;,        &quot;Prompt&quot;: &quot;'Connect on demand' when connected to wifi&quot;,        &quot;Options&quot;: &quot;true,false&quot;,        &quot;Export&quot;: &quot;DEMO_ondemand_wifi&quot;      },      {        &quot;Variable&quot;: &quot;myapp_optional_setting&quot;,        &quot;Type&quot;: &quot;boolean&quot;,        &quot;Prompt&quot;: &quot;Optionally do something&quot;,        &quot;Options&quot;: &quot;false,true&quot;,        &quot;Export&quot;: &quot;DEMO_options_setting&quot;      }    ]..The ``psec`` program uses the `openstack/cliff`_ command lineinterface framework, which supports multiple output formats. The defaultformat the ``table`` format, which makes for nice clean output. (Otherformats will be described later.)The groups can be listed using the ``groups list`` command:.. code-block:: console    $ psec groups list    +---------+-------+    | Group   | Items |    +---------+-------+    | jenkins |     1 |    | myapp   |     4 |    | trident |     2 |    +---------+-------+..The variables in one or more groups can be shown withthe ``groups show`` command:.. code-block:: console    $ psec groups show trident myapp    +---------+-----------------------+    | Group   | Variable              |    +---------+-----------------------+    | trident | trident_sysadmin_pass |    | trident | trident_db_pass       |    | myapp   | myapp_app_password    |    | myapp   | myapp_client_psk      |    | myapp   | myapp_client_ssid     |    | myapp   | myapp_ondemand_wifi   |    | myapp   | myapp_pi_password     |    +---------+-----------------------+..When integrating a new open source tool or project, you can createa new group and clone its secrets descriptions. This does not copyany values, just the descriptions, allowing the current environmentto manage its own values... code-block:: console    $ psec groups create newgroup --clone-from ~/git/goSecure/secrets/secrets.d/gosecure.json    created new group &quot;newgroup&quot;    $ psec groups list 2&gt;/dev/null    +----------+-------+    | Group    | Items |    +----------+-------+    | jenkins  |     1 |    | myapp    |     5 |    | newgroup |    12 |    | trident  |     2 |    +----------+-------+..Showing Secrets~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~To examine the secrets, use the ``secrets show`` command:.. code-block:: console    $ psec secrets show    +------------------------+----------+----------+------------------------+    | Variable               | Type     | Value    | Export                 |    +------------------------+----------+----------+------------------------+    | jenkins_admin_password | password | REDACTED | jenkins_admin_password |    | myapp_app_password     | password | REDACTED | DEMO_app_password      |    | myapp_client_psk       | string   | REDACTED | DEMO_client_ssid       |    | myapp_client_ssid      | string   | REDACTED | DEMO_client_ssid       |    | myapp_ondemand_wifi    | boolean  | REDACTED | DEMO_ondemand_wifi     |    | myapp_pi_password      | password | REDACTED | DEMO_pi_password       |    | trident_db_pass        | password | REDACTED | trident_db_pass        |    | trident_sysadmin_pass  | password | REDACTED | trident_sysadmin_pass  |    +------------------------+----------+----------+------------------------+..By default, the values of secrets are redacted when output.  To showthe values in clear text in the terminal output, add the ``--no-redact`` flag:.. code-block:: console    $ psec secrets show --no-redact    +------------------------+----------+------------------------------+------------------------+    | Variable               | Type     | Value                        | Export                 |    +------------------------+----------+------------------------------+------------------------+    | jenkins_admin_password | password | fetch.outsider.awning.maroon | jenkins_admin_password |    | myapp_app_password     | password | fetch.outsider.awning.maroon | DEMO_app_password      |    | myapp_client_psk       | string   | PSK                          | DEMO_client_psk        |    | myapp_client_ssid      | string   | SSID                         | DEMO_client_ssid       |    | myapp_ondemand_wifi    | boolean  | true                         | DEMO_ondemand_wifi     |    | myapp_pi_password      | password | fetch.outsider.awning.maroon | DEMO_pi_password       |    | trident_db_pass        | password | fetch.outsider.awning.maroon | trident_db_pass        |    | trident_sysadmin_pass  | password | fetch.outsider.awning.maroon | trident_sysadmin_pass  |    +------------------------+----------+------------------------------+------------------------+..If you don't care about redaction and want to turn it off and savethe dozen keystrokes it takes to type `` --no-redact``, you can exportthe environment variable ``D2_NO_REDACT`` set to (case-insensitive)&quot;true&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, or &quot;yes&quot;. Anything else leaves the default the same.We'll do this now for later examples... code-block:: console    $ export D2_NO_REDACT=true..The default is also to show all secrets.

When using the ``variable=value`` form of the ``secrets set``   command with a value that contains spaces, you **must** quote the value with   the double-quote character (``&quot;``) as opposed to the single-quote   (apostrophe, or ``'``) character. The Bash shell (and possibly other   shells) will not properly parse the command line and the resulting   ``sys.argv`` argument vector will be incorrectly set as seen here:   .. code-block:: console       _sys.argv[1:] = {list} &lt;class 'list'&gt;: ['--debug', 'secrets', 'set', 'trident_db_password=rural coffee purple sedan']        0 = {str} '--debug'        1 = {str} 'secrets'        2 = {str} 'set'        3 = {str} 'trident_db_password=rural coffee purple sedan'        __len__ = {int} 4       _sys.argv[1:] = {list} &lt;class 'list'&gt;: ['--debug', 'secrets', 'set', &quot;trident_db_password='rural&quot;, 'coffee', 'purple', &quot;sedan'&quot;]        0 = {str} '--debug'        1 = {str} 'secrets'        2 = {str} 'set'        3 = {str} 'trident_db_password=\\'rural'        4 = {str} 'coffee'        5 = {str} 'purple'        6 = {str} 'sedan\\''        __len__ = {int} 7..Or you can generate one or more variables in a similar manner by addingthem to the command line as arguments to ``secrets generate``:.. code-block:: console    $ psec secrets generate rabbitmq_default_user_pass rabbitmq_admin_user_pass    $ psec secrets show --column Variable --column Value    +----------------------------+----------------------------------------------+    | Variable                   | Value                                        |    +----------------------------+----------------------------------------------+    | trident_db_pass            | rural.coffee.purple.sedan                    |    | ca_rootca_password         | gargle.earlobe.eggplant.kissable             |    | consul_key                 | HEvUAItLFZ0+GjxfwTxLDKq5Fbt86UtXrInzpf71GGY= |    | jenkins_admin_password     | gargle.earlobe.eggplant.kissable             |    | rabbitmq_default_user_pass | embezzle.xerox.excess.skydiver               |    | rabbitmq_admin_user_pass   | embezzle.xerox.excess.skydiver               |    | trident_sysadmin_pass      | gargle.earlobe.eggplant.kissable             |    | vncserver_password         | gargle.earlobe.eggplant.kissable             |    | zookeeper_uuid4            | 769a77ad-b06f-4018-857e-23f970c777c2         |    +----------------------------+----------------------------------------------+..A set of secrets for an open source project can be bootstrapped using thefollowing steps:#. Create a template secrets environment directory that contains just   the secrets definitions. This example uses the template found   in the `davedittrich/goSecure`_ repository   (directory https://github.com/davedittrich/goSecure/tree/master/secrets).#. Use this template to clone a secrets environment, which will initially   be empty:   .. code-block:: console       $ psec environments create test --clone-from ~/git/goSecure/secrets       new password variable &quot;gosecure_app_password&quot; is unset       new string variable &quot;gosecure_client_ssid&quot; is unset       new string variable &quot;gosecure_client_ssid&quot; is unset       new string variable &quot;gosecure_client_psk&quot; is unset       new password variable &quot;gosecure_pi_password&quot; is unset       new string variable &quot;gosecure_pi_pubkey&quot; is unset       environment directory /Users/dittrich/.secrets/test created   ..   .. note::      The warnings about undefined new variables are presented on the standard      error file handle (a.k.a., ``&amp;2``). You get rid of them on the console by      redirecting ``stderr`` to ``/dev/null`` or a file:      .. code-block:: console          $ psec environments create test --clone-from ~/git/goSecure/secrets 2&gt;/dev/null          environment directory /Users/dittrich/.secrets/test created      ..   .. code-block:: console       $ psec -e test secrets show --no-redact --fit-width       +-----------------------+----------+-------+       | Variable              | Type     | Value |       +-----------------------+----------+-------+       | gosecure_app_password | password | None  |       | gosecure_client_ssid  | string   | None  |       | gosecure_client_psk   | string   | None  |       | gosecure_pi_password  | password | None  |       | gosecure_pi_pubkey    | string   | None  |       +-----------------------+----------+-------+   ..#. First, generate all secrets whose type is not ``string``:   .. code-block:: console       $ psec -e test secrets generate       new password variable &quot;gosecure_app_password&quot; is unset       new string variable &quot;gosecure_client_ssid&quot; is unset       new string variable &quot;gosecure_client_ssid&quot; is unset       new string variable &quot;gosecure_client_psk&quot; is unset       new password variable &quot;gosecure_pi_password&quot; is unset       new string variable &quot;gosecure_pi_pubkey&quot; is unset       $ psec -e test secrets show --no-redact --fit-width       +-----------------------+----------+------------------------------+       | Variable              | Type     | Value                        |       +-----------------------+----------+------------------------------+       | gosecure_app_password | password | brunt.outclass.alike.turbine |       | gosecure_client_psk   | string   | None                         |       | gosecure_client_ssid  | string   | None                         |       | gosecure_pi_password  | password | brunt.outclass.alike.turbine |       | gosecure_pi_pubkey    | string   | None                         |       +-----------------------+----------+------------------------------+   ..#.

Via (non-interactive) inline command subtitution from the terminal shell:   .. code-block:: console       $ psec -e xgt secrets set aws_cidr_allowed=&quot;$(psec utils myip --cidr)&quot;   ..#.

If you are using a mobile device    that is assigned differing DHCP addresses depending on location, the IP address    may change fairly regularly and the initial AWS Security Group setting will    begin to block access to your cloud instances. Programs like ``terraform``    can refresh their state, allowing you to simply reset the variable used to    create the Security Group and re-apply the plan to regenerate the AWS    Security Group and re-enable your remote access...Sharing secrets~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The ``psec`` program has a mechanism for sharing secrets withothers using GPG encrypted email messages for securing secrets in transitand at rest in users' inboxes. Email is sent using Google's OAuth2authenticated SMTP services... note::   The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has a `Surveillance Self-Defense   Guide`_ that includes guides on `How to Use PGP for Linux`_ and other operating   systems.

This can be done by passing the``.json`` secrets file itself to a program, or by outputting the variables inother formats like CSV, JSON, or as environment type variables.Passing the secrets file by path^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^One way to do this is to take advantage of command line options like`Ansible`_'s ``--extra-vars`` and passing it a path to the ``.json`` secretsfile.  (See `Passing Variables On The Command Line`_). Here is how to doit.Let's assume we want to use ``consul_key`` variable to configure Consulusing Ansible. Here is the variable as stored:.. code-block:: console    $ psec secrets show consul_key    +------------+-----------+----------------------------------------------+    | Variable   | Type      | Value                                        |    +------------+-----------+----------------------------------------------+    | consul_key | token_hex | HEvUAItLFZ0+GjxfwTxLDKq5Fbt86UtXrInzpf71GGY= |    +------------+-----------+----------------------------------------------+..Using Ansible's ``debug`` module, we can verify that this variable is notset by any previously loaded Ansible inventory:.. code-block:: console    $ ansible -i localhost, -m debug -a 'var=consul_key' localhost    localhost | SUCCESS =&gt; {        &quot;consul_key&quot;: &quot;VARIABLE IS NOT DEFINED!&quot;    }..In order for Ansible to set the ``consul_key`` variable outside of anypre-defined inventory files, we need to pass a file path to the``--extra-vars`` option. The path can be obtained using the``psec secrets path`` command:.. code-block:: console    $ psec secrets path    /Users/dittrich/.secrets/python_secrets/secrets.json..It is possible to run this command in an in-line command expansion operation inBash. Ansible expects the file path passed to ``-extra-vars`` to start with an``@`` character, so the command line to use would look like this:.. code-block:: console    $ ansible -i localhost, -e @&quot;$(psec secrets path)&quot; -m debug -a 'var=consul_key' localhost    localhost | SUCCESS =&gt; {        &quot;consul_key&quot;: &quot;HEvUAItLFZ0+GjxfwTxLDKq5Fbt86UtXrInzpf71GGY=&quot;    }..Ansible now has the value and can use it in templating configuration files, orso forth.Other programs like Hashicorp `terraform`_ look for environment variables thatbegin with ``TF_VAR_`` and use them to set ``terraform`` variables for usein modules. To prove we are running in a sub-shell, we will first change theshell prompt... code-block:: console    $ PS1=&quot;test&gt; &quot;    test&gt; psec -e test --export-env-vars --env-var-prefix=&quot;TEST_&quot; run bash    $ env | grep '^TEST_'    TEST_gosecure_pi_pubkey=ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC+qUIucrPvRkTmY0tgxr9ac/VtBUHhYHfOdDVpU99AcryLMWiU [...]    TEST_gosecure_client_psk=atjhK5AlsQMw3Zh    TEST_gosecure_client_ssid=YourWiFiSSID    TEST_gosecure_pi_password=brunt.outclass.alike.turbine    TEST_gosecure_app_password=brunt.outclass.alike.turbine    $ exit    test&gt;.... image:: https://asciinema.org/a/201510.png   :target: https://asciinema.org/a/201510?autoplay=1   :align: center   :alt: Exporting secrets via the environment   :width: 835px..Operational Security----------------------As noted in the Limitations section above, secrets are stored in plaintextplaintext form (i.e., they are *not* encrypted) in files. Those files are inturn stored in a directory in the file system, subject to Linux fileownership and permission access controls.The default location for storing these files is in an *environment directory*in a subdirectory of the user's home directory whose name starts with a periodcharacter (a.k.a., a *dot*).  Files (or directories) whose name starts with aperiod are known as *dot files*, or *hidden files* because the `ls` commanddoes not show it unless you use the `-a` flag.The secrets environment directories can also be used to store other filesbesides secrets. One such use case is storing JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) used asbearer tokens by protocols like Google's `OAuth 2.0 Mechanism`_ for securingaccess to web services and APIs. While this improves security in terms ofremote access, is not not without its own risks (including the JWT file beingstored in the file system for an indefinite period of time).* `JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are Dangerous for User Sessions—Here’s a  Solution`_, by Raja Rao, June 24, 2021* `Stop Using JSON Web Tokens For Authentication. Use Stateful Sessions  Instead`_, by Francisco Sainz, April 4, 2022* `What’s the Secure Way to Store JWT?`_, by Yang Liu, July 23, 2020Besides JWTs, other use cases for storing sensitive files within `psec`environments include backups of database contents, Let's Encrypt certificates,SSH keys, or other secrets necessary for ensuring cloud instances can bedestroyed and recreated without losing state or requiring regeneration(and redistribution or revalidation) of secrets.The output of `init --help` mentions this risk and offers a way to mitigatesome of the risk by locating the secrets storage base directory within adirectory that is stored on an encrypted USB-connected disk device or encrypteddisk image, or a removable device or remote file system, that is only mountedwhen needed and unmounted as soon as possible. This ensures sensitive data thatare not being actively used are left encrypted in storage.  The`D2_SECRETS_BASEDIR` environment variable or `-d` option allow you to specifythe directory to use.The `psec` CLI has a secure deletion mechanism that over-writes file contentsprior to deletion, helping to reduce leaving remnants of secrets in unallocatedfile system storage, similar to the way the Linux `shred` command works.Python Script Security----------------------Last, but certainly not least, take the time to read up on `Python Security`_and understand the types and sources of security vulnerabilities related toPython programs. Keep these ideas in mind when using and/or modifying thisprogram.As part of testing, the `Bandit`_ security validation program is used.(See `Getting started with Bandit`_)... _Bandit: https://pypi.org/project/bandit/.. _Getting started with Bandit: https://developer.rackspace.com/blog/getting-started-with-bandit/In situations where Bandit warnings can safely be ignored, the ``# nosec``comment appears on source code lines. Comments as to why these can besafely ignored are included in the code. (Please feel free to issue pullrequests if you disagree.)One runtime security mechanism employed by ``psec`` is control of the process'``umask``. This is important when running programs that create files, whichwill inherit their permissions per the process ``umask``. The ``umask`` will beinherited by every new child process and can be set in the user's ``.bashrc``(or other shell initialization) file.The ``psec run`` command can be used to run programs as child processes,optionally exporting environment variables as well, so controlling the``umask`` results in improved file permission security regardless ofwhether the user knows to set their process ``umask``.You can see the effect in these two examples.First, by setting the ``umask`` to ``0`` you see the very permissive filepermissions (as well as getting a warning from ``psec`` about finding a filewith lax permissions):.. code-block:: console    $ psec --umask 0o000 run -- dd if=/dev/random count=1 of=$(psec environments path --tmpdir)/foo    1+0 records in    1+0 records out    512 bytes copied, 0.000019 s, 2.7 MB/s    $ ls -l $(psec environments path --tmpdir)/foo    [!] file /Users/dittrich/.secrets/python_secrets/tmp/foo is mode 0o100666    -rw-rw-rw- 1 dittrich staff 512 Sep  8 13:05 /Users/dittrich/.secrets/python_secrets/tmp/foo    $ rm $(psec environments path --tmpdir)/foo..Now when using the default ``--umask`` value, the file permissions are restricted(and thus no more warning):.. code-block:: console    $ psec run -- dd if=/dev/random count=1 of=$(psec environments path --tmpdir)/foo    1+0 records in    1+0 records out    512 bytes copied, 0.000243 s, 2.1 MB/s    $ ls -l $(psec environments path --tmpdir)/foo    -rw------- 1 dittrich staff 512 Sep  8 13:04 /Users/dittrich/.secrets/python_secrets/tmp/foo    $ rm $(psec environments path --tmpdir)/foo..Bugs, Enhancements, and Future Work-----------------------------------Feature requests (and of course bug reports) are highly encouraged. You cando that by `opening an issue`_ on GitHub. Better yet, make a `pullrequest`_ with your own fix or feature. (Check there to see if onemay already exist.)If you want to help, there are some things that are on the &quot;to do&quot;list. These are tracked on this repository's GitHub `Projects`_ page.General or more elaborate potential enhancements are listed here:* Increase test coverage (test driven development is a Good Thing(TM))* The Mantl project (GitHub `mantl/mantl`_) employs a `security-setup`_ script  that takes care of setting secrets (and non-secret related variables) in a  monolithic manner.  It has specific command line options, specific secret  generation functions, and specific data structures for each of the component  subsystems used by `mantl/mantl`_. This method is not modular or extensible, and  the `security-setup`_ script is not generalized such that it can be used by  any other project.  These limitations are primary motivators for writing  ``python_secrets``, which could eventually replace ``security-setup``.  At this point, the Mantl ``security.yml`` file can be read in and  values can be manually set, as seen here:  .. code-block:: console      $ psec -d ~/git/mantl --secrets-file security.yml secrets show -f yaml      secrets descriptions directory not found      - Value: admin:password        Variable: chronos_http_credentials      - Value: chronos        Variable: chronos_principal      - Value: S0JMz5z8oxQGQXMyZjwE0ZCmu4zeJV4oWDUrdc25MBLx        Variable: chronos_secret      - Value: 88821cbe-c004-4cff-9f91-2bc36cd347dc        Variable: consul_acl_agent_token      - Value: f9acbe14-28d3-4d06-a1c9-c617da5ebb4e        Variable: consul_acl_mantl_api_token      - Value: de54ae85-8226-4146-959f-8926b0b8ee55        Variable: consul_acl_marathon_token      - Value: dfc9b244-5140-41ad-b93a-ac5c2451fb95        Variable: consul_acl_master_token      - Value: e149b50f-cb5c-4efe-be96-26a52efdc715        Variable: consul_acl_secure_token      - Value: 719f2328-6446-4647-adf6-310013bac636        Variable: consul_acl_vault_token      - Value: Z0niD1jeiTkx7xaoewJm2A==        Variable: consul_gossip_key      - Value: true        Variable: do_chronos_auth      - Value: true        Variable: do_chronos_iptables      - Value: true        Variable: do_chronos_ssl      - Value: true        Variable: do_consul_auth      - Value: true        Variable: do_consul_ssl      - Value: true        Variable: do_mantl_api_auth      - Value: true        Variable: do_mantlui_auth      - Value: true        Variable: do_mantlui_ssl      - Value: true        Variable: do_marathon_auth      - Value: true        Variable: do_marathon_iptables      - Value: true        Variable: do_marathon_ssl      - Value: true        Variable: do_mesos_auth      - Value: true        Variable: do_mesos_follower_auth      - Value: true        Variable: do_mesos_framework_auth      - Value: true        Variable: do_mesos_iptables      - Value: true        Variable: do_mesos_ssl      - Value: false        Variable: do_private_docker_registry      - Value: mantl-api        Variable: mantl_api_principal      - Value: Se4R9nRy8WTAgmU9diJyIPwLYsBU+V1yBxTQumiOriK+        Variable: mantl_api_secret      - Value: admin:password        Variable: marathon_http_credentials      - Value: marathon        Variable: marathon_principal      - Value: +Y5bvIsWliFvcWgbXGWa8kwT6Qf3etogQJe+cK+IV2hX        Variable: marathon_secret      - Value:        - principal: marathon          secret: +Y5bvIsWliFvcWgbXGWa8kwT6Qf3etogQJe+cK+IV2hX        - principal: chronos          secret: S0JMz5z8oxQGQXMyZjwE0ZCmu4zeJV4oWDUrdc25MBLx        - principal: mantl-api          secret: Se4R9nRy8WTAgmU9diJyIPwLYsBU+V1yBxTQumiOriK+        Variable: mesos_credentials      - Value: follower        Variable: mesos_follower_principal      - Value: Q53uAa2mNM0UNe2RUjrX6k7QvK6ojjH1gHXYLcm3Lmfr        Variable: mesos_follower_secret      - Value: password        Variable: nginx_admin_password      - Value: true        Variable: security_enabled      - Value: chronos        Variable: zk_chronos_user      - Value: JWPO11z4lU5qeilZ        Variable: zk_chronos_user_secret      - Value: hsr+R6YQBAOXoY84a8ne8bU0opg=        Variable: zk_chronos_user_secret_digest      - Value: marathon        Variable: zk_marathon_user      - Value: UBh77ok2svQAqWox        Variable: zk_marathon_user_secret      - Value: mo2mQGXcsc21zB4wYD18jn+Csks=        Variable: zk_marathon_user_secret_digest      - Value: mesos        Variable: zk_mesos_user      - Value: L3t9FEMsXehqeBvl        Variable: zk_mesos_user_secret      - Value: bHYvGteRBxou4jqJ8XWAYmOmzxs=        Variable: zk_mesos_user_secret_digest      - Value: super        Variable: zk_super_user      - Value: 2DyL/n/GLi3Q0pa75z9OjODGZKC1RCaEiKNV1ZXo1Wpk        Variable: zk_super_user_secret      $ psec -d ~/git/mantl --secrets-file security.yml secrets show -f csv | grep nginx_admin_password      secrets descriptions directory not found      &quot;nginx_admin_password&quot;,&quot;password&quot;      $ psec -d ~/git/mantl --secrets-file security.yml secrets set nginx_admin_password=newpassword      secrets descriptions directory not found      $ psec -d ~/git/mantl --secrets-file security.yml secrets show -f csv | grep nginx_admin_password      secrets descriptions directory not found      &quot;nginx_admin_password&quot;,&quot;newpassword&quot;  ..  There are a few things that can be done to use ``psec`` as a replacement  for the ``security-setup`` script.  These include:  * Produce secrets descriptions in a ``security.d`` directory.  * Remove the variables that are not secrets requiring regeneration for rotation    or &quot;break-glass&quot; procedures (e.g., like ``chronos_principal``, which is a    userID value, and ``do_mesos_auth``, which is a boolean flag).  * Break down more complex data structures (specifically, the ``mesos_credentials``    list of dictionaries with keys ``principal`` and ``secret``). These could    instead be discrete variables like ``marathon_secret`` (which appears to    be the secret associated with the invariant &quot;variable&quot; ``marathon_principal``).  .. note::     Alternatively, these kind of variables could be supported by defining a type ``invariant``     or ``string`` and prompting the user to provide a new value (using any current value     as the default).  ..Credits-------Tools used in rendering this package:*  Cookiecutter_*  `cookiecutter-pypackage`_Development of this program was supported in part under an Open SourceDevelopment Grant from the Comcast Innovation Fund... _Cookiecutter: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter.. _`cookiecutter-pypackage`: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage.. _openstack/cliff: https://github.com/openstack/cliff.. _python-update-dotdee: https://pypi.org/project/update-dotdee/.. _terraform: https://www.terraform.io/.. _Vault by Hashicorp: https://www.vaultproject.io/.. _mantl/mantl: https://github.com/mantl/mantl.. _security-setup: http://docs.mantl.io/en/latest/security/security_setup.html.. _Ansible: https://docs.ansible.com/.. _libfuse/sshfs: https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs.. _D2 Ansible Playbooks: https://github.com/davedittrich/ansible-dims-playbooks.. _Passing variables on the Command Line: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#passing-variables-on-the-command-line.. _OAuth 2.0 Mechanism: https://developers.google.com/gmail/imap/xoauth2-protocol... _davedittrich/goSecure: https://github.com/davedittrich/goSecure.. _Surveillance Self-Defense Guide: https://ssd.eff.org/en.. _opening an issue: https://github.com/davedittrich/python_secrets/issues.. _pull request: https://github.com/davedittrich/python_secrets/pulls.. _Projects: https://github.com/davedittrich/python_secrets/projects/1.. _How to Use PGP for Linux: https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-use-pgp-linux.. _Python Security: https://python-security.readthedocs.io/index.html.. _JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are Dangerous for User Sessions—Here’s a Solution: https://redis.com/blog/json-web-tokens-jwt-are-dangerous-for-user-sessions/.. _Stop Using JSON Web Tokens For Authentication.

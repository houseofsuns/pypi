	<longdescription># Kmerator## Prototype for decomposition of transcript or gene sequences and extraction of their specific k-mersref: &lt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8221386/&gt;Kmerator is a prototype tool designed for the prediction of specific k-mers (also called tags) from input sequences, considering a reference genome and an ENSEMBL-like transcriptome. From these specific k-mers, it also outputs their corresponding specific contigs which are sequences of consecutive k-mers (overlapping length between k-mers must be k-1, otherwise, it's a new contig). You need to provide kmerator with a jellifsh index of the reference genome. Kmerator itself builds a jellyfish index of the reference transcriptome (by default the latest available version of Ensembl). It then  decomposes your input transcript or gene sequences to count the occurences of each k-mer in the genome and transcriptome. Number of occurrences are then interpreted, in different manners, to select specific k-mer from your input. Before using kmerator, a jellyfish index of the reference genome must be created. kmerator automatically creates a dataset according to the species and the desired release number (by default, homo_sapiens and the latest version). The dataset is composed of 4 files per species/version: a jellyfish index of the modified transcriptome (cDNA + ncRNA - alternative chormosomes) from Ensembl, a binary file representing the same transcriptome, another binary file containing general information on the genes of the transcriptome and a report file.#### Specific kmers![](https://github.com/Transipedia/kmerator/raw/main/img/specific-kmers.png)#### Specific contigs![](https://github.com/Transipedia/kmerator/raw/main/img/specific-contigs.png)## Dependencies- Python &gt;= v3.7- Jellyfish &gt;= 2.0## Installation### Solution 1 (preferred)Install with pip```pip3 install kmerator```### Solution 2Installation from github```git clone https://github.com/Transipedia/kmerator3.gitln -s $PWD/kmerator3/kmerator/kmerator.py /usr/local/bin/kmerator  # or somewhere in your $PATH```## How to use kmeratorBefore all, remember that kmerator needs a jellyfish index of the genome. You must build it according to the species you are studying. You can store and name the index file whatever you want. Please note that you must **not use the jellyfish -C option** when building the reference genome index.### Configuration fileThe arguments to run kmerator are numerous, so to reduce the number of arguments to enter, it is advisable to edit the configuration file with the command :```kmerator -e```By filling in the `datadir` and `genome` directives, you will avoid having to re-enter the `--datadir` and `--genome` arguments systematically. If you are working on a species other than Human, you can also fill in the specie directive. And in a long-term project, you may want to set a release number.### Execute requestsThere are two main cases:- you find for specific k-mers for annotated genes or transcripts : use the `--selection` option, followed by:- the list of gene and/or transcripts separated by a space- or a file with the list of genes/transcripts. Separator could by a space, a tab or a newline, and comments are allowed (`#`)- you find for specific k-mers of unannotated sequences : use the `--fasta-file` option, followed by a fasta file containing yours requests. In case of you focuses on chimeras, add the `--chimera` option**Examples:**```kmerator -s npm1 brca2 ENST00000255409 ENSG00000159216    # you can mix genes and transcriptskmerator -s genes.txt                                     # you can also use a file with gene listkmerator -f file.fa                                       # give a fasta file fr unannotated sequences```**Note** the above commands assume that the configuration file contains at least the `datadir` and `genome` directives, the default species is homo_sapiens and the last available version will be used (if it is not present in datadir, kmerator will propose the construction of a dataset automatically)### Note the difference between genes and transcripts- When you are looking for specific kmers of a **gene** (symbol, alias or Ensembl name), kmerator fetch sequence of its canonical transcript, extracts kmers and keep those that found only in the gene.- When you are looking for a **transcript**, kmerator only keeps the kmer found in the transcript, and only in that transcript. If isoforms completely cover the transcript, no kmer will be kept.### DatasetsTo work, kmerator needs a jellyfish index of the genome, a jellyfish index of the transcriptome and various files. You will have to make the jellyfish genome index manually. Instead, kmerator builds the jellyfish transcriptome index and the files it needs, which we call datasets. There is one dataset per species and per transcriptome version. When kemrator does not find (in datadir) the requested transcriptome release (by default, the latest available on Ensembl), it offers to automatically build the dataset in question. In addition, dataset management options are available:```kmerator -l            # list local datasetskmerator -u            # find last release on Ensembl, and build dataset if not presentkmerator --mk-dataset  # build dataset according to -r &lt;release&gt; and -S &lt;specie&gt; argumentskmerator --rm-dataset  # delete dataset according to -r &lt;release&gt; and -S &lt;specie&gt; arguments```## All arguments```optional arguments:                                                                                        -h, --help            show this help message and exit                                                    -s SELECTION [SELECTION ...], --selection SELECTION [SELECTION ...]                                                            list of gene IDs (ENSG, gene Symbol or alias) or transcript IDs (ENST) from which you want to extract specific kmers from. For                                                                                     genes, kmerator search specific kmers along the gene. For transcripts, it search specific kmers to the transcript. You can also give                                                                               a file with yours genes/transcripts separated by space, tab or newline. If you want to use your own unannotated sequences, you must                                                                                give your fasta file with --fasta-file option.                                     -f FASTA_FILE, --fasta-file FASTA_FILE                                                                                         Use this option when yours sequences are unannonated or provided by a annotation file external from Ensembl. Otherwise, use                                                                                        --selection option.                                                                -d DATADIR, --datadir DATADIR                                             Storage directory for kmerator datasets.We recommend to set this parameter by editing the configuration file (kmerator --edit)                                                               -g GENOME, --genome GENOME                                                                                                     Genome jellyfish index (.jf) to use for k-mers requests.                                                                                                                                     -S SPECIE, --specie SPECIE                                                                                                                                                                                                               indicate a specie referenced in Ensembl, to help, follow the link https://rest.ensembl.org/documentation/info/species.

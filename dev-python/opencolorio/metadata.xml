OCIO provides a straightforward and consistent user experienceacross all supporting applications while allowing for sophisticated back-endconfiguration options suitable for high-end production usage. OCIO iscompatible with the Academy Color Encoding Specification (ACES) and isLUT-format agnostic, supporting many popular formats.OpenColorIO is released as version 2.0 and has been in development since 2003.OCIO represents the culmination of years of production experience earned onsuch films as SpiderMan 2 (2004), Surf's Up (2007), Cloudy with a Chance ofMeatballs (2009), Alice in Wonderland (2010), and many more. OpenColorIO isnatively supported in commercial applications like Katana, Mari, Nuke, Maya,Houdini, Silhouette FX, and[others](https://opencolorio.org/#supported_apps).OpenColorIO is free and open source software ([LICENSE](LICENSE)), andone of several projects actvively sponsored by the ASWF([Academy Software Foundation](https://www.aswf.io/)).OpenColorIO Project Mission---------------------------The OpenColorIO project is committed to providing an industry standard solution for highly precise, performant, and consistent color management across digital content creation applications and pipelines.OpenColorIO aims to:* be stable, secure, and thouroughly tested on Linux, macOS, and Windows* be performant on modern CPUs and GPUs* be simple, scalable, and well documented* be compatible with critical color and imaging standards* provide lossless color processing wherever possible* maintain config backwards compatability across major versions* have every new feature carefully reviewed by leaders from the motion picture,   VFX, animation, and video game industries* have a healthy and active community* receive wide industry adoptionOpenColorIO Project Governance------------------------------OpenColorIO is governed by the Academy Software Foundation (ASWF).

	<longdescription># ps2-analysis [WORK IN PROGRESS]*ps2-analysis* is a library written in Python &gt;= 3.8 that fetches data from theDaybreak Planetside 2 Census API and eases advanced analysis.It uses its sister project, the [ps2-census](https://github.com/spascou/ps2-census) clientwhose objective is simply to handle data retrieval from the Census API. Further parsingand exploitation is performed here in *ps2-analysis*.   * [ps2-analysis](#ps2-analysis)      * [Examples](#examples)      * [Development](#development)        * [Environment](#environment)*Features*:- Currently supports infantry and vehicle weapons data- Downloads datasets from the API and stores them locally as *ndjson* files- Parses data and generates class objects suitable for further processing## Installation```shpip install ps2-analysis```## ExamplesExamples are available in the `examples` folder:- `discover_infantry_weapons.py`: updates the infantry weapons datafile and outputs all different (nested) key paths as well as associated set of values encountered within the whole dataset; example output in `discover_infantry_weapons.json`- `discover_vehicle_weapons.py`: updates the vehicle weapons datafile and outputs all different (nested) key paths as well as associated set of values encountered within the whole dataset; example output in `discover_vehicle_weapons.json`- `generate_infantry_weapons.py`: no output; simply an example of `InfantryWeapon` objects generation- `generate_vehicle_weapons.py`: no output; simply an example of `VehicleWeapon` objects generation## Development### EnvironmentIn order to develop *ps2-analysis*:- Setup a virtual environment with python 3.8- Install [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry)- Install dependencies with `poetry install`- Run tests with `pytest`- Update dependencies with `poetry update`To run the examples in the `examples` folder:- Add your Census API service ID to the `CENSUS_SERVICE_ID` environment variable- Create a folder inside the `examples` folder of the cloned repository: `datafiles`- Run the scripts and check the outputs</longdescription>

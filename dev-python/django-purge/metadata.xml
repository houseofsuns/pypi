You can also make FilePurgers which can purge old files based ondatestamps in the filename or timestamps in the meta-data (atime/mtime/ctime).How to Use##########.. code-block:: shell    $ pip install django-purgeInclude :code:`purge` in your :code:`INSTALLED_APPS`. Then, create yourdatabase purgers or file purgers in the admin interface.Then, either periodically call the :code:`purge` management command (e.g., via asystem cronjob), or install and configure :code:`django-cron` (add:code:`purge.cron` to your :code:`CRON_CLASSES` in your:code:`settings.py`). The builtin :code:`CronJob` class is set to run every 4hours. You can change this by altering your :code:`settings.py` and adding:code:`PURGE_CRON_RUN_AT_TIMES` to an array of times you want to run the job at(e.g., :code:`['1:00']` to run at 1am).Contributing############Email gschmi4@uic.edu if you want to contribute. You must only contribute codethat you have authored or otherwise hold the copyright to, and you mustmake any contributions to this project available under the MIT license.To collaborators: don't push using the :code:`--force` option.Dev Quickstart##############Purge comes with a `settings.py` file, technically making it a Django project aswell as a Django app. First clone, the repository into a location of yourchoosing:.. code-block:: shell    $ git clone https://github.com/gregschmit/django-purgeThen you can go into the :code:`django-purge` directory and do the initialmigrations and run the server (you may need to type :code:`python3` rather than:code:`python`):.. code-block:: shell    $ cd django-purge    $ python manage.py makemigrations    $ python manage.py migrate    $ python manage.py createsuperuser    ...    $ python manage.py runserverThen you can see the models at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin.</longdescription>

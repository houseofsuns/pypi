	<longdescription># Cove Unified LogsCove Unified Logs is a Python library for handling logs in various environments (Django, AWS Lambda, Google Cloud) and pushing them to AWS CloudWatch in an asynchronous way.## Author**SARVPRIYE SONI**- Github: [@Cove-Identity](https://github.com/Cove-Identity/cove-unified-logs)- Email: sarvpriye.soni@coveidentity.com- Website: [Cove Identity](https://coveidentity.com)## Check out products from Cove Identity- Cove Identity: [Cove Identity](https://www.coveidentity.com/cove-identity-app)- Cove Drive: [Cove Drive](https://drive.coveidentity.com)## InstallationUse the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Cove Unified Logs.```bashpip install cove_unified_logs```# AWS Credentials ConfigurationTo interact with AWS services, Cove Unified Logs uses boto3, the AWS SDK for Python. You need to configure your AWS credentials for use with boto3. Here's how:1) **Environment Variables:** Set the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` (optional for when you are using AWS STS temporary credentials) environment variables.2) **Shared Credential File (~/.aws/credentials):** Use an AWS credentials file to specify your credentials. The default location is `~/.aws/credentials`.3) **AWS Config File (~/.aws/config):** Similar to the credentials file, you can also have a configuration file. The default location is ~/.aws/config. This file allows you to specify your region along with your credentials. 4) **IAM Role:** If your application is running on an EC2 instance, you can assign an IAM role to the instance with the necessary permissions, and the boto3 client will automatically use the credentials from the IAM role.For more information, check the [official Boto3 documentation](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/quickstart.html#configuration).#UsageTo use Cove Unified Logs in a Python application, first create an instance of the UnifiedLogger class:```pythonfrom cove_unified_logs import UnifiedLoggerlogger = UnifiedLogger('your-app-name', config='all')```You can then use this logger to log messages at different levels:```pythonlogger.debug('This is a debug message')logger.info('This is an info message')logger.warning('This is a warning message')logger.error('This is an error message')logger.critical('This is a critical message')```    Each log message is automatically annotated with metadata including the app name, timestamp, and log level.##Django MiddlewareTo use Cove Unified Logs as middleware in a Django application, first add the middleware to your `MIDDLEWARE` setting:```# settings.pyMIDDLEWARE = [    ...    'cove_unified_logs.middleware.LoggingMiddleware',    ...]```Next, add the log level to your settings:```python# settings.pyLOG_LEVEL = 'debug'  # or 'info', 'warning', 'error', 'critical'```Finally, in the module where you initialize your `UnifiedLogger`, set the log level from your settings:```python# your file where UnifiedLogger is usedfrom django.conf import settingsfrom cove_unified_logs import UnifiedLoggerapp_name = apps.get_app_config(__package__.split('.')[0]).verbose_namelogger = UnifiedLogger(app_name, config='all')logger.set_level(settings.LOG_LEVEL)```Remember to replace 'your-app-name' with the name of your application, and to adjust the apps.get_app_config(__package__.split('.')[0]).verbose_name line as necessary for your project structure.##Running the Log Consumer1. The `LogConsumer` class is responsible for consuming logs from a Redis queue and sending them to AWS CloudWatch. You can run it as a standalone service in your infrastructure.```pythonfrom cove_unified_logs.log_consumer import LogConsumerfrom cove_unified_logs.cloud_logger import CloudLoggercloud_logger = CloudLogger(group_name='log-group', stream_name='log-stream', region_name='eu-west-1', flush_interval=10, batch_size=100)consumer = LogConsumer(cloud_logger=cloud_logger)consumer.run()```2. **Environment Variables**: The script uses the following environment variables for Redis configuration:`REDIS_HOST`: The hostname of your Redis server.`REDIS_PORT`: The port number on which your Redis server is running.`REDIS_PASSWORD`: The password for your Redis server. (Optional)Make sure these environment variables are set correctly in your environment.3. Running the Script: To run the script, navigate to the root directory of this repository and use the following command:Remember, the consumer is designed to be long-running and should be managed with a process supervisor to ensure it stays running.Please make sure to adapt these instructions to your actual setup and include any additional steps or information that might be necessary.##ContributingPull requests are welcome.

For more information see the  `full documentation &lt;api.html#invenio_base.wsgi.wsgi_proxyfix&gt;`_.- Deprecates the usage of ``WSGI_PROXIES`` configuration which only supports  ``X-Forwarded-For`` headers.Version 1.1.0 (released 2019-07-29)- Add support for allowing instance path and static folder to be callables  which are evaluated before being passed to the Flask application class. This  fixes an issue in pytest-invenio and Invenio-App in which a global instance  path was only evaluated once.- Fixes deprecation warnings from Werkzeug.Version 1.0.2 (released 2018-12-14)Version 1.0.1 (released 2018-05-25)- Added support for blueprint factory functions in the  ``invenio_base.blueprints`` and the ``invenio_base.api_blueprints`` entry  point groups. In addition to specifying an import path to an already created  blueprint, you can now specify an import path of a blueprint factory function  with the signature create_blueprint(app), that will create and return a  blueprint. This allows moving dynamic blueprint creation from the extension  initialization phase to the blueprint registration phase.Version 1.0.0 (released 2018-03-23)- Initial public release.</longdescription>

	<longdescription># nhp-prepThis is a CLI Tool that has been created to pre-process historical data that has been collectedin multiple instances. This includes data collected at Seneca Zoo and Mellon Institute.### RequirementsThis package ***requires Python 3.***### InstallingTo install this CLI tool you can run the below command```pip3 install nhp-prep```### UpdatingIf you already have this tool installed, you can update it to the latest stable release by using the following command:```pip3 install -U nhp-prep```Alternatively, you clone this repo and then run this command from **_within_** the repository folder```python3 setup.py install```Another way to install this solution is by running the following command from **_within_** the repository folder:```pip install -e .```Both the above commands would install the package globally and `nhp-prep` will be available on your system.### How to useThere are multiple instances in which you can use this tool.```nhp-prep COMMAND [OPTIONS]```There are four use-cases (commands) in which you can use this tool:1. Mapping columns from prior to current format (`reorder-columns`)```nhp-prep reorder-columns -i &lt;directory_with_files_to_reorder_columns_OR_unique_CSV_file&gt; -o &lt;output_directory&gt; -r &lt;file_with_reference_columns&gt;```2. Rename the files to follow current standard (`rename`)```nhp-prep rename -i &lt;directory_files_to_rename_OR_uniques_CSV_file&gt; -o &lt;output_directory&gt;```The current format for the file is: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHmmh_&lt;experiment_name&gt;_&lt;Subject_name&gt;_&lt;Researcher_name_or_initials&gt;_data.csv`3. Timestamp estimation trials from historical data files based on column &lt;X&gt; (`timestamp-estimate`)```nhp-prep --timestamp-estimate -i &lt;input_file&gt;```Alternatively, you can pass the directory of the files to estimate the timestamp of each trial:```nhp-prep timestamp-estimate -i &lt;directory_with_files_OR_unique_CSV_file&gt;```##### **Since v0.3.0**Since the previous 3 steps are common across the different datasets collected, the dev team decided to merge them into one single command (`preparation-steps`):```nhp-prep preparation-steps -i &lt;input_directory&gt; -o &lt;output_directory&gt;```***The previous command will run sequentially the steps 1 to 3. The only command left outside of the bundle is the #4 since that is only applicable for the Baboons' data and requires the additional reference file.***4. Renaming of Subject according to logs file (needs the file) (`sub-rename`)```nhp-prep sub-rename -r &lt;file_with_columns_and_reference_subject_names&gt; -i &lt;directory_with_files_OR_unique_CSV_file&gt; -o &lt;output_directory&gt;```You could also run `nhp-prep --help` to see the available commands and their corresponding usage.If you want to know all the options available for an specific command, run the following:```nhp-prep COMMAND --help```Example:```nhp-prep sub-rename --help```### FeedbackPlease feel free to leave feedback in issues/PRs.</longdescription>

	<longdescription>event-routing-backends=============================|pypi-badge| |ci-badge| |codecov-badge| |doc-badge| |pyversions-badge||license-badge|Various backends for retransmitting edX LMS events to external services.Overview--------event-routing-backends contains plugins for the `event-tracking`_ app that is installed as a part of edx-platform. It provides a backend that can take events and re-transmit them to external services.  It also provides some new processers that can convert edx-platform events into other formats.Currently work to support xAPI and Caliper event formats is in progress.See `OEP 26`_ for background; the xAPI and Caliper subdocuments in particular include a specification of how LMS events will be translated to the format of the respective protocols... _event-tracking: https://github.com/openedx/event-tracking.. _OEP 26: https://open-edx-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oep-0026-arch-realtime-events.htmlDocumentation-------------Documentation for this repo is published to `Read the Docs &lt;https://event-routing-backends.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`_License-------The code in this repository is licensed under the AGPL 3.0 unlessotherwise noted.Please see `LICENSE.txt &lt;LICENSE.txt&gt;`_ for details.How To Contribute-----------------Contributions are very welcome.Please read `How To Contribute &lt;https://github.com/openedx/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md&gt;`__ for details.should be followed for all Open edX projects.The pull request description template should be automatically applied if you are creating a pull request from GitHub.

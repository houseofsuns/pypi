	<longdescription>BottomBar=========Bottombar is a Python module that facilitates printing a status line at thebottom of a terminal window. The module functions as a state machine, andallows multiple, individually submitted status items to be displayedsimultaneously.Requirements------------A VT100-capable terminal is required. Most Linux terminals qualify, includingXterm, Rxvt, Gnome terminal, Kitty terminal, and Alacritty. On MS Windows thenew [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/windowsterminal) is recommended.Other than this BottomBar has no dependencies beyond Python version 3.3.How to use it-------------A bar entry is created using the module's `add` context, and displayed for theduration that the context is entered. It also activates an event handler thatreformats and redraws the bar whenever the terminal window is resized.```python&gt;&gt;&gt; import bottombar as bb&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; with bb.add('bottom bar', label='powered by') as item:...     print('regular output')# regular output                                                              ## powered by: bottom bar                                                      #```Items can be modified in place:```python...     item.text = 'bottom bar v2'# powered by: bottom bar v2                                                   #```Labels are optional, and multiple items can be stacked:```python...     with bb.add('more bar text'):# regular output                                                              ## powered by: bottom bar v2 | more bar text                                   #```Items can be right-aligned:```python...         with bb.add('12:00', label='time', right=True):# regular output                                                              ## powered by: bottom bar v2 | more bar text                       time: 12:00 #```If items no longer fit the bar then labels are dropped to make room:```python...             with bb.add('more right-aligned bar text', right=True):# regular output                                                              ## bottom bar v2 | more bar text           more right-aligned bar text | 12:00 #```If this is not enough, long text entries are truncated:```python...                 with bb.add('this is getting too much'):# regular output                                                              ## bottom bar v2 | more bar text | this is gettin..   more right-ali.. | 12:00 #```The bar is automatically redrawn whenever its contents change. Content thatchanges dynamically can be refreshed at a configured rate:```python&gt;&gt;&gt; import time&gt;&gt;&gt; class Clock:...     def __str__(self):...         return time.strftime('%H:%M:%S')&gt;&gt;&gt; with bb.add(Clock(), label='time', right=True, refresh=1):#                                                              time: 12:00:00 ##                                                              time: 12:00:01 ##                                                              time: 12:00:02 #```In case multiple refresh rates are configured simultaneously, the fastest rateprevails.Technical details-----------------The status line is positioned, and kept in position, using [VT100 escapesequences](https://vt100.net/docs/vt100-ug/). By configuring a scroll regionthat excludes the bottom line, regular output will scroll above it withoutfurther intervention.The implementaton of automatic redrawing depends on the platform. On Unix-likesystems both resize events and the redraw rate are handled using signals:`SIGWINCH` and `SIGALRM`. Pre-existing handlers for the former remain active,while those for the latter are disabled for the duration that a bar is active.On other platforms a thread is spawned that polls the terminal size once everysecond, as well as redraws the bar at the configured interval.</longdescription>

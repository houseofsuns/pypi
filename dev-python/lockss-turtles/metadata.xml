You can check at the command line that the installation is functional by running ``turtles version`` or ``turtles --help``.Prerequisites=============*  `Python &lt;https://www.python.org/&gt;`_ 3.7 or greater.*  Additional prerequisites depending on the types of `Plugin Set Builders`_ or `Plugin Registry Layouts`_ in use (see their respective requirements).Prerequisites for development work only:*  `Poetry &lt;https://python-poetry.org/&gt;`_ 1.4 or greater... _pip:``pip``=======You can install Turtles with ``pip``.To install it in your own non-root, non-virtual environment, use the ``--user`` option::   pip3 install --user lockss-turtlesTo install it in a virtual environment, simply use::   pip3 install lockss-turtles.. danger::   Do not run ``pip3``/``pip`` as ``root``, with ``sudo`` or otherwise.--------Overview--------Building Plugins================You can use Turtles to build (package and sign) LOCKSS plugins from one or more LOCKSS plugin sets (codebases containing plugins).You will need to define one or more `Plugin Sets`_, list them in a `Plugin Set Catalog`_, and declare your `Plugin Signing Credentials`_.You then use the `build-plugin`_ command to build plugins, or the `release-plugin`_ command to build and deploy plugins (equivalent of `build-plugin`_ followed by `deploy-plugin`_).Deploying Plugins=================You can use Turtles to deploy LOCKSS plugins to LOCKSS plugin registries.You will need to define one or more `Plugin Registries`_ and declare them in a `Plugin Registry Catalog`_.You then use the `deploy-plugin`_ command to deploy plugin JARs, or the `release-plugin`_ command to build and deploy plugins from `Plugin Sets`_ (equivalent of `build-plugin`_ followed by `deploy-plugin`_).-------------------Configuration Files-------------------All Turtles configuration files are YAML files and have a top-level ``kind`` key that declares what kind of configuration file it is.Some Turtles commands require a `Plugin Set Catalog`_, `Plugin Registry Catalog`_, or `Plugin Signing Credentials`_. You can specify the configuration file to use via the appropriate command line option (for example |PLUGIN_SET_CATALOG|). Otherwise, Turtles will look for then appropriate configuration file (for example ``plugin-set-catalog.yaml``) in several standard directories, in this order:*  ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lockss.turtles`` (by default ``$HOME/.config/lockss.turtles``)*  ``/usr/local/share/lockss.turtles``*  ``/etc/lockss.turtles``Plugin Set Catalog==================Turtles commands that are `Building Plugins`_ (`build-plugin`_, `release-plugin`_) need a plugin set catalog. It can be specified via the |PLUGIN_SET_CATALOG| option, otherwise Turtles looks through `Configuration Files`_ for a file named ``plugin-set-catalog.yaml``.A plugin set catalog is defined by a YAML document::    ---    kind: PluginSetCatalog    plugin-set-files:      - /path/to/some/file1.yaml      - /path/to/another/file2.yaml      - ...The contents are described below:``kind``   *Required.* Must be set to ``PluginSetCatalog``.``plugin-set-files``   *Required.* A list of one or more paths to `Plugin Sets`_.Plugin Sets===========A plugin set is a project containing the source code of one or more LOCKSS plugins.A plugin set is defined by a YAML document::    ---    kind: PluginSet    id: mypluginset    name: My Plugin Set    builder:      type: ...      ...The contents are described below:``kind``   *Required.* Must be set to ``PluginSet``.``id``   *Required.* A short identifier for the plugin set, for example ``mypluginset``.``name``   *Required.* A display name for the plugin set, for example ``My Plugin Set``.``builder``   *Required.* An object defining the plugin set's builder together with its options.   ``type``      *Required.* A plugin set builder type. See `Plugin Set Builders`_ below.   Other      Additional properties depending on the plugin set builder type. See `Plugin Set Builders`_ below.Plugin Set Builders===================Turtles `Plugin Sets`_ support two types of plugin set builders:*  `Maven Plugin Set Builder`_*  `Ant Plugin Set Builder`_Maven Plugin Set Builder------------------------This type of plugin set builder is for a Maven project inheriting from ``org.lockss:lockss-plugins-parent-pom``.Maven Plugin Set Builder Prerequisites++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*  Java Development Kit 8 (JDK).*  `Apache Maven &lt;https://maven.apache.org/&gt;`_.Maven Plugin Set Builder Declaration++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++For this plugin set builder type, the ``builder`` object in the plugin set definition has the following structure::    ---    kind: PluginSet    id: ...    name: ...    builder:      type: mvn      main: ...      test: ...``type``   *Required.* Must be set to ``mvn``.``main``   *Optional.* The path (relative to the root of the project) to the plugins' source code. *Default:* ``src/main/java``.``test``   *Optional.* The path (relative to the root of the project) to the plugins' unit tests. *Default:* ``src/test/java``.Ant Plugin Set Builder----------------------This type of plugin set builder is for the LOCKSS 1.x (https://github.com/lockss/lockss-daemon) code tree, based on Ant.Ant Plugin Set Builder Prerequisites++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*  Java Development Kit 8 (JDK).*  `Apache Ant &lt;https://ant.apache.org/&gt;`_.*  ``JAVA_HOME`` must be set appropriately.Ant Plugin Set Builder Declaration++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++For this plugin set builder type, the ``builder`` object in the plugin set definition has the following structure::    ---    kind: PluginSet    id: ...    name: ...    builder:      type: ant      main: ...      test: ...``type``   *Required.* Must be set to ``ant``.``main``   *Optional.* The path (relative to the root of the project) to the plugins' source code. *Default:* ``plugins/src``.``test``   *Optional.* The path (relative to the root of the project) to the plugins' unit tests. *Default:* ``plugins/test/src``.Plugin Registry Catalog=======================Turtles commands that are `Deploying Plugins`_ (`deploy-plugin`_, `release-plugin`_) need a plugin registry catalog. It can be specified via the |PLUGIN_REGISTRY_CATALOG| option, otherwise Turtles looks through `Configuration Files`_ for a file named ``plugin-registry-catalog.yaml``.A plugin set catalog is defined by a YAML document::    ---    kind: PluginRegistryCatalog    plugin-registry-files:      - /path/to/some/file1.yaml      - /path/to/another/file2.yaml      - ...The contents are described below:``kind``   *Required.* Must be set to ``PluginRegistryCatalog``.``plugin-registry-files``   *Required.* A list of one or more paths to `Plugin Registries`_.Plugin Registries=================A plugin registry is a structure containing LOCKSS plugins packaged as signed JAR files.Currently the only predefined structures are directory structures local to the file system, which are then typically served by a Web server.A plugin registry is defined by a YAML document::    ---    kind: PluginRegistry    id: mypluginregistry    name: My Plugin Registry    layout:      type: ...      ...    layers:      - ...    plugin-identifiers:      - edu.myuniversity.plugin.publisherx.PublisherXPlugin      - edu.myuniversity.plugin.publishery.PublisherYPlugin      - ...    suppressed-plugin-identifiers:      - edu.myuniversity.plugin.old.OldPlugin      - ...The contents are described below:``kind``   *Required.* Must be set to ``PluginRegistry``.``id``   *Required.* A short identifier for the plugin registry, for example ``mypluginregistry``.``name``   *Required.* A display name for the plugin registry, for example ``My Plugin Registry``.``layout``   *Required.* An object defining the plugin registry's layout together with its options.   ``type``      *Required.* A plugin registry layout type. See `Plugin Registry Layouts`_ below.   Other      Additional properties depending on the plugin registry layout type. See `Plugin Registry Layouts`_ below.``layers``   *Required.* A list of objects describing the layers of the plugin registry. See `Plugin Registry Layers`_ below.``plugin-identifiers``   *Required.* Non-empty list of the plugin identifiers in this plugin registry.``suppressed-plugin-identifiers``   *Optional.* Non-empty list of plugin identifiers that are excluded from this plugin registry.   Turtles does not currently do anything with this information, but it can be used to record plugins that have been abandoned or retracted over the lifetime of the plugin registry.   Turtles does not currently do anything with this information, but it can be used to record plugins that have been abandoned or retracted over the lifetime of the plugin registry.Plugin Registry Layouts=======================Turtles supports two kinds of plugin registry layouts:*  `Directory Plugin Registry Layout`_*  `RCS Plugin Registry Layout`_Directory Plugin Registry Layout--------------------------------In this type of plugin registry layout, each layer consists of a directory on the local file system where signed plugin JARs are stored, which is then typically served by a Web server. The directory for each layer is designated by the layer's ``path`` property.Directory Plugin Registry Layout Prerequisites++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++None.Directory Plugin Registry Layout Declaration++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++For this plugin registry layout type, the ``layout`` object in the plugin registry definition has the following structure::    ---    kind: PluginRegistry    id: ...    name: ...    layout:      type: directory      file-naming-convention: ...    layers:      - ...    plugin-identifiers:      - ...    suppressed-plugin-identifiers:      - ...``type``   *Required.* Must be set to ``directory``.``file-naming-convention``   *Optional.* A rule for what to name each deployed JAR file. If unspecified, the behavior is that of ``identifier``. Can be one of:   *  ``identifier``: Use the plugin identifier and add ``.jar``. For example ``edu.myuniversity.plugin.publisherx.PublisherXPlugin`` results in ``edu.myuniversity.plugin.publisherx.PublisherXPlugin.jar``.   *  ``underscore``: Replace ``.`` in the plugin identifier with ``_``, and add ``.jar``. For example ``edu.myuniversity.plugin.publisherx.PublisherXPlugin`` results in ``edu_myuniversity_plugin_publisherx_PublisherXPlugin.jar``.   *  ``abbreviated``: Use the last dotted component of the plugin identifier and add ``.jar``. For example ``edu.myuniversity.plugin.publisherx.PublisherXPlugin`` results in ``PublisherXPlugin.jar``.RCS Plugin Registry Layout--------------------------In this specialization of the `Directory Plugin Registry Layout`_, each successive version of a given JAR is kept locally in RCS.RCS Plugin Registry Layout Prerequisites++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*  `GNU RCS &lt;https://www.gnu.org/software/rcs/&gt;`_.RCS Plugin Registry Layout Declaration++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++For this plugin registry layout type, the ``layout`` object in the plugin registry definition has the following structure::    ---    kind: PluginRegistry    id: ...    name: ...    layout:      type: rcs      file-naming-convention: ...    layers:      - ...    plugin-identifiers:      - ...    suppressed-plugin-identifiers:      - ...``type``   *Required.* Must be set to ``rcs``.``file-naming-convention``   *Optional.* A rule for what to name each deployed JAR file. If unspecified, the behavior is that of ``identifier``. Can be one of:   *  ``identifier``: Use the plugin identifier and add ``.jar``. For example ``edu.myuniversity.plugin.publisherx.PublisherXPlugin`` results in ``edu.myuniversity.plugin.publisherx.PublisherXPlugin.jar``.   *  ``underscore``: Replace ``.`` in the plugin identifier with ``_``, and add ``.jar``. For example ``edu.myuniversity.plugin.publisherx.PublisherXPlugin`` results in ``edu_myuniversity_plugin_publisherx_PublisherXPlugin.jar``.   *  ``abbreviated``: Use the last dotted component of the plugin identifier and add ``.jar``. For example ``edu.myuniversity.plugin.publisherx.PublisherXPlugin`` results in ``PublisherXPlugin.jar``.Plugin Registry Layers======================A plugin registry consists of one or more layers.Some plugin registries only one layer, in which case the LOCKSS boxes in a network using the plugin registry will get what is released to it. Some plugin registries may have two or more layers, with the additional layers used for plugin development or content processing quality assurance.Layers are sequential in nature; a new version of a plugin is released to the lowest layer first, then to the next layer (after some process), and so on until the highest layer. This sequencing is reflected in the ordering of the ``layers`` list in the plugin registry definition.Although the identifiers (see ``id`` below) and display names (see ``name`` below) of plugin registry layers are arbitrary, the highest layer is commonly referred to as the *production* layer, and when there are exactly two layers, the lower layer is commonly referred to as the *testing* layer. Turtles reflects this common idiom with built-in |PRODUCTION| and |TESTING| options that are shorthand for ``--layer=production`` and ``--layer=testing`` respectively.It is possible for multiple plugin registries to have a layer ``path`` in common. An example would be a team working on several plugin registries for different purposes, having distinct (public) production layer paths, but sharing a single (internal) testing layer path, if they are the only audience for it.A plugin registry layer is defined as one of the objects in the plugin registry definition's ``layers`` list. Each layer object has the following structure::    ---    kind: PluginRegistry    id: ...    name: ...    layout:      type: ...      ...    layers:      - id: testing        name: My Plugin Registry (Testing)        path: /path/to/testing      - id: production        name: My Plugin Registry (Production)        path: /path/to/production      - ...    plugin-identifiers:      - ...    suppressed-plugin-identifiers:      - ...``id``   *Required.* A short identifier for the plugin registry layer, for example ``testing``.``name``   *Required.* A display name for the plugin registry layer, for example ``My Plugin Registry (Testing)``.``path``   *Required.* The local path to the root of the plugin registry layer, for example ``/path/to/testing``.Plugin Signing Credentials==========================Turtles commands that are `Building Plugins`_ (`build-plugin`_, `release-plugin`_) need a reference to plugin signing credentials. They can be specified via the |PLUGIN_SIGNING_CREDENTIALS| option, otherwise Turtles looks through `Configuration Files`_ for a file named ``plugin-signing-credentials.yaml``.Plugin signing credentials are defined by a YAML document::    ---    kind: PluginSigningCredentials    plugin-signing-keystore: /path/to/myalias.keystore    plugin-signing-alias: myaliasThe contents are described below:``kind``   *Required.* Must be set to ``PluginSigningCredentials``.``plugin-signing-keystore``   *Required.* Path to the plugin signing key (keystore).``plugin-signing-alias``   *Required.* The alias to use, which must be that of the plugin signing key (keystore) and also found in the LOCKSS network's shared keystore.-----------------Command Line Tool-----------------Turtles is invoked at the command line as::   turtlesor as a Python module::   python3 -m lockss.turtlesHelp messages and this document use ``turtles`` throughout, but the two invocation styles are interchangeable.Synopsis========Turtles uses `Commands`_, in the style of programs like ``git``, ``dnf``/``yum``, ``apt``/``apt-get``, and the like. You can see the list of available `Commands`_ by invoking ``turtles --help``, and you can find a usage summary of all the `Commands`_ by invoking ``turtles usage``::    usage: turtles [-h] [--debug-cli] [--non-interactive] COMMAND ...           turtles build-plugin [-h] [--output-format FMT] [--password PASS]                                [--plugin-set-catalog FILE]                                [--plugin-signing-credentials FILE]                                [--identifier PLUGID] [--identifiers FILE]                                [PLUGID ...]           turtles copyright [-h]           turtles deploy-plugin [-h] [--output-format FMT]                                 [--plugin-registry-catalog FILE] [--production]                                 [--testing] [--jar PLUGJAR] [--jars FILE]                                 [--layer LAYER] [--layers FILE]                                 [PLUGJAR ...]           turtles license [-h]           turtles release-plugin [-h] [--output-format FMT] [--password PASS]                                  [--plugin-registry-catalog FILE]                                  [--plugin-set-catalog FILE]                                  [--plugin-signing-credentials FILE]                                  [--production] [--testing] [--identifier PLUGID]                                  [--identifiers FILE] [--layer LAYER]                                  [--layers FILE]                                  [PLUGID ...]           turtles usage [-h]           turtles version [-h]Commands========The available commands are:================= ============ =======Command           Abbreviation Purpose================= ============ =======`build-plugin`_   bp           build (package and sign) plugins`copyright`_                   show copyright and exit`deploy-plugin`_  dp           deploy plugins`license`_                     show license and exit`release-plugin`_ rp           release (build and deploy) plugins`usage`_                       show detailed usage and exit`version`_                     show version and exit================= ============ =======Top-Level Program-----------------The top-level executable alone does not perform any action or default to a given command.

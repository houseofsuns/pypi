I didn't want to have to fiddle with the command-line, and also wanted a cross-platform solution. Thus was born `chime`!## Installation```shpip install chime```This library has **no dependencies**. The IPython/Jupyter functionality is only imported if you've installed the `ipython` library. It should work for any Python version above or equal to 3.6.## Basic usage`chime` puts four functions at your disposal:```py&gt;&gt;&gt; import chime&gt;&gt;&gt; chime.success()&gt;&gt;&gt; chime.warning()&gt;&gt;&gt; chime.error()&gt;&gt;&gt; chime.info()```Calling any of the above functions will play a sound. Note that the sounds are played in asynchronous processes, and are thus non-blocking. Each function should take around 2ms to execute, regardless of the sound length. You're free to use each sound notification in any way you see fit. I'm not your mama.## ThemingThe sounds that are played depend on which theme is being used.```py&gt;&gt;&gt; chime.theme()  # return the current theme'chime'```Several themes are available:```py&gt;&gt;&gt; chime.themes()['big-sur', 'chime', 'mario', 'material', 'pokemon', 'sonic', 'zelda']```The theme can be changed by passing a theme name to the `theme` function:```py&gt;&gt;&gt; chime.theme('zelda')```A couple of things to note:- You can listen to the sounds interactively via [this soundboard](https://chime-soundboard.herokuapp.com/), which is made with [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/).- A random theme will be picked each time you play a sound if you set the theme to `'random'`.## IPython/Jupyter magicLoad the extension as so:```py%load_ext chime```You can wrap a line:```py%chime print(&quot;I'm a line&quot;)```You can also wrap an entire cell:```py%%chimeprint(&quot;I'm a cell&quot;)```The magic command will call `chime.success` when the line/cell finishes successfully. Otherwise, `chime.error` is called whenever an exception is raised.## Exception notificationsIf you run `chime.notify_exceptions`, then `chime.error` will be called whenever an exception is raised.```pychime.notify_exceptions()raise ValueError(&quot;I'm going to make some noise&quot;)```## Command-line usageYou can run `chime` from the command-line:```sh$ chime```By default, this will play the success sound. You can also choose which sound to play, like so:```sh$ chime info```You can also choose which theme to use:```sh$ chime info --theme zelda```If you're using bash, then you can use `chime` to notify you when a program finishes:```sh$ echo &quot;Hello world!&quot;; chime```This will play the sound regardless of the fact that the first command succeeded or not. If you're running on Windows, then you can run the following equivalent:```sh&gt; echo &quot;Hello world!&quot; &amp; chime```## Platform supportUnder the hood, `chime` runs a command in the shell to play a `.wav` file. The command-line program that is used depends on the [platform](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Computing_platform) that you're using. Platform information is available in the [`sys.platform` variable](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.platform) as well as the [`platform` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/platform.html) from the standard library. Currently, the supported platforms are:- Darwin- Linux- WindowsA `UserWarning` is raised if you run a `chime` sound on an unsupported platform. Feel free to get in touch or issue a pull request if you want to add support for a specific platform. Likewise, don't hesitate if you're encountering trouble with one of the above platforms. I won't bite.## I can't hear anything 🙉Did you check if you turned your sound on? Just kidding. 😜This library is designed to be non-invasive. By default, sounds are played asynchronously in unchecked processes. Therefore, if something goes wrong, the process dies silently. If you can't hear anything and you think that the issue is coming from `chime`, then set the `sync` parameter when you play a sound:```py&gt;&gt;&gt; chime.info(sync=True)```This will play the sound synchronously and issue a warning if something goes wrong, which should allow you to debug the issue. You can also raise an exception instead of sending a warning by setting the `raise_error` parameter:```py&gt;&gt;&gt; chime.info(sync=True, raise_error=True)```Note that setting `raise_error` won't do anything if `sync` is set to `False`.## Setting a default themeTo change the default theme a configuration file may be created in `~/.config/chime/chime.conf` on Unix or `%APPDATA%\chime\chime.ini` on Windows.For example, to change the default theme to `'zelda'`, the configuration file would contain:```ini[chime]theme = zelda```## Command-line argumentsChime works by running commands in the CLI. For instance, `aplay` is used on Linux systems, while `afplay` is used on Darwin systems. Arguments can be specified by setting the `RUN_ARGS` variable. For example, here's how to select a specific sound card, assuming a Linux system using `aplay`:```py&gt;&gt;&gt; chime.RUN_ARGS = &quot;--device sysdefault:CARD=PCH&quot;```You can also specify this as a default configuration in the configuration file:```ini[chime]cli_args = '--device sysdefault:CARD=PCH'```At present, it isn't possible to pass CLI arguments on Windows, due to a limitation of the [`winsound`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/winsound.html) module.## Adding a new themeI have toyed with the idea of allowing users to add their own theme(s), but at the moment I rather keep things minimal. However, I'm happy to integrate new themes into the library. You can propose a new theme by [opening a pull request](https://github.com/MaxHalford/chime/issues/new) that adds the necessary .wav files to the [`themes` directory](https://github.com/MaxHalford/chime/tree/main/themes). A theme is made up of four files: `success.wav`, `warning.wav`, `error.wav`, and `info.wav`. That's all you need to do: the theme will picked up be automatically once the necessary files are provided.Be creative! 👩🎨## Things to do- Some mechanism to automatically call `chime.warning` when a warning occurs.- Make it work with a remote machine. For instance a Jupyter Notebook hosted on a remote machine.- More themes!## Acknowledgements- Special thanks to [Michael Vlah](https://github.com/vlahm) for being a gentleman by giving up the &quot;chime&quot; name on PyPI.- Thanks to u/Pajke on reddit for helping me debug Windows support.- Thanks to [David Chen](https://github.com/dchen327) for adding Linux support by suggesting the use of [aplay](https://linux.die.net/man/1/aplay).- Thanks to [Vincent Warmerdam](https://twitter.com/fishnets88) for suggesting a command-line interface.- Calmcode made a [video introduction to chime](https://calmcode.io/chime/introduction.html) ❤️- Thanks to [Paulo S.

Discord Notify is a plugin for Alliance Auth. If you don't have Alliance Auth running already, please install it first before proceeding. (see the official [AA installation guide](https://allianceauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/auth/allianceauth/) for details)1. Discord Notify needs [Discord Proxy](https://gitlab.com/ErikKalkoken/discordproxy) to function. Please make sure the server is up and running on your system, before continuing.1. Please also make sure you have the Discord service installed and setup in Alliance Auth.### Step 2 - Install appMake sure you are in the virtual environment (venv) of your Alliance Auth installation. Then install the newest release from PyPI:```bashpip install aa-discordnotify```### Step 3 - Configure Auth settingsConfigure your Auth settings (`local.py`) as follows:- Add `&quot;discordnotify&quot;` to `INSTALLED_APPS`- Optional: Add additional settings if you want to change any defaults. See [Settings](#settings) for the full list.### Step 4 - Finalize App installationRestart your supervisor services for Auth (no migration required).### Step 5 - Send test notificationTo test that your installation was successful you can create a test notification to yourself by navigating to the relative route `/discordnotify/test` in your browser. The absolute URL depends on your Auth site. Example: For an Auth site with the URL `https://auth.example.com` the test URL would be:```texthttps://auth.example.com/discordnotify/test```When everything was setup correctly, you will receive a test notification on Discord.Congratulations you are now ready to use Discord Notify!## SettingsHere is a list of available settings for this app. They can be configured by adding them to your AA settings file (`local.py`).Note that all settings are optional and the app will use the documented default settings if they are not used.Name | Description | Default-- | -- | --`DISCORDNOTIFY_ENABLED`| Set this to False to disable this app temporarily | `True``DISCORDNOTIFY_DISCORDPROXY_PORT`| Port used to communicate with Discord Proxy. | `50051``DISCORDNOTIFY_MARK_AS_VIEWED`| When enabled will mark all notifications as viewed that have been successfully submitted to Discord | `False``DISCORDNOTIFY_SUPERUSER_ONLY`| When enabled only superusers will be get their notifications forwarded. | `False`</longdescription>

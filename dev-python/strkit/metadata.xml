PacBio provides a [recommended workflow](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/apps-scripts/tree/master/RepeatAnalysisTools)for CCS alignment in this scenario.If you're using HiFi reads as input, **use the `--hq` and `--realign` options** to get better genotype calculation and a greater proportion of reads incorporated into the computed genotypes, respectively. These should not add much performance overhead.If more than one read file is specified, the reads will be pooled. This can come in handy if youhave e.g. multiple flow cells of the same sample split into different BAM files, or the reads aresplit by chromosome.If you want to incorporate SNV calling into the process, which speeds up runtime and givesmarginally better calling results, you must provide an indexed, `bgzip`-compressed SNV catalog VCF which matches your reference genome. You can find dbSNP VCFs at[`https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/organisms/human_9606/VCF/`](https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/organisms/human_9606/VCF/).The file for GRCh38 is called `00-common_all.vcf.gz` as of time of writing.If you want to output a full call report, you can use the `--json output-file.json` argument tospecify a path to output a more detailed JSON document to. This document contains 99% CIs, peaklabels, and some other information that isn't included in the normal TSV file. If you want thisfile to be indented and human-readable, use the `--indent-json` flag in addition to `--json ...`.See the '[Caller catalog format &amp; choosing a catalog](./docs/caller_catalog.md)' page for more onhow to format a locus catalog or choose from existing available catalogs.Note that the reference genome must be BGZipped and indexed using `samtools faidx`:```bash# Starting from a .fa:bgzip my-reference.fa  # Replaces .fa with a .fa.gz filesamtools faidx my-reference.fa.gz  # Generates a .fai index file```##### Note on OpenMP ThreadingSlow performance can result from running `strkit call` on a system with OpenMP, due to a misguided  attempt at multithreading under the hood somewhere in Numpy/Scipy (which doesn't work here due to  repeated initializations of the Gaussian mixture model.) To fix this, the followingenvironment variable is auto-set (hardcoded) before running:```bashexport OMP_NUM_THREADS=1```If this hard-coded value interferes with your use case, please open an issue.#### Further documentation on the STRkit caller:  * [Advanced caller usage and configuration](./docs/caller_usage.md)  * [Caller catalog format &amp; choosing a catalog](./docs/caller_catalog.md)### `strkit visualize`: Call visualizerSTRkit bundles a call visualization tool which takes as input a BAM file anda JSON call file from using the `--json` flag with `strkit call`.It starts a web server on your local machine; the visualizations can be interacted with in a web browser.To use the tool, run the following command:```bashstrkit visualize path/to/my-alignment.bam \   --ref hg38 \  # or hg19  --json path/to/my-calls.json \  -i 1  # 1-indexed offset in JSON file for locus of interest. Default is 1 if left out.```This will output something like the following:``` * Serving Flask app 'strkit.viz.server' (lazy loading) * Environment: production   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.   Use a production WSGI server instead. * Debug mode: on * Running on http://localhost:5011 (Press CTRL+C to quit)...```You can then go to the URL listed, `http://localhost:5011`, on your local machineto see the visualization tool:![Browser Histogram](./docs/images/browser_hist.png)*STRkit browser histogram, showing an expansion in the HTT gene.*![igv.js Genome Browser](./docs/images/browser_igv.png)*The same expansion, shown in the igv.js browser. Note the insertions onthe left-hand side in most reads, and the heterozygous copy number pattern.*To exit the tool, press `Ctrl-C` in your command line window as mentioned in the start-up instructions.### `strkit mi`: Mendelian inheritance analysisUsing trio data, candidate de novo STR mutations (or genotyping errors/dropout rates) can be discovered by looking at inheritance patterns. This tool provides a few different ways to do this, via:* Mendelian inheritance % (MI) calculations for many common TR genotyping tools for both long/short reads,   including support for genotyping methods which report confidence intervals.* Reports of loci (potentially of interest) which do not respect MI* An optional test flag to detect de novo events and assign a p-value in trio JSON reports generated by   `strkit call`. Note that **this currently will over-report significance with low coverage** as tested with the   `x2` chi-squared test option.**For more information on what kind of analyses can be done with this data**, see the[Trio analyses with STRkit](./docs/trio_analyses.md) page.</longdescription>

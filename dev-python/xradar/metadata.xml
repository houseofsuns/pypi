So the idea of a common software project whose only task is to read and write radar data was born. The data import should include as many available data formats as possible, but the data export should be limited to the recognized standards, such as [ODIM_H5](https://www.eumetnet.eu/activities/observations-programme/current-activities/opera/) and [CfRadial](https://github.com/NCAR/CfRadial).As memory representation an xarray based data model was chosen, which is internally adapted to the forthcoming standard CfRadial2.1/FM301. FM301 is enforced by the [Joint Expert Team on Operational Weather Radar (JET-OWR)](https://community.wmo.int/governance/commission-membership/commission-observation-infrastructure-and-information-systems-infcom/commission-infrastructure-officers/infcom-management-group/standing-committee-measurements-instrumentation-and-traceability-sc-mint/joint-expert-team). Information on FM301 is available at WMO as [WMO CF Extensions](https://community.wmo.int/activity-areas/wis/wmo-cf-extensions).Any software package that uses xarray in any way will then be able to directly use the described data model and thus quickly and easily import and export radar data. Another advantage is the easy connection to already existing [open source radar processing software](https://openradarscience.org/pages/projects/#).## StatusXradar is considered stable for the implemented readers and writers which have been ported from wradlib. It will remain in beta status until the standard is finalized and the API as well as data model will move into stable/production status.## Features* Import CfRadial1 data* Import/Export CfRadial2 data* Import/Export ODIM_H5 data* Import GAMIC HDF5* Import Rainbow5* Import Iris/Sigmet* Import Furuno SCN/SCNX* Georeferencing (AEQD)* Angle Reindexing# History## 0.2.0 (2023-03-24)* ENH: switch to add optional how attributes in ODIM format writer ({pull}`97`) by [@egouden](https://github.com/egouden)* FIX: add keyword argument for mandatory source attribute in ODIM format writer ({pull}`96`) by [@egouden](https://github.com/egouden)* FIX: check for dim0 if not given, only swap_dims if needed ({issue}`92`), ({pull}`94`) by [@kmuehlbauer](https://github.com/kmuehlbauer)* FIX+ENH: need array copy before overwriting and make compression available in to_odim ({pull}`95`) by [@kmuehlbauer](https://github.com/kmuehlbauer)## 0.1.0 (2023-02-23)* Add an example on reading multiple sweeps into a single object ({pull}`69`) by [@mgrover1](https://github.com/mgrover1)* ENH: add spatial_ref with pyproj when georeferencing, add/adapt methods/tests ({issue}`38`), ({pull}`87`) by [@kmuehlbauer](https://github.com/kmuehlbauer)* Docs/docstring updates, PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md ({pull}`89`) by [@kmuehlbauer](https://github.com/kmuehlbauer)* Finalize release 0.1.0, add testpypi upload on push to main ({pull}`91`) by [@kmuehlbauer](https://github.com/kmuehlbauer)## 0.0.13 (2023-02-09)* FIX: only skip setting cf-attributes if both gain and offset are unused ({pull}`85`) by [@kmuehlbauer](https://github.com/kmuehlbauer)## 0.0.12 (2023-02-09)* ENH: add IRIS ``DB_VELC`` decoding and tests ({issue}`78`), ({pull}`83`) by [@kmuehlbauer](https://github.com/kmuehlbauer)* FIX: furuno backend inconsistencies ({issue}`77`), ({pull}`82`) by [@kmuehlbauer](https://github.com/kmuehlbauer)* FIX: ODIM_H5 backend inconsistencies ({issue}`80`), ({pull}`81`) by [@kmuehlbauer](https://github.com/kmuehlbauer)## 0.0.11 (2023-02-06)* fix ``_Undetect``/``_FillValue`` in odim writer ({pull}`71`) by [@kmuehlbauer](https://github.com/kmuehlbauer)* port more backend tests from wradlib ({pull}`73`) by [@kmuehlbauer](https://github.com/kmuehlbauer)## 0.0.10 (2023-02-01)* add WRN110 scn format to Furuno reader ({pull}`65`) by [@kmuehlbauer](https://github.com/kmuehlbauer)* Adapt to new build process, pyproject.toml only, use `ruff` for linting ({pull}`67`) by [@kmuehlbauer](https://github.com/kmuehlbauer)## 0.0.9 (2022-12-11)* add ODIM_H5 exporter ({pull}`39`) by [@kmuehlbauer](https://github.com/kmuehlbauer)* fetch radar data from open-radar-data ({pull}`44`) by [@kmuehlbauer](https://github.com/kmuehlbauer)* align readers with CfRadial2, add CfRadial2 exporter ({pull}`45`), ({pull}`49`), ({pull}`53`), ({pull}`56`), ({pull}`57`) and ({pull}`58`) by [@kmuehlbauer](https://github.com/kmuehlbauer)* add georeference accessor, update examples ({pull}`60`), ({pull}`61`) by [@mgrover1](https://github.com/mgrover1)* refactored and partly reimplemented angle reindexing ({issue}`55`), ({pull}`62`) by [@kmuehlbauer](https://github.com/kmuehlbauer)## 0.0.8 (2022-09-28)* add GAMIC HDF5 importer ({pull}`29`) by [@kmuehlbauer](https://github.com/kmuehlbauer)* add Furuno SCN/SCNX importer ({pull}`30`) by [@kmuehlbauer](https://github.com/kmuehlbauer)* add Rainbow5 importer ({pull}`32`) by [@kmuehlbauer](https://github.com/kmuehlbauer)* add Iris/Sigmet importer ({pull}`33`) by [@kmuehlbauer](https://github.com/kmuehlbauer)* add georeferencing (AEQD) ({pull}`28`) by [@mgrover1](https://github.com/mgrover1)## 0.0.7 (2022-09-21)* Add zenodo badges to README.md ({pull}`22`) by [@mgrover1](https://github.com/mgrover1)* Fix version on RTD ({pull}`23`) by [@kmuehlbauer](https://github.com/kmuehlbauer)* Add minimal documentation for Datamodel ({pull}`24`) by [@kmuehlbauer](https://github.com/kmuehlbauer)## 0.0.6 (2022-09-19)* Improve installation and contribution guide, update README.md with more badges, add version and date of release to docs, update install process ({pull}`19`) by [@kmuehlbauer](https://github.com/kmuehlbauer)* Add minimal documentation for CfRadial1 and ODIM_H5 importers ({pull}`20`) by [@kmuehlbauer](https://github.com/kmuehlbauer)* Add accessors.py submodule, add accessors showcase  ({pull}`21`) by [@kmuehlbauer](https://github.com/kmuehlbauer)## 0.0.5 (2022-09-14)* Data Model, CfRadial1 Backend ({pull}`13`) by [@kmuehlbauer](https://github.com/kmuehlbauer)* ODIM_H5 Backend ({pull}`14`) by [@kmuehlbauer](https://github.com/kmuehlbauer)## 0.0.4 (2022-09-01)Setting up CI workflow and build, [@mgrover1](https://github.com/mgrover1) and [@kmuehlbauer](https://github.com/kmuehlbauer)## 0.0.1 (2022-09-01)* First release on PyPI.</longdescription>

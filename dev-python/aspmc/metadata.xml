	<longdescription># aspmc(Algebraic) answer set counter based on a treewidth-aware cycle-breaking for normal answer set programs.For usage on Linux you may also install this software as a pip package via```pip install aspmc```Documentation for usage as a python module is available [here](https://raki123.github.io/aspmc/). Examples for command line usage are available below.If you have any issues please contact us, or even better create an issue on GitHub.For academic usage cite  * Eiter, T., Hecher, M., &amp; Kiesel, R. (2021, September). Treewidth-Aware Cycle Breaking for Algebraic Answer Set Counting. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (Vol. 18, No. 1, pp. 269-279).## Development setupFor developement clone via ```git clone --single-branch --branch=main git@github.com:raki123/aspmc.git```to avoid the download of the experimental results in branch `results`.We include a setup bash script `setup.sh` that should automatically perform all steps below that are required to run our code. (Except for providing the c2d and miniC2D binary.)### Python* Python &gt;= 3.6All required modules are listed in `requirements.txt` and can be obtained by running```pip install -r requirements.txt```### Tree Decompositions via flow-cutterWe use [flow-cutter](https://github.com/kit-algo/flow-cutter-pace17) to obtain treedecompositions that are needed for our treedecomposition guided clark completion, obtaining treewidth upperbounds on the programs, variable order generation and more.It is included as a git submodule.The submodules can be obtained by running```git submodule update --init```flow-cutter further needs to be compiled via```cd aspmc/external/flow-cutter/bash build.sh```### Knowledge Compilation via d4 or sharpSAT-TD We use [d4](https://github.com/raki123/d4) or [sharpSAT-TD](https://github.com/raki123/sharpsat-td) for knowledge compilation. Note that both of these are forks of the original model counters [here](https://github.com/crillab/d4) and [here](https://github.com/Laakeri/sharpsat-td/), respectively. For d4 we added support for smooth compilation and for sharpSAT-TD we used the nicely thought out addition by Tuukka Korhonen and Matti Järvisalo to enable weighted model counting over semirings in that we added a custom semiring to compile an sd-DNNF.Both are also included as a git submodules.The submodules can be obtained by running```git submodule update --init```They can then be compiled via ```cd aspmc/external/sharpsat-td/mkdir binbash setupdev.shcd ../../../cd aspmc/external/d4/make -j4cd ../../../```## Optionally: c2d and miniC2DWe also are able to use c2d to obtain d-DNNF representations. The c2d binary can be provided under `aspmc/external/c2d/bin/` as `c2d_linux` and can be downloaded from [here](http://reasoning.cs.ucla.edu/c2d/).The miniC2D binary (and the hgr2htree binary) can be provided under `aspmc/external/miniC2D/bin/linux/` as `miniC2D` (and `hgr2htree`) and can be downloaded from [here](http://reasoning.cs.ucla.edu/minic2d/).Note that they are only available for research use.## UsageThe basic usage is```python main.py [-m .] [-c] [-s .] [-n] [-t] [-ds .] [-dt .] [-k .] [-g .] [-h] [&lt;INPUT-FILES&gt;]    --mode          -m  MODE        set input mode to MODE:                                    * asp           : take a normal answer set program as input                                    * problog       : take a problog program as input                                    * smproblog     : take a problog program with negations as input                                    * meuproblog    : take a problog program with extra decision and utility atoms as input                                    * mapproblog    : take a problog program with extra evidence and map query atoms as input    --count         -c              not only output the equivalent cnf as out.cnf but also performs (algebraic) counting of the answer sets    --semiring      -s  SEMIRING    use the semiring specified in the python file aspmc/semirings/SEMIRING.py                                    only useful with -m problog    --no_pp         -n              does not perform cycle breaking and outputs a normalized version of the input program as `out.lp`                                    the result is equivalent, ground and does not contain annotated disjunctions.    --treewidth     -t              print the treewidth of the resulting CNF    --decos         -ds SOLVER      set the solver that computes tree decompositions to SOLVER:                                    * flow-cutter   : uses flow_cutter_pace17 (default)    --decot         -dt SECONDS     set the timeout for computing tree decompositions to SECONDS (default: 1)    --knowlege      -k  COMPILER    set the knowledge compiler to COMPILER:                                    * sharpsat-td   : uses a compilation version of sharpsat-td (default)                                    * d4            : uses the (slightly modified) d4 compiler.                                     * c2d           : uses the c2d compiler.                                     * miniC2D       : uses the miniC2D compiler.     --guide_clark   -g  GUIDE       set the tree decomposition type to use to guide the clark completion to GUIDE:                                    * none          : preform the normal clark completion without guidance                                    * ors           : guide for or nodes only                                     * both          : guide for both `and` and `or` nodes (default)    --help          -h              print this help and exit```### ExamplesThese examples are for when the code is downloaded via GitHub.When using the pip package replace `python main.py` by `aspmc` to obtain the same result.#### ASP example:```python main.py -m asp -c -f a :- not b.b :- not a.```Reads the program from stdin and counts its models.```python main.py -m asp -c -f test/test_cycle.lp```Reads the same program from file and counts its models.#### problog example```python main.py -m problog -c -f0.5::a.b :- a.query(b).```Evaluates the given simple program over the probability semiring.```python main.py -m problog -c -s maxplus -f0.5::a.b :- a.query(b).```Evaluates the given simple program over the MaxPlus semiring.</longdescription>

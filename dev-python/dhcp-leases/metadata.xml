	<longdescription>python-dhcp-leases======================|Build Status| |PyPI version| |CodeFactor| |Coverage Status|Small python module for reading /var/lib/dhcp/dhcpd.leases fromisc-dhcp-server. This module works in Python 2.7 and 3.xThis module also supports reading lease files from the isc dhcp daemonrunning in IPv6 mode (Since version 0.4.0).Installation------------Through pypi~~~~~~~~~~~~.. code:: bash    $ sudo pip install dhcp-leasesThrough git~~~~~~~~~~~.. code:: bash    $ git clone git@github.com:acikogun/python-dhcp-leases.git    $ cd python-dhcp-leases    $ python setup.py build    $ sudo python setup.py installUsage-----.. code:: python    from dhcp_leases import DhcpLeases    leases = DhcpLeases('/path/to/dhcpd.leases')    leases.get()  # Returns the leases as a list of Lease objects    leases.get_current()  # Returns only the currently valid dhcp leases as dict                          # The key of the dict is the device mac address and the                          # Value is a Lease objectOr read a gzip'ed file:.. code:: python    from dhcp_leases import DhcpLeases    # DhcpLeases(filename, gzip=False)    leases = DhcpLeases('/path/to/dhcpd.leases', True) # True param starts the gzip reader    leases.get()  # Returns the leases as a list of Lease objects    leases.get_current()  # Returns only the currently valid dhcp leases as dict                          # The key of the dict is the device mac address and the                          # Value is a Lease objectThe Lease object has the following fields (only for IPv4 leases):.. code:: python    lease instanceof Lease    lease.ip             # The ip address assigned by this lease as string    lease.ethernet       # The mac address of the lease    lease.hardware       # The OSI physical layer used to request the lease (usually ethernet)    lease.start          # The start time of this lease as DateTime object    lease.end            # The time this lease expires as DateTime object or None if this is an infinite lease    lease.hostname       # The hostname for this lease if given by the client    lease.binding_state  # The binding state as string ('active', 'free', 'abandoned', 'backup')    lease.data           # Dict of all the info in the dhcpd.leases file for this lease    lease.valid          # True if the lease hasn't expired and is not in the future    lease.active         # True if the binding state is active    lease.options        # List of extra options in the lease file    lease.sets           # List of the 'set' items in the lease fileThe Lease6 object has the following fields (only for IPv6):.. code:: python    lease instanceof Lease6    lease.ip                 # The ip address assigned by this lease as string    lease.type               # If this is a temporary or permanent address.

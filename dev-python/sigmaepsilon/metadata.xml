Come back later, or star the repo to make sure you don’t miss the first stable release!## HighlightsHead over to the Quick Examples page in the docs to explore our gallery of examples showcasing what SigmaEpsilon can do! Want to test-drive SigmaEpsilon? All of the examples from the gallery are live on MyBinder for you to test drive without installing anything locally: Launch on Binder.### Overview* A `solid` submodule to analyze and optimize solid structures of all kinds with the **Finite Element Method**. The implementations so far only cover linear behaviour, but with practically no limits on the complexity of the shape and topology of the domain under investigation.## InstallationThis is optional, but we suggest you to create a dedicated virtual enviroment at all times to avoid conflicts with your other projects. Create a folder, open a command shell in that folder and use the following command```console&gt;&gt;&gt; python -m venv venv_name```Once the enviroment is created, activate it via typing```console&gt;&gt;&gt; .\venv_name\Scripts\activate````sigmaepsilon` can be installed (either in a virtual enviroment or globally) from PyPI using `pip` on Python &gt;= 3.6:```console&gt;&gt;&gt; pip install sigmaepsilon```## **Documentation**Refer to the [docs](https://sigmaepsilon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for further details on installation and usage.## **Testing**To run all tests, open up a console in the root directory of the project and type the following```console&gt;&gt;&gt; python -m unittest```## **Dependencies**We use Numba's JIT compiler to speed up heavy computations, and it relies on the C++ redistributable package. It is likely already installed on your system, but if it is not, you can download it from Microsoft's website under &quot;Other Tools, Frameworks, and Redistributables&quot;.must have* `Numba`, `NumPy`, `SciPy`, `SymPy`, `awkward`strongly suggested* `PyVista`, `Plotly`, `matplotlib`, `sectionproperties`optional* `networkx`## **License**SigmaEpsilon is Copyright(C) 2022: Bence BaloghAll rights reserved.This program is dual-licensed as follows:(1) You may use SigmaEpsilon as free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.In this case the program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Please adhere to the following requirements in your change:- Code should be compliant with [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)- Full overage by unit tests- All classes should be immutable- All classes and their public methods must have docstring documentation- All changes must be documented in the Change Log</longdescription>

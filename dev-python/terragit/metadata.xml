install python-gitlab``#### Installation``pip install terragit``#### Start-up #### terragit configbefore using any of the bellow commands you will need to run terragit config command to initialise terragit:\you will be asked to enter the following information : gitlab_token : gitlab token allows you to access remotely to your gitlab account\keybase : terragit use keybase mainly to decrypt IAM credentials\gitlab_user : your gitlab usernameafter running terragit config successfully it will create a file called ./terragit in your home directory\after that you can run the commands bellow##### terragit {switch}.Allows you to switch between groups/project present in .terragit file and use the project/group information \when executing some terragit commands like terragit plan or apply in this case the command is going to use IAM account credentials \.Creates a ~/.terragit_profile file with  corresponding environment variables{-g} {--group_id} : group/project id of the group/project that you want to switch to{-gn} {--group_name} : group/project name of the group/project that you want to switch to.Please run source ~/.terragit_profile when success.Add aws profiles to ~/.aws/credentials file (you should have aws-cli installed)##### terragit {compare}Allows you to compare two infrastructures by giving source and destination local tf states in json format.\.Creates terragit-compare folder, where you can see:\    State_list.csv file: comparison between 2 infrastructure different states \S_list{State_name}.csv: Detailed properties' comparison of each common state \{-I}: local path for source infra \{-N}: local path for destination infra##### terragit {validate}Allows you to validate a terraform module by giving the local path or project id and path of the targetfolder from content root \ {-p}: local path \{-P}: path of the target folder from content root in case of remote project \{-prId}: git/gitlab  project id ##### terragit {plan|validate|changes|apply|output}you must switch to a project before using this command if you intend to use it with AWS services  \in order to get IAM credentials from .terragit file {-d} {--destroy}: to indicate if it is destroy  make plan a plan destroy and make apply a destroy\{-c} {--commit_id}: commit id\{-mrid} { --mr_id}: merge id\{-dir} {--directory}: directory\{-p} {--project_id}: project id\{-v} {-verbose}: to indicate if output will exit on the console  and in log folder too\##### terragit {docs}{-p} {--project_id}: project id\{-m} {--module} : for docs module\{-l} {--live} : for live infra\{-o} {--output} : output path : default {&quot;./&quot;}\##### terragit {clone}Allows you to clone a project or the entire projects of a specific group(projects of subgroups included),\check if you have an aws account, and if you have one, this feature is going to decrypt your credentials\and add group information to .terragit file{-g} {--group_id}: provide group id if you want to clone a group, if not, don't use this argument\{-p} {--project_id}: provide project id if you want to clone a project, if not, don't use this argument\{-ip} {--infra_project_id}: your infrastructure project id in case you are cloning a group to check if you have \{--path}: the path to clone the project in \##### terragit {adduser}Using this command, you can add a user to a gitlab group or project and create an AWS account for him.\first this command is going to check if a user exists or not in gitlab group or project.Then based \on the search result it will either add user to repository, create AWS account for the user or do both.{-g} {--group_id}: provide group id if you want to add user to a group, if not, don't use this argument\{-p} {--project_id}: provide project id if you want to add user to a project, if not, don't use this argument\{-ip} {--gitlab_username}: gitlab username of the user you want to add \{-lvl} {--access_level} : access level of the user you want to add, possible values (guest, reporter, developer, maintainer or owner)\##### terragit {clean}Allows you to delete old merge requests, branches or both of a project or group.{-g} {--group_id}: provide group id if you want to clean a group. if not, don't use this argument\{-p} {--project_id}: provide project id if you want to clean a project. if not, don't use this argument\{-t} {--time}: provide time(number of days) to delete branches/merge-requests older then time provided \Example :if you provide 10 it will delete all branches/merge-requests older then 10 days. \provide 0 if you want to delete all branches/merge-requests\{-mr} {--mr}: set it to true if you want to delete Merge requests else false \{-b} {--branches}: set it to true if you want to delete branches else false \##### terragit {list}list projects/groups in .terragit file ##### terragit {currentProject}get selected project/group (you can select project/group using terragit switch command)  ##### terragit {status}this command executes terragit status on all git projects inside a given directory{-dir} {--directory}: directory\##### terragit {project-list}Allows you to list all groups in clients-acp group and clone the entire projects of a specific group{-dir} {--directory}: directory where to make the clone \</longdescription>

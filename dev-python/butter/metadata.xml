	<longdescription>======== Butter========&quot;Making things that little bit butter under linux&quot;Butter is a library to integrate some of Linux's low level features into pythoneg signalfd, eventfd and timerfd. most of these functions are handy if you are looking into creating non-blocking servers, dealing with event loops or writinghigh performance servicesFeatures--------- * Full testing of all error conditions in unit tests * Small set of exceptions to deal with * asyncio compatible versions of calls * Emulation and reuse of built in objects wherever possible * Both low level 1:1 calls and a high level interface available * Default values chosen follow 'least surprise' principle (eg CLOCK_MONOTONIC   instead of CLOCK_REALTIME to avoid issues with clock updates) * Single codebase supporting python 2 and python 3 without modifcation for    easier forward migrationWhats Available---------------- * inotify (Complete support, includes asyncio support) * fanotify (Limited support, includes asyncio support) * splice * tee * vmsplice (Removed, cant be done safely with Python, use os.writev instead) * gethostname * sethostname * mount * umount * pivot_root * getpid (bypasses glibc caching) * getppid (bypasses glibc caching) * eventfd (includes asyncio support) * timerfd (includes asyncio support) * 'sloppy' timers (inaccurate timers that may experince jitter for power saving) * Wake timers (timers that may wake a system from suspend) * pthread_sigmask (Avalible in python3.x but backported for python2.7) * signalfd (includes asyncio support) * memfd * prctlWhats Coming-------------Most of these exist in v0.2 as ctypes code. these are currently being rewrittento use cffi for speed and compatibility with pypy * posix/linux aio (scatter/gather read writes with a completion based API    instead of a 'ready' based interface, eg similar to IOCP on windows) * Sphinx documentation * Example code * More unit testsSupported Python-----------------Butter currently supported the following python interpreters* pypy (2.7 and 3.2 python implementations)* cpython 3.4 (required for asyncio support)* cpython 3.x* cpython 2.7Butter may work on older versions however it has not been tested on anything except the above interpreters and may break without warningInstalling-----------butter makes use of several C libraries to provide low level functionality. mostof the compilation is taken care of by setup.py and cffi at install time however you will need to ensure that some header files are available on the machine doing the compilation (which may be different to the machine butter is being packaged for and Finally installed on)Dev packages required: * kernel headers for a fairly recent kernel (3.x recommended) * libffi-dev (required for cffi) to install butter use the following command:    $ pip install setuptools     $ pip install butterthis will pull in all the required dependencies and compile the required C extensionsfor asyncio support, python 3.4 or newer is required. importing the asyncio modules on older versions of python will throw a syntax error. Hence why theseare namespaced under butter.asyncio rather than in the base modulesDesign-------The 'fd' apis have been designed first as thin wrappers around the underlyingkernel syscalls. A File-like object that then uses these syscalls is then made available that obeys the 'event like' interface and is based on the interfaceprovided by File and friends. They are intended to be drop in replacements and be used with the select moduleEvent-like objects+++++++++++++++++++Event like objects are identical to filelike objects except they have the following extra methods to replace the disabled read/readline/write/writelinefunctionality * read_event:  Return a single event * read_events: Return all cached events OR read all events from the kernelAsyncIO++++++++Some syscalls (ones that deal with fd's) have been made to work with the asyncio framework that became avalible in python3.4. The asyncio enabledobject is named after the normal Event-like object equivlent with '_async'after it, eg Inotify =&gt; Inotify_async. These asyncio Eventlike objects aredesigned to act and behave like the asyncio.Queue object without the abilityto write events to the queue (ie they can only be read from and events areinjected from the fd as required)Exceptions+++++++++++Butter was designed to have a small set of easily catchable exceptions and to reuse the builtin exceptions wherever possible. The list below is a roughguide of what exceptions you can expect to receive * OSError/MemoryError: The Operating system was unable to fulfill your request * ValueError: One of the arguments is invalid * PermissionError: You do not have sufficient Privileges to use this call * InternalError: The function hit an internal bug that was never expected to   be hit but is tested for just in case. Please consider filing a bug report * UnknownError: The Error is not specifically handled and unexpected, see    exception.errno for the Error code that generated this exceptionProjects using Butter---------------------- * https://pypi.python.org/pypi/icheck/ (Written by the author, inotify) * https://pypi.python.org/pypi/igor-inotify/ (Written by the author, inotify)Contact Details---------------- * For pull requests, patches, feature requests and support   please email the author (code@pocketnix.org) * xmpp: dablitz@pocketnix.org or code@conference.pocketnix.org.. :changelog: Release History----------------0.13.1 (2021-06-12)++++++++++++++++++++- Bump versions correctly0.13.0 (2021-06-12)++++++++++++++++++++- Arguments that take a file name or object now accept Path objects- Fixups to setup.py- Add new prctl module0.12.6 (2017-06-07)++++++++++++++++++++- Eventlike objects are now usable as context managers like files- 'pytest' now works corectly (with no args)- Fixed up missing symbols in fanotify module- reworked test suite to acomidate python2.70.12.5 (2017-04-07)++++++++++++++++++++- Removal of seccomp support- Add FAN_MODIFY_DIR from latest linux release- Add FAN_ALL_EVENTS0.12.4 (2017-01-27)++++++++++++++++++++- Added environment variable to disable building of seccomp support- Fixed up issue with imports on splice and timerfd- Added memfd support- Fix up tests- Test suite now leaks less fd's- Added CLONE_NEWCGROUP- setns wrapper added (only low level stub was present)0.12.3 (2017-01-27)++++++++++++++++++++- Added contributor file to keep a record of those who helped out- fix up imports that where breaking on python3, preventing lib usage- Document a 3rd party lib dependency that comes in handy0.12.2 (2016-04-16)++++++++++++++++++++- Include missing build files0.12.1 (2015-05-02)++++++++++++++++++++- Added stub for removed vmsplice() that raises NotImplemented- Remove note about installing cffi first as it is no longer required since v0.120.12 (2015-04-02)++++++++++++++++++- Add support for new timer types including 'slack' timers and timers that can wake a system from suspend- Hid the clone.C class as clone._C as it is not intended for general consumption- Provided C implementation for pivot_root as it was not provided by glibc- Migrated to cffi &gt;= 1.0.0 to fix build bugs**API Changes**- Removed vmsplice() due to safety issues (does not copy bytes but maps live data, GC causes liveliness issues)0.11.2 (2015-09-27)++++++++++++++++++++- Document cffi bootstrap issues in README0.11.1 (2015-06-14)++++++++++++++++++++- Misc fixups to setup.py**API Changes**- Older Linux distros (debian &lt;

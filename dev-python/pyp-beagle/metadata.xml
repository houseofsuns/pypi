	<longdescription>[![Upload Python Package](https://github.com/jacopo-chevallard/PyP-BEAGLE/actions/workflows/python-publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jacopo-chevallard/PyP-BEAGLE/actions/workflows/python-publish.yml)# PyP-BEAGLEPyP-BEAGLE (**Py**thon **P**ostprocessing of **BEAGLE**) is a Python package to postprocess the analyses performed with the galaxy SED modelling tool [Beagle](http://www.jacopochevallard.org/beagle/) (**B**ay**E**sian **A**nalysis of **G**a**L**axy s**E**ds). PyP-BEAGLE allows one to create different types of publication-quality plots, LaTeX tables, as well as several higher level &quot;summary&quot; catalogues.  # Installing PyP-BEAGLE* Make sure that you have a (science-ready!) installation of Python 3.x (starting from PyP-BEAGLE version 0.7.0), for instance [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)* To install PyP-BEAGLE simply run  ```  pip install pyp_beagle  ```# Known issues* On a Mac OS, multiprocessing only works with the ``Agg`` backend. Make sure that your ``~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc`` file contains the line  ```  backend      : Agg  ```* If you encounter errors related to LaTeX, or if the visual appearance of the plots is not satisfying, you can copy the matplotlib configuration file ``script/matplotlibrc`` into your ``$HOME/.matplotlib/`` folder (if the folder does not exist, create it). If you already have a customized  ``matplotlibrc`` file, then you can use the GNU ``diff`` command to update it.* PyP-BEAGLE assumes that the Beagle environment variables are correctly set on your machine. Note that while these are the same environment variables used by Docker-Beagle (see [here](https://github.com/jacopo-chevallard/BEAGLE-general/wiki#running-beagle)), they have to point to the actual folders on your machine, not to the &quot;virtual&quot; folder that Docker-Beagle uses. To correctly set the environment variables, you can use the ``scripts/BEAGLE_env_variable.bash`` or ``scripts/BEAGLE_env_variable.csh`` files. In practice, after modifying the file to reflect your Beagle folder tree, you can simply add at the end of your ``.bashrc`` (or ``.tcshrc``, or equivalent) the line ```bash source &lt;full path to the file&gt;/BEAGLE_env_variable.bash ```# Using PyP-BEAGLEThe post-processing of Beagle results is performed by means of the command ``pyp_beagle``. Since PyP-BEAGLE is often updated, you can visualize the (entire) possible options via the PyP-BEAGLE ``help``, with the command```cshpyp_beagle --help```Below we report a few of some common PyP-BEAGLE use cases and related commands.* [triangle plots](#plotting-the-posterior-probability-distributions-aka-triangle-plots)* [marginal plots](#plotting-the-comparison-of-data-and-model-observables-aka-marginal-plots)* [summary catalogue](#computing-a-summary-catalogue)* [true vs retrieved parameters](#plotting-the-comparison-of-input-and-retrieved-parameters-when-fitting-mock-observations)### Plotting the posterior probability distributions (aka &quot;triangle plots&quot;)#### Command```cshpyp_beagle -r &lt;your Beagle results folder&gt; \--plot-triangle \[-np &lt;number of processors&gt;] \[--json-triangle &lt;JSON triangle file&gt;] \[--mock-catalogue &lt;input mock catalogue&gt;] \[--json-mock &lt;JSON mock file&gt;]```where* ``&lt;your Beagle results folder&gt;`` must be replaced by the full path to the Beagle output directory;* ``&lt;number of processors&gt;`` is an integer indicating how many processors can be used for the parallel execution of the script. This is particularly important when producing plots for large (&gt; 1000) samples, as the creation of each individual plot can take several tens of seconds.* ``&lt;JSON triangle file&gt;`` is a JSON file used for the configuration of the triangle plot (which parameters should be plotted, log scale, plot limits, ...), an example can be found [here](https://github.com/jacopo-chevallard/PyP-BEAGLE/blob/0996fd3c6b271e15452b7edee6627bc7fbc68675/PyP-BEAGLE/files/params_names.json);* ``&lt;input mock catalogue&gt;`` indicates a Beagle FITS file containing the input (i.e. &quot;true&quot;) physical parameters used to construct the noiseless SEDs which have then been fitted with Beagle (after the noise addition, which must be performed **outside** Beagle). Note that in this case, a ``&lt;JSON mock file&gt;`` must be passed, since we must instruct PyP-BEAGLE where (in which FITS extension and column) to find the &quot;true&quot; parameters. An example of the ``&lt;JSON mock file&gt;`` to be used in this case can be found [here](https://github.com/jacopo-chevallard/PyP-BEAGLE/blob/0996fd3c6b271e15452b7edee6627bc7fbc68675/PyP-BEAGLE/files/params_names_mock.json).#### OutputThe successful execution of the script will create a set of ``*_triangle.pdf`` files (one per object) in the ``&lt;your Beagle results folder&gt;/pyp-beagle/plot`` folder.### Plotting the comparison of data and model observables (aka &quot;marginal plots&quot;)#### Command```cshpyp_beagle -r &lt;your Beagle results folder&gt; \--plot-marginal \[-np &lt;number of processors&gt;] \[--log-wavelength] \[--plot-line-labels] \[--spectral-resolution &lt;resolution&gt;] \```where* ``&lt;your Beagle results folder&gt;`` must be replaced by the full path to the Beagle output directory;* ``&lt;number of processors&gt;`` is an integer indicating how many processors can be used for the parallel execution of the script. This is particularly important when producing plots for large (&gt; 1000) samples, as the creation of each individual plot can take several tens of seconds;* ``&lt;resolution&gt;`` is a float indicating the resolution of the spectra, and it is used to determine which emission line labels are printed on the plot.#### OutputThe successful execution of the script will create a set of ``*_marginal_SED_spec.pdf`` files (one per object) in the ``&lt;your Beagle results folder&gt;/pyp-beagle/plot`` folder.### Computing a summary catalogue#### Command```cshpyp_beagle -r &lt;your Beagle results folder&gt; --compute-summary[--json-summary &lt;JSON summary file&gt;]```where* ``&lt;your Beagle results folder&gt;`` must be replaced by the full path to the Beagle output directory;* ``&lt;JSON summary file&gt;`` is a JSON file used for the configuration of the summary catalogue, specifying for which parameters the summary statistics (posterior mean and median, 68 and 95 % credible regions) should be computed. An example can be found [here](https://github.com/jacopo-chevallard/PyP-BEAGLE/blob/0996fd3c6b271e15452b7edee6627bc7fbc68675/PyP-BEAGLE/files/summary_config.json).#### OutputThe successful execution of the script will create the file ``&lt;your Beagle results folder&gt;/pyp-beagle/data/BEAGLE_summary_catalogue.fits``.#### DescriptionIn the ``POSTERIOR PDF`` extension we have added some quantities related to the MAP = Maximum-a-Posteriori solution, namely the probability (``MAP_probability``), log-likelihood (``MAP_ln_likelihood``), chi-square (``MAP_chi_square``), and number of data points used in the fitting (``MAP_n_data``). These quantities enable a quick &quot;frequentist-like&quot; check of the goodness-of-the-fit of the MAP solution.The physical parameters corresponding to the MAP solution are indicated as ``&lt;parameter_name&gt;_MAP`` (e.g. ``mass_MAP``).### Plotting the comparison of input and retrieved parameters when fitting mock observations#### Command```cshpyp_beagle -r &lt;your Beagle results folder&gt; --mock-catalogue &lt;input mock catalogue&gt; \--json-mock &lt;JSON mock file&gt;```where* ``&lt;your Beagle results folder&gt;`` must be replaced by the full path to the Beagle output directory;* ``&lt;input mock catalogue&gt;`` indicates a Beagle FITS file containing the input (i.e. &quot;true&quot;) physical parameters used to construct the noiseless SEDs which have then been fitted with Beagle (after the noise addition, which must be performed **outside** Beagle). Note that in this case, a ``&lt;JSON mock file&gt;`` must be passed, since we must instruct PyP-BEAGLE where (in which FITS extension and column) to find the &quot;true&quot; parameters. An example of the ``&lt;JSON mock file&gt;`` to be used in this case can be found [here](https://github.com/jacopo-chevallard/PyP-BEAGLE/blob/0996fd3c6b271e15452b7edee6627bc7fbc68675/PyP-BEAGLE/files/params_names_mock.json).#### OutputThe successful execution of the script will create the files ``&lt;your Beagle results folder&gt;/pyp-beagle/plot/BEAGLE_mock_retrieved_params_hist.pdf`` and ``&lt;your Beagle results folder&gt;/pyp-beagle/plot/BEAGLE_mock_retrieved_params.pdf``.</longdescription>

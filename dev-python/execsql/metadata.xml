	<longdescription>![execsql logo](https://static-cdn.osdn.net/thumb/g/6/107/150x150_0.png)  *Multi-DBMS SQL script processor.**execsql.py* is a Python program that runs a SQL script stored in a text file against a PostgreSQL, MS-Access, SQLite, DuckDB, MS-SQL-Server, MySQL, MariaDB,Firebird, or Oracle database, or an ODBC DSN.  *execsql* also supports aset of special commands (metacommands) that can import and export data,copy data between databases, and conditionally execute SQL statements and metacommands.  These metacommands make up a control language that works the same across all supported database management systems (DBMSs). The metacommands are embedded in SQL comments, so they will be ignored by other script processors (e.g., *psql* for Postgres and *sqlcmd* for SQL Server).  The metacommands make up a toolbox that can be used to create both automated and interactive data processing applications.The program's features and requirements are summarized below.Complete documentation is available at[http://execsql.osdn.io](http://execsql.osdn.io).[![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/execsql)](https://pypi.org/project/execsql/)  [![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/execsql/month)](https://pepy.tech/project/execsql/)Capabilities=========================You can use *execsql* to:* Import data from text files or spreadsheets into  a database.* Copy data between different databases, even databases using different  types of DBMSs.* Export tables and views as formatted text, comma-separated values (CSV), tab-separated  values (TSV), OpenDocument spreadsheets, HTML tables, JSON, XML, LaTeX tables, HDF5  tables, unformatted (e.g., binary) data, or several other formats.* Export data to non-tabular formats using several different  template processors.* Display a table or view in a GUI dialog,  optionally allowing the user to select a data row, enter a data  value, or respond to a prompt.* Display a pair of tables or views in a GUI dialog, allowing the user  to compare data and find rows with matching or non-matching key values.* Conditionally execute different SQL commands and metacommands based on the DBMS in use,  the database in use, data values, user input, and other conditions.* Execute blocks of SQL statements or *execsql* metacommands repeatedly, using  any of three different looping methods.* Use simple dynamically-created data entry forms to get user input.* Write status or informational messages to the console or to a file   during the processing of a SQL script. Status messages and data exported in   text format can be combined in a single text file. Data tables can be   exported in a text format that is compatible with Markdown pipe tables,  so that script output can be converted into a variety of document formats.* Write more modular and maintainable SQL code by factoring repeated   code out into separate scripts, parameterizing the code using   substitution variables, and using the INCLUDE or SCRIPT metacommands   to merge the modules into a single stream of commands.* Merge multiple elements of a workflow—e.g., data loading, summarization, and  reporting—into a single script for better coupling of related steps and more  secure maintenance.* Use *execsql* as a CGI script for a web application that needs to run  SQL scripts and return database output.Standard SQL provides no features for interacting with external files or with the user, or for controlling the flow of actions to be carried outbased either on data or on user input.  Some DBMSs provide these features,but capabilities and syntax differ between DBMSs.  *execsql* provides these features in a way that operates identically across all supported DBMSs on both Linux and Windows.*execsql* is inherently a command-line program that can operate in a completely non-interactive mode (except for password prompts). Therefore, it is suitable for incorporation into a toolchain controlled by a shell script (on Linux), batch file (on Windows), or other system-level scripting application. When used in this mode, the only interactive elements will be password prompts.However, several metacommands generate interactive prompts and datadisplays, so *execsql* scripts can be written to provide some user interactivity.In addition, *execsql* automatically maintains a log that documents key information about each run of the program, including the databases that are used, the scripts that are run, and the user's choices in response to interactive prompts. Together, the script and the log provide documentation of all actions carried out that may have altered data.The documentation includes 30 examples showing the use of*execsql*'s metacommands, in both simple and complex scripts.Syntax and Options========================Different forms of command lines, with varying arguments and options, are shown below.Commands------------------------```    execsql.py -ta [other options] sql_script_file Access_db     execsql.py -tf [other options] sql_script_file Firebird_host Firebird_db    execsql.py -tm [other options] sql_script_file MySQL_host MySQL_db     execsql.py -tp [other options] sql_script_file Postgres_host Postgres_db    execsql.py -ts [other options] sql_script_file SQL_Server_host SQL_Server_db    execsql.py -to [other options] sql_script_file Oracle_host Oracle_service    execsql.py -tl [other options] sql_script_file SQLite_db     execsql.py -tl [other options] sql_script_file DuckDB_db     execsql.py -tl [other options] sql_script_file DSN_name ```Most arguments and options can also be specified in a configuration file, soonly the script file name need be specified on the command line.```    execsql.py sql_script_file```Command-line Arguments-----------------------------```     sql_script_file   The name of a text file of SQL commands to be executed.

These libraries must be installed to use those programs with *execsql*. Only those libraries that are needed, based on the command line arguments and metacommands, must be installed. The libraries required for each database or spreadsheet application are:* PosgreSQL: psycopg2.* MariaDB or MySQL: pymysql.* SQL Server: pydobc.* DuckDB: duckdb.* Firebird: fdb.* MS-Access: pydobc and pywin32.* Oracle: cx-Oracle.* DSN connections: pyodbc.* OpenDocument spreadsheets: odfpy.* Excel spreadsheets (read only): xlrd and openpyxl.Connections to SQLite databases are made using Python's standard library, so no additional software is needed.If the Jinja or Airspeed template processors will be used, those softwarelibraries must also be installed.All of these libraries can be installed from the Python Package Index (PyPI)using *pip*.An Illustration=================The following code illustrates the use of metacommands and substitution variables.Lines starting with &quot;\-\- !x!&quot; are metacommands that implement *execsql*-specific features.Identifiers enclosed in pairs of exclamation points (!!) are substitution variablesthat have been defined with the SUB metacommand.  The &quot;$date_tag&quot; variable isa substitution variable that is defined by *execsql* itself rather than by the user.    -- ==== Configuration ====    -- Put the (date-tagged) logfile name in the 'inputfile' substitution variable.    -- !x! SUB inputfile logs/errors_!!$date_tag!!    -- Ensure that the export directory will be created if necessary.    -- !x! CONFIG MAKE_EXPORT_DIRS Yes    -- ==== Display Fatal Errors ====    -- !x! IF(file_exists(!!inputfile!!))        -- Import the data to a staging table.        -- !x! IMPORT TO REPLACEMENT staging.errorlog FROM !!inputfile!!        -- Create a view to display only fatal errors.        create temporary view fatals as            select user, run_time, process            from   staging.errorlog            where  severity = 'FATAL';        -- !x! IF(HASROWS(fatals))            -- Export the fatal errors to a dated report.            -- !x! EXPORT fatals TO reports/error_report_!!$date_tag!! AS CSV            -- Also display it to the user in a GUI.            -- !x! PROMPT MESSAGE &quot;Fatal errors in !!inputfile!!:&quot; DISPLAY fatals        -- !x! ELSE            -- !x! WRITE &quot;There are no fatal errors.&quot;        -- !x! ENDIF    -- !x! ELSE        -- !x! WRITE &quot;There is no error log.&quot;    -- !x! ENDIF    drop table if exists staging.errorlog cascade;The IMPORT metacommand reads the specified file and loads the data intothe target (staging) table, automatically choosing appropriate data typesfor each column.  The EXPORT metacommand saves the data in a CSV filethat can be used by other applications.  The PROMPT metacommand producesa GUI display of the data as follows:![PROMPT display of 'fatals' view](http://execsql.osdn.io/_images/fatals.png)The complete documentation includes additional examples.Documentation, Tools, and Templates===========================================Complete documentation is at [OSDN](http://execsql.osdn.io).Three tools that illustrate the use of execsql, and that are useful in theirown right, are:* [Upsert scripts](https://execsql-upsert.osdn.io): A set of *execsql* scripts for  Postgres, MariaDB/MySQL, and SQL Server that will perform a merge (upsert) operation  on multiple tables simultaneously, automatically ordering the tables according to  foreign key constraints, and performing null, primary key, and foreign key data  integrity checks.  These scripts use the *information_schema* views and so operate  on any set of tables in any supported DBMS without customization.* [Staging table comparison scripts](https://execsql-compare.osdn.io): A set of *execsql*  scripts for Postgres, MariaDB/MySQL, and SQL Server that will perform various comparisons  of the data in a staging table to the data in the corresponding base table.  These scripts  use the *information_schema* views and so operate on any table in any supported DBMS  without customization.* [Glossary creation script](https://execsql-glossary.osdn.io): An *execsql* script that  will produce a table of terms (e.g., column names) and definitions, and that may be useful  to accompany a database export.The set of [execsql script templates](https://osdn.net/projects/execsql/releases/p16640)available from OSDN includes several types of templates that may be useful in conjunctionwith execsql.py. These are:* *execsql.conf*: An annotated version of the configuration file that includes all  configuration settings and notes on their usage.* *script_template.sql*: A framework for SQL scripts that make use of several *execsql*  features.  It includes sections for custom configuration settings, custom logfile creation,  and reporting of unexpected script exits (through user cancellation or errors).* *config_settings.sqlite* and *example_config_prompt.sql*: A SQLite database containing  specifications for all settings configurable with the CONFIG metacommand, in the form  used by the PROMPT ENTRY_FORM metacommand, and a SQL script illustrating how this database  can be used to prompt the user for some or all of the configuration settings.Copyright and License================================Copyright (c) 2007-2023 R.Dreas NielsenThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it underthe terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free SoftwareFoundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any laterversion.

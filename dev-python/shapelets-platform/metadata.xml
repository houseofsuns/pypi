If you are not familiar with these methods, you can find instructions below. If you want want to use the Virtual File System (VFS) feature, you need to install the drivers. You can do it with:```shpip install shapelets-platform[vfs-all]```**Alert**: With the `all` option, you will install all the drivers. We currently support **Azure Blob Storage Gen1 &amp; Gen2**, **Server Message Block (SMB)** and the local filesystem. Other fsspec-compatible protocols will be available soon.          To check if Shapelets is installed, you can execute:```shpython -c &quot;import shapelets as sh; print(sh.__version__)&quot;```It's a good idea to use a virtual environment or docker image, to avoid conflicts between versions.**Conda**Currently, conda installation is not available. ### Virtual environmentIf you want to install shapelets on a safe environment, you could also create a virtual environment that will help you to safely install shapelets without risking any corruptions.  I will show you in the following lines how to do this.  First you want to create a directory  `mkdir shapelets_ws`Then you will change directory `cd shapelets_ws`And you will create the virtual environment in the directory  `virtualenv venv`Afterward you will activate the virtual environment `source ./venv/bin/activate`Finaly you can use the pip install command to install shapelets in this environment.  ### Docker If you want to install Shapelets on a Docker container, we recommend you use our Docker Image, you can download it with:`docker pull shapeletsdev/shapelets-platform:latest`If you wish to install Shapelets on a Docker container, we recommend using our Docker image. You can download it with:`docker run --name shapelets -p 4567:4567 -d -v /[...]:/io shapeletsdev/shapelets-platform:latest`[...] = insert your own directory  This Docker image needs to expose the *4567* port, and we recommend that you create a volume to share your local scripts with the Docker container.  Now open your web browser and try `http://localhost:4567`### RecommendationsOnce you install Shapelets, you are ready to use it. If you want a recommendation about development environments, we recommend you:- To write and execute code interactively for exploratory data analysis and processing, use notebooks in `JupyterLab &lt;https://jupyter.org/install&gt;`_.- To write large scripts for processing data or build DataApps use an IDE, like  `Visual Studio Code &lt;https://code.visualstudio.com/&gt;`_.  </longdescription>

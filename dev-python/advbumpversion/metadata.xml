	<longdescription>==============ADVbumpversion==============This Fork=========This is a fork (**ADVbumpversion**) of a fork (**bump2version**).The excellent original project that can be found here: https://github.com/peritus/bumpversion.Unfortunately it seems like development has been stuck for some time and no activity has been seen from theauthor.Christian Verkerk has made some Pull Request merges and this project (renamed **bump2version**) can be found here: https://github.com/c4urself/bump2version.I have merged other Push Requests, in particular the ability to have more than one rule for a file,in a new project **ADVbumpversion**. The major differences are:- It is possible to have more than one set of rules (``parse``, ``serialize``, ``search`` and ``replace``) for thesame file- Some parts of the version can be independent of the others: They are not incremented with the other parts. It is inparticular useful when you have a build number that is incremented independently of the version- Several examples of usage- More testing casesLook at ``CHANGELOG.rst`` to see all the changes.**Note**: For compatibility, this project declares ``advbumpversion``, ``bump2version`` and ``bumpversion``. They areidentical. The remaining of this document uses ``bumpversion`` in command-line examples.Introduction============Version-bump your software with a single command!A small command line tool to simplify releasing software by updating allversion strings in your source code by the correct increment. Also createscommits and tags:- version formats are highly configurable- works without any VCS, but happily reads tag information from and writes  commits and tags to Git and Mercurial if available- just handles text files, so it's not specific to any programming languageInstallation============You can download and install the latest version of this software from the Python package index (PyPI) as follows::    pip install --upgrade advbumpversionUsage=====**Note**: I have compiled several usage examples in ``EXAMPLES.rst``.There are two modes of operation: On the command line for single-file operationand using a `configuration file &lt;#configuration&gt;`_ for more complex multi-fileoperations.::    bumpversion [options] part [file]``part`` (required)  The part of the version to increase, e.g. ``minor``.  Valid values include those given in the ``--serialize`` / ``--parse`` option.  Example bumping ``0.5.1`` to ``0.6.0``::     bumpversion --current-version 0.5.1 minor src/VERSION``[file]``  **default: none** (optional)  The file that will be modified.  If not given, the list of ``[bumpversion:file:…]`` sections from the  configuration file will be used. If no files are mentioned on the  configuration file either, are no files will be modified.  Example bumping ``1.1.9`` to ``2.0.0``::     bumpversion --current-version 1.1.9 major setup.pyConfiguration+++++++++++++All options can optionally be specified in a config file called``.bumpversion.cfg`` so that once you know how ``bumpversion`` needs to beconfigured for one particular software package, you can run it withoutspecifying options later. You should add that file to VCS so others can alsobump versions.Options on the command line take precedence over those from the config file,which take precedence over those derived from the environment and then from thedefaults.Example ``.bumpversion.cfg``::  [bumpversion]  current_version = 0.2.9  commit = True  tag = True  [bumpversion:file:setup.py]If no ``.bumpversion.cfg`` exists, ``bumpversion`` will also look into``setup.cfg`` for configuration.Global configuration--------------------General configuration is grouped in a ``[bumpversion]`` section.``current_version =``  **no default value** (required)  The current version of the software package before bumping.  Also available as ``--current-version`` (e.g. ``bumpversion --current-version 0.5.1 patch setup.py``)``new_version =``  **no default value** (optional)  The version of the software package after the increment. If not given will be  automatically determined.  Also available as ``--new-version`` (e.g. to go from 0.5.1 directly to  0.6.1: ``bumpversion --current-version 0.5.1 --new-version 0.6.1 patch  setup.py``).``tag = (True | False)``  **default:** False (`Don't create a tag`)  Whether to create a tag, that is the new version, prefixed with the character  &quot;``v``&quot;. If you are using git, don't forget to ``git-push`` with the  ``--tags`` flag.  Also available on the command line as ``(--tag | --no-tag)``.``sign_tags = (True | False)``  **default:** False (`Don't sign tags`)  Whether to sign tags.  Also available on the command line as ``(--sign-tags | --no-sign-tags)``.``tag_name =``  **default:** ``v{new_version}``  The name of the tag that will be created. Only valid when using ``--tag`` / ``tag = True``.  This is templated using the `Python Format String Syntax  &lt;http://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#format-string-syntax&gt;`_.  Available in the template context are ``current_version`` and ``new_version``  as well as all environment variables (prefixed with ``$``). You can also use  the variables ``now`` or ``utcnow`` to get a current timestamp. Both accept  datetime formatting (when used like as in ``{now:%d.%m.%Y}``).  Also available as ``--tag-name`` (e.g. ``bumpversion --message 'Jenkins Build  {$BUILD_NUMBER}: {new_version}' patch``).``tag_message =``  **default:** ``Bump version: {current_version} -&gt; {new_version}``  The annotation of the tag that will be created. Only valid when using ``--tag`` / ``tag = True``.  This is templated using the `Python Format String Syntax  &lt;http://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#format-string-syntax&gt;`_.  Available in the template context are ``current_version`` and ``new_version``  as well as all environment variables (prefixed with ``$``). You can also use  the variables ``now`` or ``utcnow`` to get a current timestamp. Both accept  datetime formatting (when used like as in ``{now:%d.%m.%Y}``).  Also available as ``--tag-message``.``commit = (True | False)``  **default:** ``False`` (`Don't create a commit`)  Whether to create a commit using git or Mercurial.  Also available as ``(--commit | --no-commit)``.``message =``  **default:** ``Bump version: {current_version} -&gt; {new_version}``  The commit message to use when creating a commit. Only valid when using ``--commit`` / ``commit = True``.  This is templated using the `Python Format String Syntax  &lt;http://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#format-string-syntax&gt;`_.  Available in the template context are ``current_version`` and ``new_version``  as well as all environment variables (prefixed with ``$``). You can also use  the variables ``now`` or ``utcnow`` to get a current timestamp. Both accept  datetime formatting (when used like as in ``{now:%d.%m.%Y}``).  Also available as ``--message`` (e.g.: ``bumpversion --message  '[{now:%Y-%m-%d}] Jenkins Build {$BUILD_NUMBER}: {new_version}' patch``)Part specific configuration---------------------------A version string consists of one or more parts, e.g. the version ``1.0.2``has three parts, separated by a dot (``.``) character. In the defaultconfiguration these parts are named `major`, `minor`, `patch`, however you cancustomize that using the ``parse``/``serialize`` option.By default all parts considered numeric, that is their initial value is ``0``and they are increased as integers. Also, the value ``0`` is considered to beoptional if it's not needed for serialization, i.e. the version ``1.4.0`` isequal to ``1.4`` if ``{major}.{minor}`` is given as a ``serialize`` value.For advanced versioning schemes, non-numeric parts may be desirable (e.g. toidentify `alpha or beta versions&lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Stages_of_development&gt;`_,to indicate the stage of development, the flavor of the software package ora release name). To do so, you can use a ``[bumpversion:part:…]`` sectioncontaining the part's name (e.g. a part named ``release_name`` is configured ina section called ``[bumpversion:part:release_name]``.The following options are valid inside a part configuration:``values =``  **default**: numeric (i.e. ``0``, ``1``, ``2``, …)  Explicit list of all values that will be iterated when bumping that specific  part.  Example::    [bumpversion:part:release_name]    values =      witty-warthog      ridiculous-rat      marvelous-mantis``optional_value =``  **default**: The first entry in ``values =``.  If the value of the part matches this value it is considered optional, i.e.  it's representation in a ``--serialize`` possibility is not required.  Example::    [bumpversion]    current_version = 1.alpha    parse = (?P&lt;num&gt;\d+)(\.(?P&lt;release&gt;.*))?    serialize =      {num}.{release}      {num}    [bumpversion:part:release]    optional_value = gamma    values =      alpha      beta      gamma  Here, ``bumpversion release`` would bump ``1.alpha`` to ``1.beta``. Executing  ``bumpversion release`` again would bump ``1.beta`` to ``1``, because  `release` being ``gamma`` is configured optional.``first_value =``  **default**: The first entry in ``values =``.  When the part is reset, the value will be set to the value specified here.``independent = ``  **default**: False  When this value is set to True, the part is not reset when other parts are incremented. Its incrementation is  independent of the other parts. It is in particular useful when you have a build number in your version that is  incremented independently of the actual version.File specific configuration---------------------------``[bumpversion:file:…:…]``**Note**: If you want to specify different options (``parse``, ...) for the same file, you can have several sections for the same file.To distinguish these sections, append ``:`` and an identifier (its value has no importance) after the file name::    [bumpversion:file.txt:0]    parse = ...    [bumpversion:file.txt:1]    parse = ...``parse =``  **default:** ``(?P&lt;major&gt;\d+)\.(?P&lt;minor&gt;\d+)\.(?P&lt;patch&gt;\d+)``  Regular expression (using `Python regular expression syntax  &lt;http://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax&gt;`_) on  how to find and parse the version string.  Is required to parse all strings produced by ``serialize =``. Named matching  groups (&quot;``(?P&lt;name&gt;...)``&quot;) provide values to as the ``part`` argument.  Also available as ``--parse````serialize =``  **default:** ``{major}.{minor}.{patch}``  Template specifying how to serialize the version parts back to a version  string.  This is templated using the `Python Format String Syntax  &lt;http://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#format-string-syntax&gt;`_.  Available in the template context are parsed values of the named groups  specified in ``parse =`` as well as all environment variables (prefixed with  ``$``).  Can be specified multiple times, bumpversion will try the serialization  formats beginning with the first and choose the last one where all values can  be represented like this::    serialize =      {major}.{minor}      {major}  Given the example above, the new version *1.9* it will be serialized as  ``1.9``, but the version *2.0* will be serialized as ``2``.  Also available as ``--serialize``. Multiple values on the command line are  given like ``--serialize {major}.{minor} --serialize {major}````search =``  **default:** ``{current_version}``  Template string how to search for the string to be replaced in the file.  Useful if the remotest possibility exists that the current version number  might be multiple times in the file and you mean to only bump one of the  occurrences. Can be multiple lines, templated using `Python Format String Syntax  &lt;http://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#format-string-syntax&gt;`_.``replace =``  **default:** ``{new_version}``  Template to create the string that will replace the current version number in  the file.  Given this ``requirements.txt``::    Django&gt;=1.5.6,&lt;1.6    MyProject==1.5.6  using this ``.bumpversion.cfg`` will ensure only the line containing  ``MyProject`` will be changed::    [bumpversion]    current_version = 1.5.6    [bumpversion:file:requirements.txt]    search = MyProject=={current_version}    replace = MyProject=={new_version}  Can be multiple lines, templated using `Python Format String Syntax  &lt;http://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#format-string-syntax&gt;`_.Options=======Most of the configuration values above can also be given as an option.Additionally, the following options are available:``--dry-run, -n``  Don't touch any files, just pretend. Best used with ``--verbose``.``--allow-dirty``  Normally, bumpversion will abort if the working directory is dirty to protect  yourself from releasing unversioned files and/or overwriting unsaved changes.  Use this option to override this check.``--verbose``  Print useful information to stderr``--list``  List machine readable information to stdout for consumption by other  programs.  Example output::    current_version=0.0.18    new_version=0.0.19``-h, --help``  Print help and exitUsing bumpversion in a script=============================If you need to use the version generated by bumpversion in a script you can make use ofthe `--list` option, combined with `grep` and `sed`.Say for example that you are using git-flow to manage your project and want to automaticallycreate a release. When you issue `git flow release start` you already need to know thenew version, before applying the change.The standard way to get it in a bash script is    bumpversion --dry-run --list &lt;part&gt; | grep &lt;field name&gt; | sed -r s,&quot;^.*=&quot;,,where &lt;part&gt; is as usual the part of the version number you are updating. You need to specify`--dry-run` to avoid bumpversion actually bumping the version number.For example, if you are updating the minor number and looking for the new version number this becomes    bumpversion --dry-run --list minor | grep new_version | sed -r s,&quot;^.*=&quot;,,Development===========Development of this happens on GitHub, patches including tests, documentationare very welcome, as well as bug reports! Also please open an issue if thistool does not support every aspect of bumping versions in your developmentworkflow, as it is intended to be very versatile.How to release bumpversion itself+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Execute the following commands::    git checkout master    git pull    make test    bumpversion release    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel upload    bumpversion --no-tag patch    git push origin master --tagsLicense=======**ADVbumpversion** is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE.rst file for details.. _changelog:Changes=======**v1.2.0**- Add ``independent`` flag for version parts. This part is not reset when other parts are incremented. For example, for  build numbers- Add EXAMPLES.rst with several test cases- Add new test cases: update version and build date, build number, annotated tags, test cases for almost all cases in  EXAMPLES.rst**v1.1.1**- Fix a bug with PR#117: allow multiple config sections per file. Add a test case.**v1.1.0**- Compatibility with Travis CI- Publish on PyPi**v1.0.0**Fork of fork.

Note that    # some headers are always scrubbed, for security reasons.    configuration.denylisted = ['HTTP-X-header']    # Castle needs the original IP of the client, not the IP of your proxy or load balancer.    # The SDK will only trust the proxy chain as defined in the configuration.    # We try to fetch the client IP based on X-Forwarded-For or Remote-Addr headers in that order,    # but sometimes the client IP may be stored in a different header or order.    # The SDK can be configured to look for the client IP address in headers that you specify.    # Sometimes, Cloud providers do not use consistent IP addresses to proxy requests.    # In this case, the client IP is usually preserved in a custom header. Example:    # Cloudflare preserves the client request in the 'Cf-Connecting-Ip' header.    # It would be used like so: configuration.ip_headers=['Cf-Connecting-Ip']    configuration.ip_headers = []    # If the specified header or X-Forwarded-For default contains a proxy chain with public IP addresses,    # then you must choose only one of the following (but not both):    # 1. The trusted_proxies value must match the known proxy IPs. This option is preferable if the IP is static.    # 2. The trusted_proxy_depth value must be set to the number of known trusted proxies in the chain (see below).    # This option is preferable if the IPs are ephemeral, but the depth is consistent.    # Additionally to make X-Forwarded-For and other headers work better discovering client ip address,    # and not the address of a reverse proxy server, you can define trusted proxies    # which will help to fetch proper ip from those headers    # In order to extract the client IP of the X-Forwarded-For header    # and not the address of a reverse proxy server, you must define all trusted public proxies    # you can achieve this by listing all the proxies ip defined by string or regular expressions    # in the trusted_proxies setting    configuration.trusted_proxies = []    # or by providing number of trusted proxies used in the chain    configuration.trusted_proxy_depth = 0    # note that you must pick one approach over the other.    # If there is no possibility to define options above and there is no other header that holds the client IP,    # then you may set trust_proxy_chain = true to trust all of the proxy IPs in X-Forwarded-For    configuration.trust_proxy_chain = false    # *Warning*: this mode is highly promiscuous and could lead to wrongly trusting a spoofed IP if the request passes through a malicious proxy    # *Note: the default list of proxies that are always marked as &quot;trusted&quot; can be found in: Castle::Configuration::TRUSTED_PROXIESUsage-------------------------------See [documentation](https://docs.castle.io) for how to use this SDK with the Castle APIsMulti-environment configuration-------------------------------It is also possible to define multiple configs within one application... code:: python    from castle.configuration import Configuration    # Initialize new instance of Castle::Configuration    config = Configuration()    config.api_secret = ':YOUR-API-SECRET'After a successful setup, you can pass the config to any API command as follows:.. code:: python    from castle.api.get_device import APIGetDevice    # Get device data    APIGetDevice.call(device_token, config)Signature---------.. code:: python    from secure_mode import signature    signature(user_id)will create a signed user_id.Exceptions----------``CastleError`` will be thrown if the Castle API returns a 400 or a 500level HTTP response.

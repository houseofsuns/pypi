No need to launch aGUI!Note: `alv` requires Python v3.4 or later. Earlier versions may also work, but this has not beentested.## Latest feature additions* If you have more than one alignment in your input file, then the first alignment is output unless you   use the --alignment-index (-ai) option to choose another.* `alv` is now adapted for use in Python notebooks (tested on Jupyter) through two convenience functions  'view' and 'glimpse'.  Both functions take a BioPython alignment object and outputs a view of the  alignment.  Writing  ```  from Bio import AlignIO  msa = AlignIO.read('PF00005.fa', 'fasta')  import alv  alv.view(msa)  ```  in a Jupyter notebook cell and evaluating will yield a colored alignment in the `alv` style.  For large alignments, the glimpse function is convenient since a subset of the alignment, selected  as an easily detected conserved region, is shown.  ```  alv.glimpse(msa)  ```  Look for more usage information view `help(alv.view)` in a notebook cell. ## Features* Command-line based, no GUI, so easy to script viewing of many (typically small) MSAs.* Reads alignments in FASTA, Clustal, PHYLIP, NEXUS, and Stockholm formats, from file or `stdin`.* Output is formatted to suit your terminal. You can also set the alignment width with option `-w`.* Can color alignments of coding DNA by codon's translations to amino acids.* Guesses sequence type (DNA/RNA/AA/coding) by default. You can override with option `-t`.* Order sequence explicitly, alphabetically, or by sequence similarity.* Restrict coloring to where you don't have indels or where there is a lot of conservation.* Focus on variable columns with the options `--only-variable` and  `--only-variable-excluding-indels`, contributed by nikostr, that constrains  coloring to columns with variation and variation not counting indels.* The command `alv -g huge_msa.fa` displays cut-out of the MSA, guaranteed to fit  one terminal page without scrolling or MSA line breaking, that is supposed to  give you an idea of alignment quality and contents.* Write `alv -r 20 huge_msa.fa` to get a view of the MSA containing only 20 randomly  selected sequences.## InstallRecommended installation is:```pip install --upgrade pippip install alv```If you have a half-modern BioPython installed, Python v3.4 _should_ work.BioPython is a dependency and will only get installed automatially with `pip install alv`if you are using Python v3.6 or later, because BioPython was apparently not on PyPi before that.## ExamplesQuick viewing of a small alignment:```alv msa.fa```This autodetects sequence type (AA, DNA, RNA, coding DNA), colors the sequences, and formats thealignment for easy viewing in your terminal.When applying `alv` to an alignment of coding DNA, the coding property is autodetected and colors are therefore applied to codons insteadof nucleotides.![Seven coding DNA sequences](https://github.com/arvestad/alv/raw/master/doc/screenshot_2.png)View three sequences, accessions `a`, `b`, and `c`, from an alignment:```alv -so a,b,c msa.fa```Feed alignment to `less`, for paging support.```alv -k msa.fa | less -R```The `-k` option ensures that `alv` keeps coloring the alignment (by default, pipingand redirection removes colors), and the `-R` option instructs `less` to interpret color codes.## For developersRun `python setup.py develop test` for development install and to execute tests.## Screenshots### Full PFAM domainAll of the sequences in PFAM's seed alignment for PF00005![PF00005 seed MSA](https://github.com/arvestad/alv/raw/master/doc/screenshot_PF00005.png)### Yeast sequences from PF00005Using the option `-sm YEAST`, we reduce the alignment to the ones with a matching accession.![Small MSA from PF00005](https://github.com/arvestad/alv/raw/master/doc/PF00005_yeast.png)</longdescription>

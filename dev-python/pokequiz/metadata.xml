	<longdescription># PokeQuiz*Current version: 1.1.2*  PokeQuiz is a command line studying tool that allows you to test your knowledge by answering randomly-generated Pokemon questions. Currently, data from generations 1 – 7 is included, but I do have plans to add generation 8 and *possibly* side-games such as Colosseum and XD Gale of Darkness in later releases.  PokeQuiz ships with a lightweight SQLite database containing information on:- Pokemon- Regions (Kanto, Johto, etc.)- Towns- Gym Leaders- Enemy Teams (Rocket, Magma, etc.)- Games (Red &amp; Blue, Silver &amp; Gold, etc.)## InstallationTo install via pip, go to your terminal and run:```cmd&gt; pip install pokequiz```To install using git, run:```cmd&gt; git clone https://github.com/Dechrissen/PokeQuiz.git&gt; cd pokequiz &amp;&amp; pip install -U .```## UsageInstalling PokeQuiz will add an entry point to your PATH named `pokequiz`.

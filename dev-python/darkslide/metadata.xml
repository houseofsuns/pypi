Darkslideconfiguration files use the ``cfg`` syntax. If you know ``ini`` files,you get the picture. Below is a sample configuration file:.. code-block:: ini    [darkslide]    ; the old [landslide] is still supported    theme  = /path/to/my/beautiful/theme    source = 0_my_first_slides.md             a_directory             another_directory             now_a_slide.markdown             another_one.rst    destination = myWonderfulPresentation.html    css =    my_first_stylesheet.css             my_other_stylesheet.css    js =     jquery.js             my_fancy_javascript.js    relative = True    linenos = inlineDon't forget to declare the ``[darkslide]`` section. All configurationfiles must end in the .cfg extension.To generate the presentation as configured, just run:::    $ cd /path/to/my/presentation/sources    $ darkslide config.cfgMacros======You can use macros to enhance your presentation:Notes-----Add notes to your slides using the ``.notes:`` keyword, eg.:::    # My Slide Title    .notes: These are my notes, hidden by default    My visible content goes hereYou can toggle display of notes by pressing the ``2`` key.Some other macros are also available by default: ``.fx: foo bar`` willadd the ``foo`` and ``bar`` classes to the corresponding slide ``&lt;div&gt;``element, easing styling of your presentation using CSS.QR Codes--------Add a QR Code to your presentation by using the ``.qr`` keyword:::    .qr: 450|https://github.com/ionelmc/python-darkslideFootnote--------Add footnote to the current and all the following presentations::    .footnote: Slides available at https://blog.ionelmc.ro/presentations/Presenter Notes===============You can also add presenter notes to each slide by following the slidecontent with a heading entitled &quot;Presenter Notes&quot;. Press the 'p' key toopen the presenter view.Registering Macros==================Macros are used to transform the HTML contents of your slide.You can register your own macros by creating ``darkslide.macro.Macro``derived classes, implementing a ``process(content, source=None)`` methodand returning a tuple containing the modified contents and some cssclasses you may be wanting to add to your slide ``&lt;div&gt;`` element. Forexample:::    !python    import darkslide    class MyMacro(darkslide.Macro):      def process(self, content, source=None):        return content + '&lt;p&gt;plop&lt;/p&gt;', ['plopped_slide']    g = darkslide.generator.Generator(source='toto.md')    g.register_macro(MyMacro)    print g.render()This will render any slide as below:::    !html    &lt;div class=&quot;slide plopped_slide&quot;&gt;      &lt;header&gt;&lt;h2&gt;foo&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/header&gt;      &lt;section&gt;        &lt;p&gt;my slide contents&lt;/p&gt;        &lt;p&gt;plop&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/section&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;Advanced Usage==============Setting Custom Destination File-------------------------------::    $ darkslide slides.md -d ~/MyPresentations/presentation.htmlWorking with Directories------------------------::    $ darkslide slides/Working with Direct Output--------------------------::    $ darkslide slides.md -o | tidyUsing an Alternate Darkslide Theme----------------------------------::    $ darkslide slides.md -t mytheme    $ darkslide slides.md -t /path/to/theme/dirEmbedding Base-64-Encoded Images--------------------------------::    $ darkslide slides.md -iEnabling Markdown Extensions----------------------------See documentation on available Markdown extensions`here &lt;https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/index.html&gt;`__:::    $ darkslide slides.md -x abbrTheming-------A Darkslide theme is a directory following this simple structure:::    mytheme/    |-- base.html    |-- css    |   |-- print.css    |   `-- screen.css    `-- js        `-- slides.jsIf a theme does not provide HTML and JS files, those from the defaulttheme will be used. CSS is not optional.Widescreen 16x9---------------You can create widescreen 16x9 slides using the ``--mod=wide16x9`` option.**NOTE:** The ``--mod=wide16x9`` option causes the files in Darkslide's ``themes/wide16x9/``directory to supersede the corresponding files in Darkslide's ``themes/default/``directory before the selected theme (if any) is applied.User stylesheets and Javascripts================================If you don't want to bother making your own theme, you can include yourown user css and js files to the generated presentation.This feature is only available if you use a Darkslide configurationfile, by setting the ``css`` and/or ``js`` flags:::    [darkslide]    ; the old [landslide] is still supported    theme  = /path/to/my/beautiful/theme    source = slides.mdown    css =    custom.css    js =     jquery.js             powerpoint.jsThese will link the ``custom.css`` stylesheet and both the ``jquery.js``and ``powerpoint.js`` files within the ``&lt;head&gt;`` section of thepresentation html file.**NOTE:** Paths to the css and js files must be relative to thedirectory you're running the ``darkslide`` command from.Publishing your Presentation Online===================================For online publishing use the ``--embed`` option to produce a standaloneHTML file with no dependencies::    $ darkslide slides.md --embedTheme Variables===============The ``base.html`` must be a `Jinja2 templatefile &lt;http://jinja.pocoo.org/2/documentation/templates&gt;`__ where you canharness the following template variables:-  ``css``: the stylesheet contents, available via two keys, ``print``   and ``screen``, both having:-  a ``path_url`` key storing the url to the asset file path-  a ``contents`` key storing the asset contents-  ``js``: the javascript contents, having:-  a ``path_url`` key storing the url to the asset file path-  a ``contents`` key storing the asset contents-  ``slides``: the slides list, each one having these properties:-  ``header``: the slide title-  ``content``: the slide contents-  ``number``: the slide number-  ``embed``: is the current document a standalone one?-  ``num_slides``: the number of slides in current presentation-  ``toc``: the Table of Contents, listing sections of the document.   Each section has these properties available:-  ``title``: the section title-  ``number``: the slide number of the section-  ``sub``: subsections, if anyStyles Scope============-  To change HTML5 presentation styles, tweak the ``css/screen.css``   stylesheet bundled with the theme you are using-  For printing, modify the ``css/print.css``Authors=======The project was originally named Landslide and was authored byAdam Zapletal (adamzap@gmail.com) and Nicolas Perriault (nperriault@gmail.com)Slide code is based on html5-slides.More details: https://github.com/ionelmc/python-darkslide/contributors=========Changelog=========Darkslide v6.0.0 (2020-07-24)=============================* Dropped the ``--copy-theme`` option (**backwards incompatible**).* Added support for theme mods (the ``--mod`` option) and reworked the asset management internals.* Added a wide 16:9 theme mod.  Contributed by Eric Moyer in `#19 &lt;https://github.com/ionelmc/python-darkslide/pull/19&gt;`_.Darkslide v5.1.0 (2020-01-13)=============================* Added support for embedding webfonts.  Contributed by Emmanuel Ohayon in `#17 &lt;https://github.com/ionelmc/python-darkslide/pull/17&gt;`_.* Refactored user css and js path processing code.* Relativized user css and js paths to the configuration directory (CWD if there's no configuration file).Darkslide v5.0.2 (2019-12-07)=============================* Fixed a small bug in the image embedding feature (image detection in CSS file  could fail).Darkslide v5.0.1 (2019-10-01)=============================* Fixed media for user css to be always be ``all``. Previously it was ``screen, projection`` if embedded.Darkslide v5.0.0 (2019-09-29)=============================* Removed PDF export support. You should just use the PDF export from  Google Chrome (it works way better than the alternatives).* Fixed transitions in presenter mode.* Added support for Up/Down arrow navigation.  Contributed by Heiko Schlittermann in `#13 &lt;https://github.com/ionelmc/python-darkslide/pull/13&gt;`_.* Added support for Markdown 3.0+ and Textile 2.3+.* Changed the broken ``.notes:`` macro to output presenter notes.Darkslide v4.0.1 (2017-10-19)=============================* Fixed print css a bit.* Fixed missing scrolling to current when changing slides while in overview mode.Darkslide v4.0.0 (2017-10-17)=============================* Dropped MathJax support. Something less to maintain (also, didn't work as expected with ``--embed``). User that need this  should just use the ``user_js`` option. Or a custom theme.* Changed themes to use a space-adjusted Alegreya Sans as a fallback.Darkslide v3.2.0 (2017-10-17)=============================* Changed themes to use Rosario as a fallback. For better or worse it's smaller and has same width as Candara.Darkslide v3.1.0 (2017-10-17)=============================* Changed themes to embed a Candara fallback webfont (Alegreya Sans). It's slightly narrower but looks more similar than the other  alternatives better matching Candara's width (Acme, Galdeano). It even has ligatures.Darkslide v3.0.1 (2017-10-15)=============================* Fixed slightly broken slide class changing.* Made expose mode scroll to current slide.* Running presenter mode with no target won't break  anymore if target window is gone.* Fixed display of presenter notes.Darkslide v3.0.0 (2017-10-05)=============================* Removed &quot;expanded mode&quot;. It was too buggy and doesn't really have a purpose.* Changed &quot;show context&quot; to be &quot;show next slide&quot; (so two slides at a time). This is way more useful than showing little  bits of next and prev slides.* Fixed ``--direct`` on Python 3.* Fixed glitches when TOC/Help are open.* Made possible to switch slides when TOC/Help/Overview are open.Darkslide v2.3.3 (2016-05-15)=============================* Fixed height of QR svg elements.Darkslide v2.3.2 (2016-04-12)=============================* Fixed underline occlusion shadows in the footer (for links).* Fixed missing `presenter_notes` class not being set when notes mode was on.Darkslide v2.3.1 (2016-02-08)=============================* MathJax is loaded on HTTPS.Darkslide v2.3.0 (2016-02-07)=============================* The Darkslide version is shown in the help sidebar.Darkslide v2.2.1 (2015-10-06)=============================* Fixed config file parsing for math_output.Darkslide v2.2.0 (2015-10-06)=============================* Now macro failures abort rendering. Previously they would just log a message that you'd probably woulnd't notice.* Fixed broken handling where you have css/js in the cfg file.* Allowed setting the math_output option in the cfg file.* Fixed encoding issues in the QR macro.* Added back the old theme with completely black background (as &quot;void&quot;).* Tweak the faux underlines to look better.Darkslide v2.1.0 (2015-10-05)=============================* Added demo links.* Fixed options handling. Options from command line now will actually work if a cfg file is used.* Corrected relative paths handling:  - paths in sources are now relative to the cfg file (previously they were relative to whatever was cwd).  - relative option now correctly works when destination file is not in cwd.* Fixed layout of slides with many headering (no more paddings for headings, all root elements are spread out evenly  anyway).* Fixed bad styling of ToC (and probably other things in the sidebar).* Fixed ToC links (contributed by Cyrille Pontvieux).Darkslide v2.0.4 (2015-09-09)=============================* Improved handling for filenames that have non-ascii characters in them.Darkslide v2.0.3 (2015-09-08)=============================* Fixed handling for filenames that have non-ascii characters in them.Darkslide v2.0.2 (2015-07-20)=============================- Added color classes in the abyss theme.- Fixed link underlines in the presenter notes.Darkslide v2.0.1 (2015-07-19)=============================* Don't use Monaco in the ``base.css`` - it's way bigger than Consolas and the other fonts. And Consolas is nice enough.Darkslide v2.0.0 (2015-07-17)=============================- Fix display of RST image target links.- Add cmd line option to print version.- Rewrote the default theme (solarized colors)- Overhauled the abyss theme, improved the coloring.- Removed all the other themes (they are ugly and broken anyway) (**backwards incompatible**).- Fixes for print css.- Added support for two new css files: ``base.css`` and ``theme.css``. This  makes reusing styles acros themes and kinds of display (print/screen) more easy.- Expanded mode is now activated by default.- Changed macros to use compiled regexes.- Added a footnote macro.- Changed QR macro to use ``qrcode`` library. Now it's rendered to SVG. The size is removed (**backwards incompatible**).Darkslide v1.2.2 (2015-05-22)=============================- Fix the blank page issue when generating pdfs (via Chrome's pdf printer).Darkslide v1.2.1 (2015-05-21)=============================- Couple minor improvements to Abyss theme.Darkslide v1.2.0 (2015-05-19)=============================- Modifier keys flag was not cleared propertly (kb shortcuts were not working anymore after  alt-tab etc); now it's cleared on visibility changes and focus loss.- Changed expanded mode to automatically hide the context.- Fixed window resize flickering (for every resize event the expaded flag was toggled).- Disabled context hiding in presenter view.- Other small styling improvements.- Added &quot;abyss&quot; theme.Landslide v1.1.3================-  Identify each slide by a numbered class (#171) (dkg)-  Fix theme image embedding regex to grab all images (#170)-  Fix blockquote font size for rst (#161)-  Fix display of RST image target links (#87)-  Fix relative path generation (#147)-  Add command line option for print version (#135)-  Add use of '---' as a slide separator to textile files (#163)-  README improvements (#88 and #101)-  Improve image path regex and replacement (#177)Landslide v1.1.2================-  Add support for Python 3-  Allow support for copy\_theme argument in CFG files (#139) (syscomet)-  Improve MathJax rendering for Markdown files-  Support math output (#144) (davidedelvento)-  Allow presenter notes in slides with no heading in RST files (#141)   (regebro)-  And more...Landslide v1.1.1================Fixes------  Don't accidentally require watchdog (#134)Landslide v1.1.0================Major Enhancements-------------------  Add CHANGELOG-  Add &quot;ribbon&quot; theme from &quot;shower&quot; presentation tool (#129) (durden)-  Add ``-w`` flag for watching/auto-regenerating slideshow (#71, #120)   (jondkoon)Minor Enhancements-------------------  Supress ReST rendering errors-  CSS pre enhancements (#91) (roktas)-  Add an example using presenter notes (#106) (netantho)-  Run macros on headers also, to embed images (#74) (godfat)-  Allow PHP code snippets to not require &lt;?php (#127) (akrabat)-  Allow for line numbers and emphasis with reStructuredText (#97)   (copelco)-  Add an option to strip presenter notes from output (#107) (aaugustin)Fixes------  Firefox offset bug on next slide (#73)-  Fix base64 encoding issue (#109) (ackdesha)-  Fix to embed images defined in CSS (#126) (akrabat)-  Minor documentation fixes (#119, #131) (durden, spin6lock)-  Use configured encoding when reading all embedded files (#125)   (iguananaut)-  Allow pygments lexer names that include special characters (#123)   (shreyankg)</longdescription>

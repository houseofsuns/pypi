	<longdescription># `achilles`Distributed/parallel computing in modern Python based on the `multiprocessing.Pool` API (`map`, `imap`, `imap_unordered`).## What/why is it?The purpose of `achilles` is to make distributed/parallel computing as easy as possible by limiting the required configuration, hiding the details (server/node/controller architecture) and exposing a simple interface based on the popular `multiprocessing.Pool` API.&gt; `achilles` provides developers with entry-level capabilities for concurrency across a network of machines (see PEP 372 on the intent behind adding `multiprocessing` to the standard library -&gt; https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0371/) using a server/node/controller architecture.The `achilles_server`, `achilles_node` and `achilles_controller` are designed to run cross-platform/cross-architecture. The server/node/controller may be hosted on a single machine (for development) or deployed across heterogeneous resources.`achilles` is comparable to excellent Python packages like `pathos/pyina`, `Parallel Python` and `SCOOP`, but different in certain ways:- Designed for developers familiar with the `multiprocessing` module in the standard library with simplicity and ease of use in mind.- In addition to the blocking `map` API which requires that developers wait for all computation to be finished before accessing results (common in such packages), `imap`/`imap_unordered` allow developers to process results as they are returned to the `achilles_controller` by the `achilles_server`.- `achilles` allows for composable scalability and novel design patterns as:    - Iterables including lists, lists of lists and generator functions (as first-class object - generator expressions will not work as generators cannot be serialized by `pickle`/`dill`) are accepted as arguments.        - TIP: Use generator functions together with `imap` or `imap_unordered` to perform distributed computation on arbitrarily large data.    - The `dill` serializer is used to transfer data between the server/node/controller and `multiprocess` (fork of `multiprocessing` that uses the `dill` serializer instead of `pickle`) is used to perform `Pool.map` on the `achilles_nodes`, so developers are freed from some of the constraints of the `pickle` serializer.    &lt;br/&gt;### Install`pip install achilles`### Quick StartStart an `achilles_server` listening for connections from `achilles_nodes` at a certain endpoint specified as arguments or in an `.env` file in the `achilles` package's directory.Then simply import `map`, `imap`, and/or `imap_unordered` from `achilles_main` and use them dynamically in your own code (under the hood they create and close `achilles_controller`s).`map`, `imap` and `imap_unordered` will distribute your function to each `achilles_node` connected to the `achilles_server`. Then, the `achilles_server` will distribute arguments to each `achilles_node` (load balanced and made into a list of arguments if the arguments' type is not already a list) which will then perform your function on the arguments using `multiprocess.Pool.map`.Each `achilles_node` finishes its work, returns the results to the `achilles_server` and waits to receive another argument. This process is repeated until all of the arguments have been exhausted.1) `runAchillesServer(host=None, port=None, username=None, secret_key=None)` -&gt; run on your local machine or on another machine connected to your network    `in:`    ```python    from achilles.lineReceiver.achilles_server import runAchillesServer   # host = IP address of the achilles_server   # port = port to listen on for connections from achilles_nodes (must be an int)   # username, secret_key used for authentication with achilles_controller   runAchillesServer(host='127.0.0.1', port=9999, username='foo', secret_key='bar')   ```   ```python   # OR generate an .env file with a default configuration so that   # arguments are no longer required to runAchillesServer()   # use genConfig() to overwrite   from achilles.lineReceiver.achilles_server import runAchillesServer, genConfig   genConfig(host='127.0.0.1', port=9999, username='foo', secret_key='bar')   runAchillesServer()    ```    &lt;br/&gt;    `out:`    ```    ALERT: achilles_server initiated at 127.0.0.1:9999    Listening for connections...    ```2) `runAchillesNode(host=None, port=None)` -&gt; run on your local machine or on another machine connected to your network    `in:`    ```python    from achilles.lineReceiver.achilles_node import runAchillesNode   # genConfig() is also available in achilles_node, but only expects host and port arguments    runAchillesNode(host='127.0.0.1', port=9999)    ```    &lt;br/&gt;       `out:`    ```    GREETING: Welcome!

Current recommended solution is to SSH into each machine and `pip install` a `requirements.txt` file.- All import statements required by the developer's function, arguments and callback must be included in the definition of the function.- The `achilles_server` is currently designed to handle one job at a time. For more complicated projects, I highly recommend checking out `Dask` (especially `dask.distributed`) and learning more about directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).- Fault tolerance: if some `achilles_node` disconnects before returning expected results, the argument will be distributed to another `achilles_node` for computation instead of being lost.- `callback_error` argument has yet to be implemented, so detailed information regarding errors can only be gleaned from the interpreter used to launch the `achilles_server`, `achilles_node` or `achilles_controller`. Deploying the server/node/controller on a single machine is recommended for development.- `achilles` performs load balancing at runtime and assigns `achilles_node`s arguments by `cpu_count` * `chunksize`.    - Default `chunksize` is 1.    - Increasing the `chunksize` is an easy way to speed up computation and reduce the amount of time spent transferring data between the server/node/controller.- If your arguments are already lists, the `chunksize` argument is not used.    - Instead, one argument/list will be distributed to the connected `achilles_node`s at a time.- If your arguments are load balanced, the results returned are contained in lists of length `achilles_node's cpu_count` *  `chunksize`.    - `map`:        - Final result of `map` is an ordered list of load balanced lists (the final result is not flattened).    - `imap`:        - Results are returned as computation is finished in dictionaries that include the following keys:            - `RESULT`: load balanced list of results.            - `ARGS_COUNTER`: index of first argument (0-indexed).         - Results are ordered.             - The first result will correspond to the next result after the last result in the preceding results packet's list of results.             - Likely to be slower than `immap_unordered` due to `achilles_controller` yielding ordered results. `imap_unordered` (see below) yields results as they are received, while `imap` yields results as they are received only if the argument's `ARGS_COUNTER` is expected based on the length of the `RESULT` list in the preceding results packet. Otherwise, a `result_buffer` is checked for the results packet with the expected `ARGS_COUNTER` and the current results packet is added to the `result_buffer`. If it is not found, `achilles_controller` will not yield results until a results packet with the expected `ARGS_COUNTER` is received.    - `imap_unordered`:        - Results are returned as computation is finished in dictionaries that include the following keys:            - `RESULT`: load balanced list of results.            - `ARGS_COUNTER`: index of first argument (0-indexed).         - Results are not ordered.             - Results packets are yielded as they are received (after any `achilles_callback` has been performed on it).             - Fastest way of consuming results received from the `achilles_server`.&lt;hr/&gt;`achilles` is in the early stages of active development and your suggestions/contributions are kindly welcomed.`achilles` is written and maintained by Alejandro PeÃ±a.

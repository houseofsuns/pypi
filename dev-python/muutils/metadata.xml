This needs to be moved into ZANJ, probably- [`group_equiv`](https://github.com/mivanit/muutils/tree/main/muutils/group_equiv.py) groups elements from a sequence according to a given equivalence relation, without assuming that the equivalence relation obeys the transitive property- [`logger`](https://github.com/mivanit/muutils/tree/main/muutils/logger.py) implements a logger with &quot;streams&quot; and a timer context manager- [`jsonlines`](https://github.com/mivanit/muutils/tree/main/muutils/jsonlines.py) extremely simple utility for reading/writing `jsonl` files- [`ZANJ`](https://github.com/mivanit/ZANJ/) is a WIP hdf5 alternative. This ~~will probably be~~ has been spun off into its own repoThere are a couple work-in-progress utilities in [`_wip`](https://github.com/mivanit/muutils/tree/main/muutils/_wip/) that aren't ready for anything, but nothing in this repo is suitable for production. Use at your own risk!# installationPyPi: [muutils](https://pypi.org/project/muutils/)```pip install muutils```Note that for using `mlutils`, `tensor_utils`, `nbutils.configure_notebook`, or the array serialization features of `json_serialize`, you will need to install with optional `array` dependencies:```pip install muutils[array]```# todos:- [ ] option to have notebook conversion create pytest-compatible tests</longdescription>

	<longdescription># sphinxcontrib-drawio-htmlSphinx Extension to add the ``drawio-html`` directive to include draw.io diagrams into the generated HTML documentation.**Important:** This is an alpha extension and as such may not work orfit your needs 100%.  See the KNOWN ISSUES SECTION. ## Installation1. ``python3 -m pip install sphinxcontrib-drawio-html`` or use ``pipenv`` 2. In your sphinx config:```pythonextensions = [    &quot;sphinxdrawio.drawio_html&quot;]```## OptionsAt this time no options in ``conf.py`` are supported. ## Usage```.. drawio-html:: example.drawio    :page: class-diagram    :expanded:    :hide-nav:    :force-name:    style-overrides```## known issues1. This extension is tested using read-the-docs theme only.  It uses jQuery and font-awesome   that comes with rtd theme, and without the theme, it will not likely work. 2. Only HTML translators are created, which means Latex and PDF support will not likely   work. PDF and other builders are not tried at all. 3. Custom styleoverrides are working intermittently.  Some with HTML/CSS expertise might   help in troubleshooting why not. ## Wish list 1. Provide defaults in the conf.py for expanded, hide-nav and force-name so that, a site   can decide their basic way of showing the files.  Currently it has to be done at    each file. 2. Change the content area to accept some rst per page in the draw.io diagram so that it   can interspread easily with in the diagrams.  Presentation can also be changed to show   the diagrams and content for that section. Only option for now is the add multiple   directives.     ```    .. drawio-html:: example.drawio        :expanded:        :hide-nav:        :force-name:        style-overrides        class-diagram:            lorum ipsum dorum        sequence-diagram:            nice orderly work.    ```3. Add some tests.  Do not even know how other sphinx extensions are tested. 4. Full screen display of the diagrams. 5. Provided notes can be added per diagram, provide a layout option to place   notes on the right or bottom. Do file issues if you see something, or better yet open a pull request :-) ## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS1. This is inspired by the work done by here:  https://github.com/Modelmat/sphinxcontrib-drawio2.

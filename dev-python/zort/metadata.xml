	<longdescription># zort : ZTF Object Reader Tool## Getting StartedThe ZTF Object Reader Tool, ```zort```, is set of functions to organize and access the ZTF Public Data Release lightcurves across multiple colors. ### ZTF Public Data Release LightcurvesInstructions for downloading and extracting ZTF Public Data Release Lightcurves can be found at: https://www.ztf.caltech.edu/page/dr2#12cThe ZTF Public Data Release Lightcurves are generated through spatially cross-matching individual epoch photometric catalogs. Catalogs are pre-filtered to be (1) the same ZTF observation field ID, (2) the same CCD readout channel, and (3) the same photometric color. Spatially coincidenceobservations in these catalogs are all labelled as objects and saved to a common ascii file along with the observation data for each epoch of the object. These files are consolidated such that all objects sharing a common ZTF observation field ID reside in the same file.```zort``` refers to these files with extension ```*.txt``` as **lightcurve files**.### Features```zort``` provides facilitates the reading and inspection of lightcurves in the ZTF Public Data Release. The features of ```zort``` include:- Seamless looping through ZTF lightcurves for custom filtering, where interesting objects can be saved and recovered by only their file location- Consolidating g-band and R-band lightcurves of a single source that are otherwise labelled as two separate objects by pairing objects as &quot;siblings&quot;- Plotting lightcurves in multiple colors for visual inspection### InstallationPreferred method is through pip:```pip install zort```Latest version can also be installed from github:```git clone https://github.com/MichaelMedford/zort.gitcd zortpython setup.py install```### Terminology- **lightcurve file**: Files included in the ZTF Public Data Release containing epoch photometry for spatially coincidence observations- **object**: A collection of spatially coincident observations in a single color. Objects include IDs, sky locations (in right ascension and declination) and colors (g-band and R-band).- **lightcurve**: Observation epochs of an object. Lightcurve observations include dates, magnitudes and magnitude errors.- **radec_map**: Binary search trees for the objects in a lightcurve file. required for faster object access.- **siblings**: A spatially coincident object in a different color originating from the same astrophysical source.### Initialization```zort``` requires two additional data products per lightcurve file (```*.txt```) in order to make object discovery and multiple color consolidation faster. Object files (```*.objects```) contain all of the metadata for each object in a lightcurve file. RCID map files (```*.radec_map```) contain binary search trees that facilitates faster matching of multiple colors for individual objects. ```zort``` requires that each lightcurve file has a corresponding object file and RCID map file.To generate object files and RCID map files for a directory of lightcurve files, run```zort-initialize -lightcurve-file-directory=LIGHTCURVE_FILE_DIRECTORY -single```or if mpi4py is installed then launch multiple instances of ```zort-initialize -lightcurve-file-directory=LIGHTCURVE_FILE_DIRECTORY -parallel```If each lightcurve file does not have an object file and an RCID map then ```zort``` will not be able to locate siblings## Examples### Extracting Lightcurves```zort``` is designed to provide you with easy access to all of the lightcurves in a lightcurve file for applying filters and saving interesting objects. The preferred method for inspecting lightcurves is through a for-loop.A filter is created that returns True for interesting objects. This filter can involve simply cuts on object properties or complicated model fitting to the full observation data in the object's lightcurve```def my_interesting_filter(obj):    cond1 = obj.nepochs &gt;= 20    cond2 = min(obj.lightcurve.mag) &lt;= 17.0    if cond1 and cond2:        return True    else:        return False```When a lightcurve file is looped over, it returns each object in the lightcurvefile. Interesting objects can be gathered into a list and saved to disk using the ```save_objects``` function.```filename = 'lightcurve_file_example.txt'interesting_objects = []from zort.lightcurveFile import LightcurveFilefor obj in LightcurveFile(filename):    if my_interesting_filter(obj):        interesting_objects.append(obj)from zort.object import save_objectssave_objects('objects.list', interesting_objects)```Objects and their lightcurves can be retrieved from a saved list by using the ```load_objects``` function. Each object comes loaded with its metadata and lightcurve, easily previewed by printing the object and lightcurve attribute. ```from zort.object import load_objectsinteresting_objects = load_objects('objects.list')for obj in interesting_objects:    print(obj)    print(obj.lightcurve)``` Objects can also be extracted in parallel by instantiating the LightcurveFile class with a rank and size. This could be done through mpi4py, or other parallelization packages. The LightcurveFile class simply needs to be told the rank of the parallel process and the total number, or size, of the parallelprocesses. ```from mpi4py import MPIcomm = MPI.COMM_WORLDrank = comm.ranksize = comm.sizefilename = 'lightcurve_file_example.txt'interesting_objects = []from zort.lightcurveFile import LightcurveFilefor obj in LightcurveFile(filename, proc_rank=rank, proc_size=size):    if my_interesting_filter(obj):        interesting_objects.append(obj)from zort.object import save_objectssave_objects('objects.%i.list' % rank, interesting_objects)```Setting the ```proc_rank``` and ```proc_size``` parameters will cause the iterator to uniquely send different objects to each parallel process without loading all of the objects into memory for each process. This allows for applying a filter to all of the objects in a lightcurve file without overloading memory.### Matching multiple colors for an objectEach object is defined as a spatially coincidence series of observations that share a (1) ZTF observation field ID, (2) CCD readout channel, and (3) photometric filter. This labels multiple colors of the same astrophysical source as separate ZTF objects with separate object IDs. The ZTF Public Data Release does not provide any native support for pairing these objects as multiple colors of the same source.```zort``` supports searching for and saving multiple colors for the same source. The ZTF Public Data Release contains observations in g-band (filterid=1) and R-band (filterid=2). Each object can therefore have one additional object that comes from the same astrophysical source but is in a different color. These matching objects are labelled as &quot;siblings&quot; and can be both discovered and saved with ```zort```.The siblings for each object can be located by simply running an object's  ```locate_siblings``` method. Running```filename = 'field000245_ra357.03053to5.26702_dec-27.96964to-20.4773.txt'buffer_position = 6852obj = Object(filename, buffer_position)obj.locate_siblings(printFlag=True)```results in```Locating siblings for ZTF Object 245101100000025-- Object location: 4.74852, -26.23583 ...** siblings file missing! **-- Searching between buffers 17749819 and 18135260---- Sibling found at 4.74851, -26.23581 !---- Original Color: 1 | Sibling Color: 2---- Sibling saved```  An object's siblings is itself another object and can be accessed through the siblings attribute.```print(obj)Filename: field000245_ra357.03053to5.26702_dec-27.96964to-20.4773.txtBuffer Position: 6852Object ID: 245101100000025Color: gRa/Dec: (4.74852, -26.23583)22 Epochs passing quality cutsprint(obj.siblings)Filename: field000245_ra357.03053to5.26702_dec-27.96964to-20.4773.txtBuffer Position: 126136890Object ID: 245201100000047Color: rRa/Dec: (4.74851, -26.23581)22 Epochs passing quality cuts```The default tolerance for matching two objects as siblings is 2.0&quot;. However this can be altered by setting the ```radius``` argument in ```obj.locate_siblings()```.  ### Plotting lightcurvesA lightcurve plot can be generated for any object using the ```obj.plot_lightcurve()``` method.![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MichaelMedford/zort/master/example_images/field000245_ra357.03053to5.26702_dec-27.96964to-20.4773.txt-6852-lc.png)A lightcurve plot including an object's siblings cand be generated using the ```obj.plot_lightcurves()``` method.![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MichaelMedford/zort/master/example_images/field000245_ra357.03053to5.26702_dec-27.96964to-20.4773.txt-6852-lc-with_siblings.png)## Requirements* python 3.6* numpy* scipy* astropy* matplotlib* shapely## Authors* Michael Medford &lt;MichaelMedford@berkeley.edu&gt;## Citation[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/200887248.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/200887248)</longdescription>

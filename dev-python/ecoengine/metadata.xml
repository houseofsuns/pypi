Navigate to the EcosizerEngine directory.2. Create new environment from .yml file.$ conda env create --file EcosizerEngine.ymlIf the environment creation doesn't work, make sure Anaconda is up-to-date with    $ conda update --allIf that doesn't work, you may need to force Anaconda to download and use python 3.11 (it defaults to 3.9) by making another environment    $ conda create -n py311 python=3.11    $ conda activate py311    $ conda env create --file EcosizerEngine.yml3. Check that the environment was created$ conda env list4. Activate the new environment$ conda activate EcosizerEngineIf an environment already exits it can be removed with:$ conda remove --name EcosizerEngine --allAll the available environment can be found with:$ conda env list### Testing:From the parent directory, type$ python -m pytestThis will run all unit tests for the package### Updating Documentation:1. If not installed in environment: pip install sphinx and numpydoc2. navigate to docs directory and run:$ make html### Updating version on pypi1. If you haven't installed them before, pip install build and twine$ python -m pip install --upgrade build$ python -m pip install --user --upgrade twine2. Update the version number in setup.cfg3.

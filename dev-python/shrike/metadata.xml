Thislibrary contains four elements, which are:-  `shrike.compliant_logging`: utilities for compliant logging and exception handling;-  `shrike.pipeline`: helper code for managing, validating and submitting AzureML pipelines based on [azure-ml-component](https://aka.ms/azure-ml-component-reference) (_a.k.a._ the Component SDK);-  `shrike.build`: helper code for packaging, building, validating, signing andregistering Azure ML components.- `shrike.spark`: utilities for running jobs, especially those leveraging Spark  .NET, in HDInsight and later Synapse.## DocumentationFor the full documentation of `shrike` with detailed examples and API reference, please see the [docs page](https://shrike-docs.com/).For a list of problems (along with guidance and solutions) designed specificallyto help you learn how to use shrike, please refer to the information in[this README file](https://github.com/Azure/azure-ml-problem-sets/blob/main/README.md#azure-ml-problems-aimed-at-learning-shrike)(located in another GitHub repository).## InstallationThe `shrike` library is publicly available in PyPi. There are three optional extra dependencies: `pipeline`, `build`, and `dev`.The `pipeline` dependency is for submitting Azure ML pipelines, `build` is for signing and registering components, and `dev` is for the development environment of `shrike`.- If you are only planning on using the compliant-logging feature, please `pip install` without any extras:```pwshpip install shrike```- If you are planning on signing and registering components, please `pip install` with `[build]`:```pwshpip install shrike[build]```- If you are planning on submitting Azure ML pipelines, please `pip install` with `[pipeline]`:```pwshpip install shrike[pipeline]```- If you would like to contribute to the source code, please `pip install` with all the dependencies:```pwshpip install shrike[pipeline,build,dev]```Alternatively, for local development, you may use the Conda environment definedin [environment.yml](./environment.yml). It pins the appropriate versions ofpip, Python, and installs all shrike together with all extras as an editablepackage.:warning: If you are using a ZSH terminal, please consider adding quotes,e.g., `pip install &quot;shrike[pipeline,build,dev]&quot;` to avoid the accidental shell expansion.## Migration from `aml-build-tooling`, `aml-ds-pipeline-contrib`, and `confidential-ml-utils`If you have been using the `aml-build-tooling`, `aml-ds-pipeline-contrib`, or `confidential-ml-utils` libraries, please use the migration script ([migration.py](https://github.com/ai-platform-ml-platform/shrike/blob/main/migration.py)) to convert your repo or files andadopt the `shrike` package with one simple command:```pwshpython migraton.py --input_path PATH/TO/YOUR/REPO/OR/FILE```:warning: This command will update files **in-place**. Please make a copy of your repo/file if you do not want to do so.## Need Support?If you have any feature requests, technical questions, or findany bugs, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.- For bug reports and feature requests, you are welcome to open an [issue](https://github.com/ai-platform-ml-platform/shrike/issues). - If you are a Microsoft employee, please refer to the [support page](https://aka.ms/aml/support) for details;- If you are outside Microsoft, please send an emailto [aims-team@microsoft.com](mailto:aims-team@microsoft.com). ## ContributingThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions.

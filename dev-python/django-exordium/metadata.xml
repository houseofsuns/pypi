	<longdescription>========Exordium========Exordium is a read-only web-based music library system for Django.Exordium will read mp3 and ogg files from the host filesystem and providean online interface to browse, download (as zipfiles or otherwise), andstream.The HTML5 media player `jPlayer &lt;http://jplayer.org/&gt;`_ is used to providearbitrary streaming of music.Exordium was built with a very specific set of operational goals and doesnot attempt to be a generic library suitable for widespread use.  There are,in fact, no configuration options beyond those to define the file paths/URLsnecessary for basic usage.  Patches to add/change functionality will behappily received so long as they don't interfere with or disable the currentfunctionality by default, but there is no internal development goal to makeExordium a generic solution.Detailed information about what Exordium expects from your library, and itsassumptions and limitations, can be found either in the ``docs/`` directory,`Exordium's Website &lt;https://apocalyptech.com/exordium&gt;`_, or`exordium.readthedocs.io &lt;https://exordium.readthedocs.io/&gt;`_.  It'shighly recommended to at least glance through these to get a feel for howExordium will function.The name &quot;Exordium&quot; comes from the fictional technology of the same name inAlastair Reynolds' &quot;Revelation Space&quot; novels.  It's not a perfect name forthe app, given that the Revelation Space *Exordium* would make a prettylousy music library, but at least there's some element of data storage andretrieval.  Exordium the *web-based music library*, as opposed to itsfictional counterpart, is only capable of retrieving music which has beenimported to it in the past.  I'll be sure to contact all the major newsorganizations if I figure out a way to get it to retrieve music stored in thefuture.Requirements------------Exordium requires at least Python 3.8 *(tested on 3.9)*, and Django 4.0.It requires the following additional third-party modules:- mutagen (built on 1.45)- Pillow (built on 9.0)- django-tables2 (built on 2.4)- django-dynamic-preferences (built on 1.11), which in turn requires:  - six (built on 1.16.0)  - persisting-theory (built on 0.2.1)One unit test module additionally requires django-test-migrations (testedwith 1.2.0), but that's not required to run it.Getting Exordium----------------Exordium is available to install on PyPI via ``pip install django-exordium``.PyPI also hosts Python packages for Exordium in both source and`Wheel &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wheel&gt;`_ formats, at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-exordium/.  Source and Wheel downloadsof all released versions can also be found at Exordium's hompeage athttps://apocalyptech.com/exordium/.Exordium sourcecode is hosted at `GitHub &lt;https://github.com/apocalyptech/exordium/&gt;`_,and sourcecode archives of released versions can be found there athttps://github.com/apocalyptech/exordium/releasesInstallation------------These instructions assume that you already have a Django project up andrunning.1. Install Exordium via ``pip install django-exordium``   - If Exordium hasn't been installed via ``pip`` or some other method which     automatically installs dependencies, install its dependencies::        pip install -r requirements.txt2. Add exordium, django_tables2, and dynamic_preferences to your   ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting like this::     INSTALLED_APPS = [         ...         'exordium',         'django_tables2',         'dynamic_preferences',         'dynamic_preferences.users.apps.UserPreferencesConfig',     ]3. *(Optional)* For jPlayer streaming to work properly on a &quot;live&quot;   install, the `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy &lt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy&gt;`_   HTTP header has to be set properly.  (This will generally not   be an issue when running Django in &quot;test&quot; mode via ``runserver``.)   Django defaults to using ``same-origin``, but unless your static   content delivery also uses the same header, launching the streaming   window will fail.  You can set the header to ``same-origin-allow-popups``   inside ``settings.py`` to make this work, or ensure that your static   files set the proper header.  (Making sure static files use   ``Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`` just like Django will   do the trick.)  Setting the Django default can be done with::    SECURE_CROSS_ORIGIN_OPENER_POLICY = 'same-origin-allow-popups'   If your static content isn't served from the same protocol/hostname/port   as Django itself, you will likely have to set either Django or your   static files' value to ``unsafe-none`` instead.4. Include the exordium URLconf in your project ``urls.py`` like this::     path('exordium/', include('exordium.urls')),5. Run ``python manage.py migrate dynamic_preferences`` to create the   Dynamic Preferences models, if this wasn't already configured on your   Django install.6. Run ``python manage.py migrate exordium`` to create the Exordium models.7. Run ``python manage.py loaddata --app exordium initial_data`` to load   some initial data into the database.  *(This is not actually strictly   speaking necessary - the app will create the necessary data   automatically if it's not found.)*8. If running this from a &quot;real&quot; webserver, ensure that it's configured   to serve Django static files. Then run ``python manage.py collectstatic``   to get Exordium's static files in place.  If you didn't want to set   ``same-origin-allow-popups`` for Django's COOP header, make sure that   your server sends a ``Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`` header   along with these static files, or possibly ``unsafe-none`` if the   static files protocol/hostname/port doesn't match Django's.9. Either start the development server with ``python manage.py runserver``   or bring up your existing server.  Also ensure that you have a webserver   configured to allow access directly to your music library files, and    optionally to the zipfile downloads Exordium will create.10. Visit the administrative area in *Dynamic Preferences &gt; Global preferences*    and set the values for the following:    - **Exordium Library Base Path**: This is what defines where your music      library can be found on disk.    - **Exordium Media URL for HTML5**: This is the base URL which provides      direct access to the files in your library, used by the HTML streaming      player.  Omit the trailing slash, though things will probably work fine      even if it's in there.  Without this set properly, the streaming      player will not work properly.  Note that if your base URL for Exordium      is https, this will have to be https as well, to avoid browser errors.    - **Exordium Media URL for m3u**: This is the base URL which provides      direct access to the files in your library, used by the m3u Playlist      functionality, and also the direct song download links when enumerating      tracks.  This can be the same as the HTML5 URL.  Omit the slash, though      things will probably work fine even if it's in there.  Without this set      properly, m3u playlists and direct track downloads will not work      properly.  This URL can be http even if the main site is https.    - **Exordium Zip File Generation Path**: Path on the filesystem to store      zipfile album downloads.  This is the one location in which the user      running Django needs write access.    - **Exordium Zip File Retrieval URL**: This is the base URL providing      web access to that zipfile directory.  Note that if your base URL for      Exordium is https, this will have to be https as well, to avoid      browser errors.    Without the last two options, Exordium will still function fine, but the    album-download button will not be rendered.  Exordium will also function    without the &quot;*Exordium Media URL*&quot; options being set properly, though    with the caveats mentioned above.11. If Zipfile downloads are configured, a process should be put into place    to delete the zipfiles after a period of time.  I personally use a cronjob    to do this::      0 2 * * * /usr/bin/find /var/audio/exordiumzips -type f -name &quot;*.zip&quot; -mtime +2 -print -exec unzip -v {} \; -exec rm {} \;12. Visit the **Library Upkeep** link from the Exordium main page and click on    &quot;Start Process&quot; to begin the initial import into Exordium!</longdescription>

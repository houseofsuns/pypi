Read the code, its pretty simple &amp; self-explanatory  :)More information on x3270/s3270 can be found at:* http://x3270.bgp.nu/* http://x3270.bgp.nu/x3270-man.html* http://x3270.bgp.nu/s3270-man.html* http://x3270.bgp.nu/x3270-script.htmlQuestions &amp; Comments---------------------Please submit a issue or visit: http://groups.google.com/group/blazelibsCurrent Status---------------The interface seems sound, but the Emulator class has only basic functionality.There are more x3270 commands that the Emulator could have methods for. Thatbeing said, I believe most x3270 functionality can be supported at a lower-levelby the use of Emulator.exec_command().py3270 is installable via `pip` with ``pip install py3270`` or `easy_install`with ``easy_install py3270``... |license| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/License-BSD%203--Clause-blue.svg    :target: https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause    :alt: BSD-3-Clause.. |pypi| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/py3270.svg    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/py3270    :alt: Latest version released on PyPi.. |coverage| image:: https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=py3270&amp;metric=coverage    :target: https://sonarcloud.io/component_measures?id=py3270&amp;metric=coverage    :alt: Test coverage.. |bugs| image:: https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=py3270&amp;metric=bugs    :target: https://sonarcloud.io/component_measures?id=py3270&amp;metric=bugs    :alt: Bugs.. |code smells| image:: https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=py3270&amp;metric=code_smells    :target: https://sonarcloud.io/component_measures?id=py3270&amp;metric=code_smells    :alt: Code Smells.. |vulnerabilities| image:: https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=py3270&amp;metric=vulnerabilities    :target: https://sonarcloud.io/component_measures?id=py3270&amp;metric=vulnerabilities    :alt: Vulnerabilities.. |duplicated lines| image:: https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=py3270&amp;metric=duplicated_lines_density    :target: https://sonarcloud.io/component_measures?id=py3270&amp;metric=duplicated_lines_density    :alt: Duplicated Lines DensityChange Log----------0.3.5 released 2018-10-23============================- Added explicit license- Reorganizing project structure- Fix exception handling in sockets- Fix exception in terminate command (wc3270)- Code styling and minor fixes0.3.4 released 2017-07-24============================- Fix BrokenPipeError issue WRT Python 2.70.3.3 released 2016-01-21=========================- continued fix to broken version import (include version in manifest)0.3.2 released 2016-01-21=========================- fix broken version import in setup.py (broken in 0.3.0 and 0.3.1)0.3.1 released 2016-01-21=========================- fix testing support for Python 3- fix Windows support for Python 3- move to github, related updates to vcs-specific files0.3.0 released 2015-07-29=========================- Support Python 30.2.0 released 2014-03-28=========================- Add Windows support, but not tested thoroughly.Consider Windows supportExperimental.- use x3270 executables from PATH instead of requiring ExamBase to be subclassed- fix buffering problems when writing to x3270 subprocess0.1.5 released 2013-06-17=========================- changed default timeout to 30 seconds- added send_pf7(), send_pf8()0.1.4 released 2012-03-17=========================- added is_connected() method0.1.3 released 2011-12-06=========================- had messed up a previous upload to pypi releasing a fixed 0.1.1 as 0.1.2, so    need to go to next version number0.1.2 released 2011-12-06=========================- fix data parsing on Windows0.1.1 released 2011-12-05=========================- renamed Emulator to EmulatorBase to make it clearer that a subclass is needed- adjusted readme0.1.0 released 2011-12-01=========================- initial release</longdescription>

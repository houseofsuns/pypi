All documentation hosted by LTD is served through the `Fastly CDN &lt;https://www.fastly.com&gt;`_, which uses S3 object metadata to purge caches.  Conveyor ensures that this metadata is properly set by all clients and microservices that upload, copy, or delete objects from S3.  ``ltdconveyor.fastly`` provides Fastly cache management APIs.  ``ltdconveyor.keeper`` provides APIs for working with LTD Keeper's REST API.You can learn more about LTD in our `SQR-006 &lt;https://sqr-006.lsst.io&gt;`_ technote.**Read the docs:** https://ltd-conveyor.lsst.io##########Change log##########0.8.1 (2021-09-27)==================Fix parsing of the ``GITHUB_HEAD_REF`` environment variable in GitHub Actions.0.8.0 (2021-09-15)==================The ``ltd upload`` command now works in pull requests workflows on GitHub Actions.0.7.0 (2020-09-01)==================This release focuses on infrastructure improvements, and should not have a significant impact on users.Infrastructure--------------- This tool is officially tested and supported on Python 3.7 and 3.8.  Python 3.6 is no longer officially supported.- Removed pins on third-party dependencies, including boto3, requests, uritemplate, and click.  In doing so, LTD Conveyor is easier to integrate into your existing Python environment.- We have migrated from Travis CI to GitHub Actions for testing, linting, documentation builds and deployment, and deployments to PyPI.  In addition to on-demand testing, GitHub Actions tests the package on a daily basis to ensure compatibility with third-party dependencies.- Internally, we use tox for running tests, linters, and to build documentation.  tox makes it possible for local test runs to use the same set up as CI.- The codebase is now automatically formatted with black and isort.  By using pre-commit, we ensure that formatting is always applied.- The codebase now has type annotations, which are tested with mypy.  Type annotations help ensure that APIs are explicitly defined and correctly used.0.6.1 (2020-02-23)==================Fixed------ The ``--gh`` option for ``ltd upload`` now supports tag and PR events, in addition to branches.0.6.0 (2020-02-20)==================Added------ Added a ``--gh`` option to the ``ltd upload`` command to support usage in `GitHub Actions &lt;https://help.github.com/en/actions&gt;`__.0.5.0 (2020-02-05)==================Added------ LTD Conveyor can now upload new builds to S3 using Amazon's S3's presigned POST URL feature.  This means that clients no longer need credentials for S3 — the LTD Keeper API server generates presigned POST URLs as part of the ``POST /products/&lt;product&gt;/builds/`` build registration step.- The ``ltd`` command now uses the presigned POST-based URLs.  The ``--aws-id`` and ``--aws-secret`` options have been removed, but the ``--user`` and ``--password`` options remain.  If you use environment variables, there should be no change in how you use ``ltd upload`` (aside from not needing the ``$LTD_AWS_ID`` and ``$LTD_AWS_SECRET`` environment variables).Fixed------ In INFO-level and higher logging, the module path isn't displayed.  Module paths are only shown in DEBUG-level logging where it's most useful.Infrastructure--------------- Packaging is now done through a ``setup.cfg`` file and a ``pyproject.toml`` file (PEP 518).- Updated Travis CI configuration to test with Python 3.8; also refactored the CI Pipeline with Travis CI stages.0.4.2 (2018-10-09)==================Fixed------ Fixed a bug where ``ltdconveyor.s3.delete_dir``, since 0.4.1, would raise a ``TypeError`` while deleting an empty directory (no objects in the S3 prefix).0.4.1 (2018-10-08)==================Fixed------ Fixed a bug where ``ltdconveyor.s3.delete_dir`` would fail if there are more than 1000 objects under a path prefix that is being deleted.- Fixed title of the project in the documentation by updating to use a `Documenteer`_\ -based Sphinx set up.0.4.0 (2018-04-17)==================Added------ Added a new command-line app, ``ltd``, that provides subcommands for clients to work with the LSST the Docs API.  This app is implemented with Click_, and its documentation is automatically generated from the command-line help with `sphinx-click`_.  The first subcommand is ``ltd upload``, which lets a client upload a site to LTD as a new build.  This command includes special features for using the client from Travis CI (``ltd upload --travis`` option) to populate the version information from the Travis environment.  Other flags allow ``ltd upload`` to become a no-op under certain circumstances (for example, skip uploads on pull requests) or arbitrarily (set ``ltd upload --skip`` or ``export LTD_SKIP_UPLOAD=true``).  .. note::     With this feature, LTD Conveyor effectively deprecates `LTD Mason`_.     LTD Mason was the original uploader for LSST the Docs, but it was also designed around the idea of building the `LSST Science Pipelines` documentation as well (hence the term &quot;mason&quot;).     Over time, we realized it is better to have a general purpose client and uploader for LSST the Docs (LTD Conveyor) and a dedicated tool for assembling the multi-package Sphinx documentation site (`Documenteer`_).- Added the `ltdconveyor.keeper` subpackage that widens the scope of LTD Conveyor to be a full-service library for building LTD clients, not just an S3 upload client.  - The `ltdconveyor.keeper.login.get_keeper_token` function lets you obtain a temporary auth token for the LTD Keeper API.  - The `ltdconveyor.keeper.build` module includes functions for performing the build upload handshake with the LTD Keeper API.Changed-------- Removed Python 2.7 and 3.4 compatibility.  Now the codebase is entirely Python 3 (3.5, 3.6)-oriented.- Completely reorganized Python namespace.  Now all S3 APIs are in ``ltdconveyor.s3``.  Fastly APIs are available from ``ltdconveyor.fastly``.- Switched to using ``setuptools_scm`` to generate version strings for releases.- Switched to using ``extras_require`` for development dependencies (``pip install -e &quot;.[dev]&quot;``).  This lets us exclusively coordinate dependencies in ``setup.py``.- Enable testing via ``python setup.py test``.  Also upgrade the testing stack to ``pytest`` 3.5 and ``pytest-flake8`` 1.0.- Compatibility updates to the Sphinx documentation infrastructure.- Default to ``acl=None`` to support more AWS IAM users.  It turns out that not all IAM users with ``PutObject`` permissions also have permissions to set the ``ACL`` for an object.  We want to make it possible for many lightweight IAM users to upload to restricted sub-directories of the ``lsst-the-docs`` bucket, but it seems hard to make these users ACL grantees too.  We now seek an alternative:  - The ``lsst-the-docs`` bucket now has a PublicRead *bucket* policy  - No ACL is set on individual objects.Fixed------ Changed assertions to ``RuntimeErrors``.  Assertions shouldn't be used to raise exceptions in production code.0.3.1 (2017-03-27)==================Added------ Add ``open_bucket`` function.  This provides a convenient API for getting a boto3 bucket resource, particularly for clients that use the upload_object and upload_file APIs directly that take a bucket only.0.3.0 (2017-02-20)==================Added------ Added ``content_type`` parameter to ``upload_object`` so that a user can specify ``text/html`` for an HTML upload.  The ``upload_file``/``upload_dir`` functions avoid this problem by using Python's ``mimetypes`` library to guess the encoding, but ``upload_object`` is lower-level and warrants having the user explicitly provide the content type.- Refactored new function ``create_dir_redirect_object``.  This code used to be inside ``upload_dir``, but in `LTD Dasher`_ it seems necessary to upload files one at a time, and thus it's necessary to directly create these directory redirect objects.Fixed------ Fix issue where ``'..'`` shows up in directory names (seen when doing ``upload_dir`` with `LTD Dasher`_ asset directories).0.2.0 (2017-02-02)==================Added------ Ported Fastly ``purge_key`` function from `LTD Keeper`_.  Any LTD application that uploads objects to S3 might also need to purge Fastly CDN caches.  This purge capability is presented as a simple function.0.1.0 (2017-01-25)==================Added------ Port S3 codebase from `LTD Mason`_.  The purpose of LTD Conveyor is to provide a set of common S3 APIs that can be used from both client (uploading docs from CI) and server (`LTD Keeper`_) settings... _LTD Keeper: https://ltd-keeper.lsst.io.. _LTD Mason: https://ltd-mason.lsst.io.. _LTD Dasher: https://github.com/lsst-sqre/ltd-dasher.. _Documenteer: https://documenteer.lsst.io.. _Click: http://click.pocoo.org/.. _sphinx-click: https://sphinx-click.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.. _LSST Science Pipelines: https://pipelines.lsst.ioMIT LicenseCopyright 2016-2020 Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc.

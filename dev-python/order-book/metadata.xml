Installing from source will require a compiler and can be done with setuptools: `python setup.py install`. ### Running code coverageThe script `coverage.sh` will compile the source using the `-coverage` `CFLAG`, run the unit tests, and build a coverage report in HTML. The script uses tools that may need to be installed (coverage, lcov, genhtml).### Running the performance testsYou can run the performance tests like so: `python perf/performance_test.py`. The program will profile the time to run for random data samples of various sizes as well as the construction of a sorted orderbook using live L2 orderbook data from Coinbase.The performance of constructing a sorted orderbook (using live data from Coinbase) using this C library, versus a pure Python sorted dictionary library:| Library        | Time, in seconds || ---------------| ---------------- || C Library      | 0.00021767616271 || Python Library | 0.00043988227844 |The performance of constructing sorted dictionaries using the same libraries, as well as the cost of building unsorted, python dictionaies for dictionaries of random floating point data:| Library        | Number of Keys | Time, in seconds || -------------- | -------------- | ---------------- || C Library      |     100        | 0.00021600723266 || Python Library |     100        | 0.00044703483581 || Python Dict    |     100        | 0.00022006034851 || C Library      |     500        | 0.00103306770324 || Python Library |     500        | 0.00222206115722 || Python Dict    |     500        | 0.00097918510437 || C Library      |     1000       | 0.00202703475952 || Python Library |     1000       | 0.00423812866210 || Python Dict    |     1000       | 0.00176715850830 |This represents a roughly 2x speedup compared to a pure python implementation, and in many cases is close to the performance of an unsorted python dictionary.For other performance metrics, run `performance_test.py` as well as the other performance tests in [`perf/`](perf/)----## Changelog### 0.6.0 (2022-10-19) * Update: Drop support for python 3.7 * Feature: to_list method * Bugfix: Initialize iterator correctly### 0.5.0 (2022-08-23) * Bugfix: fix segmentation fault when calculating checksum on empty orderbook * Bugfix: fix missing reference decrement * Performance: Improvement to marking dirty keys### 0.4.3 (2022-05-29) * Bugfix: handle scientific notation of small values in Kraken checksum * Update: calculate Kraken checksum on order books less than 10 levels deep * Bugfix: fix occasional incorrect checksums for OKX, FTX and Bitget### 0.4.2 (2022-04-17) * Update: OKEx renamed OKX (for checksum validation) * Feature: Add support for orderbook checksums with Bitget### 0.4.1 (2021-10-12) * Bugfix: unnecessary reference counting prevented sorted dictionaries from being deallocated * Bugfix: setting ordering on a sorted dict before checking that it was created successfully### 0.4.0 (2021-09-16) * Feature: changes to code and setup.py to enable compiling on windows * Feature: add from_type/to_type kwargs to the to_dict methods, allowing for type conversion when creating the dictionary### 0.3.2 (2021-09-04) * Bugfix: depth was incorrectly ignored when converting sorteddict to python dict### 0.3.1 (2021-09-01)  * Bugfix: truncate and max_depth not being passed from orderbook to sorteddict object correctly  * Feature: let checksum_format kwarg be set to None### 0.3.0 (2021-07-16)  * Update classifiers to indicate this projects only supports MacOS/Linux  * Bugfix: Using less than the minimum number of levels for a checksum with Kraken not raising error correctly  * Update: add del examples to test code### 0.2.1 (2021-03-29)  * Bugfix: Invalid deallocation of python object### 0.2.0 (2021-03-12)  * Feature: Add branch prediction hints around error handling code  * Bugfix: Fix regression from adding branch predictors  * Bugfix: Fix error corner case when iterating twice on an empty dataset  * Feature: Add contains function for membership test  * Bugfix: Fix issues around storing L3 data  * Feature: Enhance testing, add in L3 book test cases### 0.1.1 (2021-02-12)  * Feature: Checksum support for orderbooks  * Feature: FTX checksum support  * Feature: Kraken checksum support  * Feature: OkEX/OKCoin checksum support  * Perf: Use CRC32 table to improve performance of checksum code### 0.1.0 (2021-01-18)  * Minor: Use enums to make code more readable  * Bugfix: Add manifest file to ensure headers and changes file are included in sdist builds  * Feature: Add support for max depth and depth truncation### 0.0.2 (2020-12-27)  * Bugfix: Fix sorted dictionary arg parsing  * Feature: Coverage report generation for C library  * Bugfix: Fix reference counting in index method in SortedDict  * Feature: New unit tests to improve SortedDict coverage  * Feature: Modularize files  * Feature: Add ability to set bids/asks to dictionaries via attributes or \[ \]  * Docs: Update README with simple usage example### 0.0.1 (2020-12-26)  * Initial Release</longdescription>

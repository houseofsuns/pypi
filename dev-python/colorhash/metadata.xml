	<longdescription># color-hash**Generate a color based on a value**This module generates a color based on an object, by calculating a color valuebased on a hash value for the object. This means the result is deterministic:the same value will always result in the same color (so long as the hashfunction remains deterministic).This module is a port of the [color-hash Javascript library](https://github.com/zenozeng/color-hash).It supports Python 3.7+ and it has no dependencies.## Quick Start```python&gt;&gt;&gt; from colorhash import ColorHash&gt;&gt;&gt; c = ColorHash('Hello World')&gt;&gt;&gt; c.hsl(131, 0.65, 0.5)&gt;&gt;&gt; c.rgb(45, 210, 75)&gt;&gt;&gt; c.hex'#2dd24b'```## InstallationIts hosted on PyPI.```bashpip install colorhash```## Changelog- color-hash **1.3.1** *(2023-09-21)*  - 🐛 Handle missing `importlib-metadata` import- color-hash **1.3.0** *(2023-09-20)*  - 🧑💻 Add `py.typed` to support type annotations (#4)  - 📦 Changed packaging ecosystem    - ➖ Remove `poetry`    - ➖ Remove `tox`    - ➕ Add `pip-tools` (manage dependencies)    - ➕ Add `hatch` (build &amp; test)    - ➕ Add `twine` (publish)  - ✨ Support `python3.11`  - ⚰️ Drop support for `python3.6`- color-hash **1.2.2** *(2022-10-17)*  - ✨ Add publish helper script- color-hash **1.2.1** *(2022-10-17)*  - 📝 Update docs- color-hash **1.2.0** *(2022-10-17)*  - 🧑💻 Use typing supporting `python3.6`- color-hash **1.1.0** *(2022-09-01)*  - ✅ Add tests  - 🚸 Add installation instructions- color-hash **1.0.4** *(2021-11-30)*  - Support only for `python3.6+`  - ✅ Add tests- color-hash **1.0.3** *(2020-12-04)*  - ⚰️ Drop support for `python2.x`  - 🎉 Handover of project maintenance- color-hash **1.0.2** *(2016-07-08)*  - ✨ Add ``crc32_hash`` function and set default hashfunc to that. It's not    fully backwards-compatible, but I don't want to bump the version a lot for    not doing my research.- color-hash **1.0.0** *(2016-07-07)*  - 🎉 Initial port.## LicenseCopyright (c) 2016 Felix Krull &lt;f_krull@gmx.de&gt;This is a port of the 'color-hash' Javascript library which is:Copyright (c) 2015 Zeno ZengPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy ofthis software and associated documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to deal inthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights touse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies ofthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,subject to the following conditions:The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in allcopies or substantial portions of the Software.THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS ORIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESSFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

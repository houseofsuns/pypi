	<longdescription>A pytest plugin for multi-host testing.Downloading-----------Release tarballs will be made available for download from Pagure Releases:    https://pagure.io/releases/python-pytest-multihost/The goal is to include this project in Fedora repositories. Until that happens,you can use testing builds from COPR – see &quot;Developer links&quot; below.You can also install using pip:    https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-multihostUsage-----This plugin takes a description of your infrastructure,and provides, via a fixture, Host objects that commands can be called on.It is intended as a general base for a framework; any project using it willneed to extend it for its own needs.The object provided to tests is a Config object, which has (among others)these attributes::    test_dir – directory to store test-specific data in,               defaults to /root/multihost_tests    ipv6 – true if connecting via IPv6    domains – the list of domainsHosts to run on are arranged in domains, which have::    name – the DNS name of the domain    type – a string specifying the type of the domain ('default' by default)    config – the Config this domain is part of    hosts – list of hosts in this domainAnd the hosts have::    role – type of this host; should encode the OS and installed packages    hostname – fully qualified hostname, usually reachable from other hosts    shortname – first component of hostname    external_hostname – hostname used to connect to this host    ip – IP address    domain – the Domain this host is part of    transport – allows operations like uploading and downloading files    run_command() – runs the given command on the hostFor each object – Config, Domain, Host – one can provide subclassesto modify the behavior (for example, FreeIPA would add Host methodsto run a LDAP query or to install an IPA server).Each object has from_dict and to_dict methods, which can add additionalattributes – for example, Config.ntp_server.To use the multihost plugin in tests, create a fixture listing the domainsand what number of which host role is needed::    import pytest    from pytest_multihost import make_multihost_fixture    @pytest.fixture(scope='class')    def multihost(request):        mh = make_multihost_fixture(            request,            descriptions=[                {                    'type': 'ipa',                    'hosts': {                        'master': 1,                        'replica': 2,                    },                },            ],        )        return mhIf not enough hosts are available, all tests that use the fixture are skipped.The object returned from ``make_multihost_fixture`` only has the &quot;config&quot;attribute.Users are expected to add convenience attributes.For example, FreeIPA, which typically uses a single domain with one master,several replicas and some clients, would do::    from pytest_multihost import make_multihost_fixture    @pytest.fixture(scope='class')    def multihost(request):        mh = make_multihost_fixture(request, descriptions=[                {                    'type': 'ipa',                    'hosts': {                        'master': 1,                        'replica': 1,                        'client': 1,                    },                },            ],        )        # Set convenience attributes        mh.domain = mh.config.domains[0]        [mh.master] = mh.domain.hosts_by_role('master')        mh.replicas = mh.domain.hosts_by_role('replica')        mh.clients = mh.domain.hosts_by_role('client')        # IPA-specific initialization/teardown of the hosts        request.cls().install(mh)        request.addfinalizer(lambda: request.cls().uninstall(mh))        # Return the fixture        return mhAs with any pytest fixture, this can be used by getting it asa function argument.For a simplified example, FreeIPA usage could look something like this::    class TestMultihost(object):        def install(self, multihost):            multihost.master.run_command(['ipa-server-install'])        def uninstall(self, multihost):            multihost.master.run_command(['ipa-server-install', '--uninstall'])        def test_installed(self, multihost):            multihost.master.run_command(['ipa', 'ping'])The description of infrastructure is provided in a JSON or YAML file,which is named on the py.test command line. For example::    ssh_key_filename: ~/.ssh/id_rsa    domains:      - name: adomain.test        type: test-a        hosts:          - name: master            ip: 192.0.2.1            role: master          - name: replica1            ip: 192.0.2.2            role: replica          - name: replica2            ip: 192.0.2.3            role: replica            external_hostname: r2.adomain.test          - name: client1            ip: 192.0.2.4            role: client          - name: extra            ip: 192.0.2.6            role: extrarole      - name: bdomain.test        type: test-b        hosts:          - name: master.bdomain.test            ip='192.0.2.65            role: master$ py.test --multihost-config=/path/to/configfile.yamlTo use YAML files, the PyYAML package is required. Without it only JSON filescan be used.Encoding and bytes/text-----------------------When writing files or issuing commands, bytestrings are passed throughunchanged, and text strings (``unicode`` in Python 2) are encoded usinga configurable encoding (``utf-8`` by default).When reading files, bytestrings are returned by default,but an encoding can be given to get a test string.For command output, separate ``stdout_bytes`` and ``stdout_text`` attributesare provided.The latter uses a configurable encoding (``utf-8`` by default).Contributing------------The project is happy to accept patches!Please file any patches as Pull Requests on the project's `Pagure repo`_.Any development discussion should be in Pagure Pull Requests and Issues.Developer links---------------  * Bug tracker: https://pagure.io/python-pytest-multihost/issues  * Code browser: https://pagure.io/python-pytest-multihost/tree/master  * git clone https://pagure.io/python-pytest-multihost.git  * Unstable packages for Fedora: https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/pviktori/pytest-plugins/To release, update version in setup.py, add a Git tag like &quot;v0.3&quot;,and run `make tarball`.Running `make upload` will put the tarball to Fedora Hosted and PyPI,and a SRPM on Fedorapeople, if you have the rights.Running `make release` will upload and fire a COPR build... _Pagure repo: https://pagure.io/python-pytest-multihost</longdescription>

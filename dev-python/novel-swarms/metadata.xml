	<longdescription># Novel Behavior Discovery in Computation Free SwarmsContributors: Connor Mattson, Jeremy Clark, Daniel S. Brown## Required Software- Python &amp; Pip- External Python Packages as defined in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) ## SetupInstall Python Packages        pip install -r requirements.txtTest Simulation    python -m demo.simulation.cyclic_pursuitTest Evolution (Novelty Search) - Will take a long time to evolve.    python -m demo.evolution.novelty_searchYou're good to go![//]: # (## Use as Package)[//]: # (You can now install this repository as a pip package under the name novel_swarms==0.0.1)[//]: # ()[//]: # (    pip install --upgrade git+ssh://git@github.com/Connor-Mattson/NovelSwarmBehavior.git@master)## Demos### SimulationAll 6 emergent behaviors defined in Brown et al. are available for simulation from the command line.    python -m demo.simulation.cyclic_pursuit    python -m demo.simulation.aggregation    python -m demo.simulation.dispersal    python -m demo.simulation.milling    python -m demo.simulation.wall_following    python -m demo.simulation.randomTo alter world, agent, and sensor settings, modify the configurations in the [Simulation Playground](demo/simulation/playground.py)    # Edit /demo/simulation/playground.py first    python -m demo.simulation.playground### EvolutionUse the following command to replicate the results shown in Brown et al.    python -m demo.evolution.novelty_searchIf you want to modify the parameters for evolution, use the [Evolution Playground](demo/evolution/playground.py)    # Edit /demo/evolution/playground.py first    python -m demo.evolution.playgroundEvolving behaviors takes a long time, especially as the number of agents and lifespan increase. To save results in the [Output Folder](out/), set `save_archive = True` in the GeneticEvolutionConfig class instatiated in the evolution playground.    GeneticEvolutionConfig(        ...        save_archive=True    )The resulting genotype (controller archive) and phenotype (behavior vector archive) files are saved to the output folder with the names `geno_g{genome_length}_gen{n_generations}_pop{population_size}_{timestamp}.csv` and `pheno_g{genome_length}_gen{n_generations}_pop{population_size}_{timestamp}.csv`.### ResultsIf you have results saved to /out (see above section), modify [/demo/results/results_from_file.py](/demo/results/results_from_file.py) with the path to your files (relative to /out)    archive = NoveltyArchive(        pheno_file=&quot;PHENOTYPE_FILE&quot;,    # Replace with your file        geno_file=&quot;GENOTYPE_FILE&quot;       # Replace with your file    )Then run    python -m demo.results.results_from_fileThis will allow you to explore the reduced behavior space that you generated from an earlier evolution execution.You can also use your pheno and geno files for plotting behaviors/controllers over time, as all entries are saved to the archives in order.## ConfigurationAs part of our desire to make a framework that can easily be tweaked and expanded, much of the blackbox details are hidden behinds the scenes (in the /src folder).Use the common configuration interfaces to modify common parameters that do not require a complex knowledge of the codebase.    from src.novelty.GeneRule import GeneRule    from src.novelty.evolve import main as evolve    from src.results.results import main as report    from src.config.WorldConfig import RectangularWorldConfig    from src.config.defaults import ConfigurationDefaults    from src.config.EvolutionaryConfig import GeneticEvolutionConfig    # Use the default Differential Drive Agent, initialized with a single sensor and normal physics    agent_config = ConfigurationDefaults.DIFF_DRIVE_AGENT    # Create a Genotype Ruleset that matches the size and boundaries of your robot controller _max and _min represent    # the maximum and minimum acceptable values for that index in the genome. mutation_step specifies the largest    # possible step in any direction that the genome can experience during mutation.    genotype = [        GeneRuleContinuous(_max=1.0, _min=-1.0, mutation_step=0.4, round_digits=4),        GeneRuleContinuous(_max=1.0, _min=-1.0, mutation_step=0.4, round_digits=4),        GeneRuleContinuous(_max=1.0, _min=-1.0, mutation_step=0.4, round_digits=4),        GeneRuleContinuous(_max=1.0, _min=-1.0, mutation_step=0.4, round_digits=4),    ]    # Use the default Behavior Vector (from Brown et al.) to measure the collective swarm behaviors    phenotype = ConfigurationDefaults.BEHAVIOR_VECTOR    # Define an empty Rectangular World with size (w, h) and n agents.    world_config = RectangularWorldConfig(        size=(500, 500),        n_agents=30,        behavior=phenotype,        agentConfig=agent_config,        padding=15    )    # Define the breath and depth of novelty search with n_generations and n_populations    # Modify k_nn to change the number of nearest neighbors used in calculating novelty.    # Increase simulation_lifespan to allow agents to interact with each other for longer.    # Set save_archive to True to save the resulting archive to /out.    novelty_config = GeneticEvolutionConfig(        gene_rules=genotype,        phenotype_config=phenotype,        n_generations=100,        n_population=100,        crossover_rate=0.7,        mutation_rate=0.15,        world_config=world_config,        k_nn=15,        simulation_lifespan=300,        display_novelty=False,        save_archive=False,    )    # Novelty Search through Genetic Evolution    archive = evolve(config=novelty_config)    results_config = ConfigurationDefaults.RESULTS    results_config.world = world_config    results_config.archive = archive    # Take Results from Evolution, reduce dimensionality, and present User with Clusters.    report(config=results_config)## AugmentationWe have explored the idea of augmenting this framework further to allow more complex world, sensor, controller, and actuator spaces. Much of the backbone to support these augmentations is present in this codebase, but lacks testing and robustness.We invite you to augment cautiously and carefully test output validity.</longdescription>

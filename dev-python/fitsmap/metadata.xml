Examining images of this size can be difficult, especially in multiplebands. Memory constraints and highly specialized tools like DS9 can make simplehigh-level analysis infeasible or cumbersome. FitsMap addresses these two issuesby converting large fits files and images into tiles that can be presented using`LeafletJS &lt;https://leafletjs.com&gt;`_. Another issue in examining survey imagesis examining a catalog of sources in the context of the images. FitsMapaddresses this by converting a catalog of sources into JSON map markers, whichcan be viewed in the webpage. Additionally, these sources are searchable usingthe web interface by the column ``id``.Some sample websites that leverage FitsMap are:- `DREaM Galaxy Catalogs &lt;https://purl.org/fitsmap/dream&gt;`_ `(Drakos, et al., 2022) &lt;https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac46fb&gt;`_- `Morpheus &lt;https://purl.org/fitsmap/morpheus&gt;`_ `(Hausen &amp; Robertson 2020) &lt;https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ab8868&gt;`_Additional examples are welcome! If you'd like to add your use case here, submitan issue with the title &quot;Use Case Example&quot;, and in the description, include theURL to the FitsMap along with a title and also a link to an associated paper ifyou'd like.Here is an example using FitsMap to render a 32,727² image and ~33 millionsources from the `DReAM Galaxy Catalog &lt;https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10703&gt;`_:.. image:: docs/dream_map.gif    :alt: FitsMap    :align: centerInstallation************Requirements:- ``astropy``- ``cbor2``- ``click``- ``mapbox_vector_tile``- ``matplotlib``- ``numpy``- ``pillow``- ``scikit-image``- ``ray``- ``tqdm``Use ``pip`` to install.. code-block:: bash    pip install fitsmapUsage*****FitsMap is designed to address the following example. A user has multiple FITSfiles or PNG files that represent multiple bands of the same area of the sky,along with a catalog of sources within that area. For example, the directorymight look like:.. code-block::  - path/to/data/    - F125W.fits    - F160W.fits    - RGB.png    - catalog.catThere are two FITS files (``F125W.fits``, ``F160W.fits``), a PNG file(``RGB.png``), and catalog (``catalog.cat``) containing sources visible in theimage files. To render these files using FitsMap you can use|dir_to_map| or |files_to_map|.After the FitsMap has been generated you can view it in your web browser bynavigating to the directory containing the map (``index.html``) and running thefollowing command in the terminal:.. code-block:: bash    fitsmap serveThis will start up a webserver and open your browser to the page containing themap. When your done with the map you can close your browser window and kill theprocess running in the terminal.``dir_to_map``--------------To convert this directory into a FitsMap using |dir_to_map|:.. code-block:: python    from fitsmap import convert    convert.dir_to_map.(        &quot;path/to/data&quot;,        out_dir=&quot;path/to/data/map&quot;,        cat_wcs_fits_file=&quot;path/to/data/F125W.fits&quot;,        norm_kwargs=dict(stretch=&quot;log&quot;, max_percent=99.5),    )The first argument is which directory contains the files that we would like toconvert into a map. In our case, this is ``path/to/dir``.  The next argument isthe ``out_dir`` keyword argument that tells FitsMap where to put the generatedwebpage and supporting directories. In this example, the website will be builtin a new subdirectory called ``map`` within ``path/to/data``. The argument``cat_wcs_fits_file`` keyword argument tells FitsMap which header to use toparse any catalog files and convert them into map markers. The ``norm_kwargs``argument should be a dictionary of kwargs that get passed to`astropy.visulization.simple_norm&lt;https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.visualization.mpl_normalize.simple_norm.html&gt;`_which is used to scale the FITS files before rendering.Equivalently, using the FitsMap command line interface:.. code-block::  fitsmap dir --out_dir /path/to/data/map \              --cat_wcs_fits_file &quot;path/to/header_file.fits&quot; \              path/to/data**Note:** The command line interface doesn't currently support ``norm_kwargs``.Run ``fitsmap --help`` for more informationOnce FitsMap is finished, the following will have been generated:.. code-block::  - path/to/data/map/    - F125W/    - F160W/    - RGB/    - catalog/    - css/    - catalog_assets/    - imgs/    - js/    - index.htmlThe directories ``F125W``, ``F160W``, ``RGB``, ``catalog`` contain tiledversions of the input fits files. The ``css`` directory contains some supportingCSS files for clustering the markers and rendering pixels. The ``imgs``directory contains supporting images. The ``js`` directory contains supportingJavaScript for the map. ``catalog_assets`` contains JSON files for each sourcein each that are rendered when the marker associated with that source isclicked. Finally, ``index.html`` is the webpage that contains the map.To use the map, run ``fitsmap serve`` in the same directory as ``index.html````files_to_map``----------------If you want to specify the files that get used to generate the map you can usefunction |files_to_map|:.. code-block:: python    from fitsmap import convert    paths_to_files = [        ...,    ]    convert.files_to_map.(        paths_to_files,        out_dir=&quot;path/to/data/map&quot;,        cat_wcs_fits_file=&quot;path/to/header_file.fits&quot;,        norm_kwargs=dict(stretch=&quot;log&quot;, max_percent=99.5),    )This will produce a map in ``out_dir`` using the files that were passed in usingthe ``paths_to_files`` variable.File Specific ``norm_kwargs``-----------------------------The ``norm_kwargs`` argument to |dir_to_map| and |files_to_map| can be adictionary of kwargs where the keys are the filenames (not paths) and the valuesare the ``simple_norm`` kwargs for that file. For example:.. code-block:: python    from fitsmap import convert    paths_to_files = [        &quot;fits_images/F125W.fits&quot;,        &quot;fits_images/F160W.fits&quot;,    ]    convert.files_to_map.(        paths_to_files,        out_dir=&quot;path/to/data/map&quot;,        cat_wcs_fits_file=&quot;path/to/header_file.fits&quot;,        norm_kwargs={            &quot;F125W.fits&quot;:dict(stretch=&quot;log&quot;, max_percent=99.5),            &quot;F160W.fits&quot;:dict(stretch=&quot;log&quot;, max_percent=99.9, min_percent=0.1),        }    )Saveable Views**************FitsMap stores the current view (location/zoom) in the url. You can thenshare the view with others by sharing the url.Search**************You can search the catalogs by the ``id`` column from the catalog and FitsMapwill locate and pan to the source in the map.Parallelization**********************************FitsMap supports the parallelization(via `ray &lt;ray.io&gt;`_) of map creation in twoways:- splitting images/catalogs into parallel tasks- parallel tiling of an image- parallel reading/tiling of a catalogThe settings for parallelization are set using the following keyword arguments:- ``procs_per_task``: Sets how many layers/catalogs to convert in parallel at a  time.- ``task_procs``: How many processes can work on a single task.You can use both keyword arguments at the same time, but keep in mind the numberof CPUs available. For example, if ``procs_per_task=2`` and ``task_procs=2``then that will generate 6 new processes, 2 new processes for each task, and eachof those will generate 2 new processes to tile an image in parallel.Parallelization can offer a significant speed up, so if there are cores availableit makes sense to use them.**NOTE: ray's support for Windows is currently in beta, so you may experiencesome bugs running in parallel on Windows machines. Feel free to submit an issueif you run into any problems.**Notes*****Notes on Image Conversion-------------------------FITS images are rendered into PNG map tiles using Matplotlib colormaps. Thedefault colormap used when rendering tiles is &quot;gray&quot;. This can be changed bysetting the value of ``convert.MPL_CMAP`` to any valid `Matplotlib colormap&lt;https://matplotlib.org/3.1.0/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html&gt;`_.To ensure that pixels are rendered correctly and that map markers are placedcorrectly, any image that is not square is squared by padding the array with NaNvalues that are converted into transparent pixels in the PNG. As a consequence,if a FITS file contains NaNs when it is converted, those pixels will beconverted into transparent pixels.Notes on Catalog Conversion---------------------------Catalogs should be delimited text files with the first line containing thecolumn names, and the following lines containing values. Catalogs need to havean ``id`` column with a unique value for each row. It also needs to havecoordinates for each source, which can be one of the following pairs of columns(``ra`` / ``dec``) or (``x`` / ``y``). **Note fitsmap assumes that the origin ofthe image starts at (1,1), but this can be changed to (0,0) by setting thekwarg** ``catalog_starts_at_one=False``.Some catalogs have many columns for each row, which will create very tallpop-ups when the markers are clicked. To avoid this, you can pass an integervalue using ``rows_per_column`` to either |dir_to_map| or |files_to_map|. Thiswill break the information into ``rows_per_column`` sized columns.Catalog pop-ups are rendered as a simple HTML table, so you can put any HTMLfriendly things, for example &lt;img&gt; tags, in the catalog and they should berendered appropriately.FitsMap will render your markers as Ellipses if you have the following columnsin your catalog: ``a``, ``b``, and ``theta``. Where ``a`` is the major axisradius in **pixels**, ``b`` is the minor axis radius in **pixels**, and thetais the rotation of the ellipse in units of degrees starting from the negativex-axis and moving counter-clockwise... image:: docs/ellipse_fig.png    :alt: EllipseOrientaton    :align: center----If you use FitsMap in your research please cite it using the following (also in`CITE.bib &lt;https://github.com/ryanhausen/fitsmap/blob/master/CITE.bib&gt;`_):.. code-block::    @article{hausen2022a,         title = {FitsMap: A simple, lightweight tool for displaying interactive astronomical image and catalog data},       journal = {Astronomy and Computing},        volume = {39},         pages = {100586},          year = {2022},          issn = {2213-1337},           doi = {https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ascom.2022.100586},           url = {https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213133722000257},        author = {R.

As the scale of astronomical image and catalog data continues to grow, visualizing the data becomes increasingly difficult. In this work, we introduce FitsMap, a simple, lightweight tool for visualizing astronomical image and catalog data. FitsMap uses well-understood image tiling techniques and a novel catalog tiling technique to serve gigapixel images with catalogs containing tens of millions of sources using only a simple web server. Further, the web-based visualizations can be viewed performantly on mobile devices. FitsMap is implemented in Python and is open source (https://github.com/ryanhausen/fitsmap).}    }For more information see the `docs &lt;https://fitsmap.readthedocs.io&gt;`__or the `code &lt;https://github.com/ryanhausen/fitsmap&gt;`__.</longdescription>

This caused carashed in SEAMM, which this fixes until MOPAC can be    corrected.    2023.4.24 -- Bugfixes for Lewis structure  * Correctly handle periodic systems in Lewis structure.  * Fixed and issue with the Lewis structure GUI not displaying all the widgets.    2023.3.31 -- Bugfix  Lewis structure could reference a variable before it was set, and crash.  2023.3.15 -- Bugfix  A copy of the input and output files for MOPAC was inadvertently written to the main  job directory. This has been fixed.  2023.2.13 -- Added Lewis Structure step  Provide access to the 'LEWIS' keyword in MOPAC for generating the Lewis dot  structure. This step also allows assigning the bonds of the system using either the  connectivity or the Lewis structure.  2022.11.18 -- Printing spins on atoms  Fixed an oversight that preventing printing spins on the atoms, and storing them on  the structure. Also increased the precision of the AUX file so have coordinates to  seven decimals, which should maintain symmetry better.  2022.11.4 -- Added ForceConstant substep  Calculates and writes the Hessian (force constant) matrix to disk. Works for both  molecular and periodic systems, and provides an option to control which parts of the  Hessian matrix are written. Defaults to the full matrix. Also provides options to  control the units of the output, with default of N/m for the atom block of the  Hessian as well as the atom-cell off-diagonal block, and GPa for the cell block.2021.2.11 (11 February 2021)----------------------------* Updated the README file to give a better description.* Updated the short description in setup.py to work with the new installer.* Added keywords for better searchability.2021.2.4 (4 February 2021)--------------------------* Updated for compatibility with the new system classes in MolSystem  2021.2.2 release.2020.12.5 (5 December 2020)---------------------------* Internal: switching CI from TravisCI to GitHub Actions, and in the  process moving documentation from ReadTheDocs to GitHub Pages where  it is consolidated with the main SEAMM documentation.2020.11.2 (2 November 2020)---------------------------* Updated to be compatible with the new command-line argument  handling.2020.10.7 (7 October 2020)----------------------------* Updated to handle citations using the new framework.2020.9.29 (29 September 2020)-----------------------------* Updated to be compatible with the new system classes in MolSystem.2020.8.1 (1 August 2020)------------------------* Fixed bug caused by coordinates being strings, not numbers, in some  cases.2020.7.0 (23 July 2020)-----------------------* Improved the text output when running.0.9 (15 April 2020)-------------------* General bug fixes and cleanup of the code.0.7.0 (17 December 2019)------------------------* Consolidating minor changes and making a uniform release at year's  end.0.5.1 (29 August 2019)----------------------* First version that runs correctly and generates output.0.2.0 (13 August 2019)----------------------* First release on PyPI.</longdescription>

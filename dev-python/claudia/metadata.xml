	<longdescription># ClaudiaClaudia is a tool which helps make a few XRPL specific tasks look very easy. Tasks like running a local instance ofrippled, managing a local network, managing a sidechain network, running tests and even learning a few neat tricks withXRPL in a quick fashion can be done effortlessly with this tool.Claudia was developed by the XRPL Automation Team as an internal tool to help with XRPL local development, debugging andtesting. As the tool matured, the team quickly realized its potential and decided to expose it outside of Ripple, sothat everyone can benefit from its capabilities.Following are some of the important tasks that can be performed using Claudia:- Build rippled from local code.- Install rippled from pre-built binaries released by Ripple.- Manage a local-mainnet network using local rippled instance.- Locally build a local witness server to start a sidechain network.- Manage a local-sidechain network.- Run unit tests on the built/installed rippled instance.- Run system tests on local-mainnet, local-sidechain, devnet and testnet networks.- Manage rippled features on the local-mainnet and local-sidechain networks.- Learn more about XRPL capabilities and perform real-time learning activities on local-mainnet, local-sidechain, devnet  and testnet networks.---## General PrerequisitesClaudia can be installed on both macOS and Ubuntu.

You will need toclone [XBridge Witness](https://github.com/seelabs/xbridge_witness) repository first before starting on this step. Oncethe repository has been cloned, you can build the witness server as follows. Each option would require you to providethe absolute path to the cloned repository.- UI    - Navigate to `Custom XRPL Networks` and select `Build Witness Server`- CLI Mode    - Run `claudia witness build --repo &lt;repo_path&gt;`- Demo Mode    - Select `Custom XRPL Networks` -&gt; `Build witness server`### How to deploy custom network to AWS?You can use Claudia to spin up a custom network on your AWS cloud infrastructure. This option is only supported via UI. Navigate to `Custom XRPL Networks` and select `Deploy Network to Cloud`. You will be asked to provide the following information: * AWS IAM user access key* AWS IAM user secret access key* RegionClaudia runs each a validator node on a separate EC2 instance. At least two validator nodes are required to spin up a network.You can choose to run up to 10 validator nodes running the rippled variant built using the latest master branch code. Similarly, you can choose to run up to 10 validator nodes running the rippled variant built using the latest release anddevelop branches code each. This way you can run up to 30 validator nodes running three different rippled variants.The deployment process takes a while. Once finished, the details will be provided along with the connection URLs.### How to start a local-mainnet network?Before you can start a local mainnet network, rippled has to be built or installed locally.

James, Monte Carlo Phase Space, CERN 68-15 (1968).. _JOSS: https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01570.. _Gitter: https://gitter.im/zfit/phasespaceWhy?====Lately, data analysis in High Energy Physics (HEP), traditionally performed within the `ROOT`_ ecosystem,has been moving more and more towards Python.The possibility of carrying out purely Python-based analyses has become real thanks to thedevelopment of many open source Python packages,which have allowed to replace most ROOT functionality with Python-based packages.One of the aspects where this is still not possible is in the random generation of `n`-body phase space events,which are widely used in the field, for example to study kinematicsof the particle decays of interest, or to perform importance sampling in the case of complex amplitude models.This has been traditionally done with the `TGenPhaseSpace`_ class, which is based of the GENBOD function of theCERNLIB FORTRAN libraries and which requires a full working ROOT installation.This package aims to address this issue by providing a TensorFlow-based implementation of such a functionto generate `n`-body decays without requiring a ROOT installation.Additionally, an oft-needed functionality to generate complex decay chains, not included in ``TGenPhaseSpace``,is also offered, leaving room for decaying resonances (which don't have a fixed mass, but can be seen as abroad peak)... _ROOT: https://root.cern.ch.. _TGenPhaseSpace: https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTGenPhaseSpace.htmlInstalling==========To install with pip:.. code-block:: console    $ pip install phasespaceThis is the preferred method to install ``phasespace``, as it will always install the most recent stable release.To install the necessary dependencies to be used with`DecayLanguage &lt;https://github.com/scikit-hep/decaylanguage&gt;`_, use.. code-block:: console    $ pip install &quot;phasespace[fromdecay]&quot;How to use==========Phasespace can directly be used to generate from a DecayChain using the`DecayLanguage &lt;https://github.com/scikit-hep/decaylanguage&gt;`_ package as`explained in the tutorial &lt;https://phasespace.readthedocs.io/en/latest/GenMultiDecay_Tutorial.html&gt;`_.The generation of simple `n`-body decays can be done using the ``nbody_decay`` shortcut to create a decay chainwith a very simple interface: one needs to pass the mass of the top particle and the masses of the children particle asa list, optionally giving the names of the particles. Then, the ``generate`` method can be used to produce the desired sample.For example, to generate `B^0\to K\pi`, we would do:.. code-block:: python   import phasespace   B0_MASS = 5279.65   PION_MASS = 139.57018   KAON_MASS = 493.677   weights, particles = phasespace.nbody_decay(B0_MASS,                                               [PION_MASS, KAON_MASS]).generate(n_events=1000)Behind the scenes, this function runs the TensorFlow graph. It returns `tf.Tensor`, which, as TensorFlow 2.x is in eager mode,is basically a numpy array. Any `tf.Tensor` can be explicitly converted to a numpy array by calling `tf.Tensor.numpy()` on it.The `generate` function returns a `tf.Tensor` of 1000 elements in the case of ``weights`` and a list of``n particles`` (2) arrays of (1000, 4) shape,where each of the 4-dimensions corresponds to one of the components of the generated Lorentz 4-vector.All particles are generated in the rest frame of the top particle; boosting to a certain momentum (or list of momenta) can beachieved by passing the momenta to the ``boost_to`` argument.Sequential decays can be handled with the ``GenParticle`` class (used internally by ``generate``) and its ``set_children`` method.As an example, to build the `B^{0}\to K^{*}\gamma` decay in which `K^*\to K\pi`, we would write:.. code-block:: python   from phasespace import GenParticle   B0_MASS = 5279.65   KSTARZ_MASS = 895.55   PION_MASS = 139.57018   KAON_MASS = 493.677   kaon = GenParticle('K+', KAON_MASS)   pion = GenParticle('pi-', PION_MASS)   kstar = GenParticle('K*', KSTARZ_MASS).set_children(kaon, pion)   gamma = GenParticle('gamma', 0)   bz = GenParticle('B0', B0_MASS).set_children(kstar, gamma)   weights, particles = bz.generate(n_events=1000)Where we have used the fact that ``set_children`` returns the parent particle.In this case, ``particles`` is a ``dict`` with the particle names as keys:.. code-block:: pycon   &gt;&gt;&gt; particles   {'K*': array([[ 1732.79325872, -1632.88873127,   950.85807735,  2715.78804872],          [-1633.95329448,   239.88921123, -1961.0402768 ,  2715.78804872],          [  407.15613764, -2236.6569286 , -1185.16616251,  2715.78804872],          ...,          [ 1091.64603395, -1301.78721269,  1920.07503991,  2715.78804872],          [ -517.3125083 ,  1901.39296899,  1640.15905194,  2715.78804872],          [  656.56413668,  -804.76922982,  2343.99214816,  2715.78804872]]),    'K+': array([[  750.08077976,  -547.22569019,   224.6920906 ,  1075.30490935],          [-1499.90049089,   289.19714633, -1935.27960292,  2514.43047106],          [   97.64746732, -1236.68112923,  -381.09526192,  1388.47607911],          ...,          [  508.66157459,  -917.93523639,  1474.7064148 ,  1876.11771642],          [ -212.28646168,   540.26381432,   610.86656669,   976.63988936],          [  177.16656666,  -535.98777569,   946.12636904,  1207.28744488]]),    'gamma': array([[-1732.79325872,  1632.88873127,  -950.85807735,  2563.79195128],          [ 1633.95329448,  -239.88921123,  1961.0402768 ,  2563.79195128],          [ -407.15613764,  2236.6569286 ,  1185.16616251,  2563.79195128],          ...,          [-1091.64603395,  1301.78721269, -1920.07503991,  2563.79195128],          [  517.3125083 , -1901.39296899, -1640.15905194,  2563.79195128],          [ -656.56413668,   804.76922982, -2343.99214816,  2563.79195128]]),    'pi-': array([[  982.71247896, -1085.66304109,   726.16598675,  1640.48313937],          [ -134.0528036 ,   -49.3079351 ,   -25.76067389,   201.35757766],          [  309.50867032,  -999.97579937,  -804.0709006 ,  1327.31196961],          ...,          [  582.98445936,  -383.85197629,   445.36862511,   839.6703323 ],          [ -305.02604662,  1361.12915468,  1029.29248526,  1739.14815935],          [  479.39757002,  -268.78145413,  1397.86577911,  1508.50060384]])}The `GenParticle` class is able to cache the graphs so it is possible to generate in a loopwithout overhead:.. code-block:: pycon    for i in range(10):        weights, particles = bz.generate(n_events=1000)        ...        (do something with weights and particles)        ...This way of generating is recommended in the case of large samples, as it allows to benefit fromparallelisation while at the same time keep the memory usage low.If we want to operate with the TensorFlow graph instead, we can use the `generate_tensor` methodof `GenParticle`, which has the same signature as `generate`.More examples can be found in the ``tests`` folder and in the `documentation`_... _documentation: https://phasespace.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.htmlPhysics validation==================Physics validation is performed continuously in the included tests (``tests/test_physics.py``), run through GitHub Actions.This validation is performed at two levels:- In simple `n`-body decays, the results of ``phasespace`` are checked against ``TGenPhaseSpace``.- For sequential decays, the results of ``phasespace`` are checked against `RapidSim`_, a &quot;fast Monte Carlo generator  for simulation of heavy-quark hadron decays&quot;.  In the case of resonances, differences are expected because our tests don't include proper modelling of their  mass shape, as it would require the introduction of  further dependencies. However, the results of the comparison can be expected visually.The results of all physics validation performed by the ``tests_physics.py`` test are written in ``tests/plots``... _RapidSim: https://github.com/gcowan/RapidSim/Contributing============Contributions are always welcome, please have a look at the `Contributing guide`_... _Contributing guide: CONTRIBUTING.rst*********Changelog*********Develop==========Major Features and Improvements-------------------------------Behavioral changes------------------Bug fixes and small changes---------------------------Requirement changes-------------------Thanks------1.8.0 (27 Jan 2023)===================Requirement changes-------------------- upgrade to zfit &gt;= 0.10.0 and zfit-physics &gt;= 0.3.0- pinning uproot and awkward to ~4 and ~1, respectively1.7.0 (1.

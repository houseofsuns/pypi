Disconnected data is pruned away according to this graph when reading the contents of a feed.Feeds can also be filtered to create a view specific to your needs. It's most common to filter a feed down to specific dates (``service_id``) or routes (``route_id``), but any field can be filtered... figure:: dependency-graph.png   :alt: dependency graphPhilosphy---------The design of Partridge is guided by the following principles:**As much as possible**- Favor speed- Allow for extension- Succeed lazily on expensive paths- Fail eagerly on inexpensive paths**As little as possible**- Do anything other than efficiently read GTFS files into DataFrames- Take an opinion on the GTFS specInstallation------------.. code:: console    pip install partridge**GeoPandas support**.. code:: console    pip install partridge[full]Usage-----**Setup**.. code:: python    import partridge as ptg    inpath = 'path/to/caltrain-2017-07-24/'Inspecting the calendar~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~**The date with the most trips**.. code:: python    date, service_ids = ptg.read_busiest_date(inpath)    #  datetime.date(2017, 7, 17), frozenset({'CT-17JUL-Combo-Weekday-01'})**The week with the most trips**.. code:: python    service_ids_by_date = ptg.read_busiest_week(inpath)    #  {datetime.date(2017, 7, 17): frozenset({'CT-17JUL-Combo-Weekday-01'}),    #   datetime.date(2017, 7, 18): frozenset({'CT-17JUL-Combo-Weekday-01'}),    #   datetime.date(2017, 7, 19): frozenset({'CT-17JUL-Combo-Weekday-01'}),    #   datetime.date(2017, 7, 20): frozenset({'CT-17JUL-Combo-Weekday-01'}),    #   datetime.date(2017, 7, 21): frozenset({'CT-17JUL-Combo-Weekday-01'}),    #   datetime.date(2017, 7, 22): frozenset({'CT-17JUL-Caltrain-Saturday-03'}),    #   datetime.date(2017, 7, 23): frozenset({'CT-17JUL-Caltrain-Sunday-01'})}**Dates with active service**.. code:: python    service_ids_by_date = ptg.read_service_ids_by_date(path)    date, service_ids = min(service_ids_by_date.items())    #  datetime.date(2017, 7, 15), frozenset({'CT-17JUL-Caltrain-Saturday-03'})    date, service_ids = max(service_ids_by_date.items())    #  datetime.date(2019, 7, 20), frozenset({'CT-17JUL-Caltrain-Saturday-03'})**Dates with identical service**.. code:: python    dates_by_service_ids = ptg.read_dates_by_service_ids(inpath)    busiest_date, busiest_service = ptg.read_busiest_date(inpath)    dates = dates_by_service_ids[busiest_service]    min(dates), max(dates)    #  datetime.date(2017, 7, 17), datetime.date(2019, 7, 19)Reading a feed~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.. code:: python    _date, service_ids = ptg.read_busiest_date(inpath)    view = {        'trips.txt': {'service_id': service_ids},        'stops.txt': {'stop_name': 'Gilroy Caltrain'},    }    feed = ptg.load_feed(path, view)**Read shapes and stops as GeoDataFrames**.. code:: python    service_ids = ptg.read_busiest_date(inpath)[1]    view = {'trips.txt': {'service_id': service_ids}}    feed = ptg.load_geo_feed(path, view)    feed.shapes.head()    #       shape_id                                           geometry    #  0  cal_gil_sf  LINESTRING (-121.5661454200744 37.003512297983...    #  1  cal_sf_gil  LINESTRING (-122.3944115638733 37.776439059278...    #  2   cal_sf_sj  LINESTRING (-122.3944115638733 37.776439059278...    #  3  cal_sf_tam  LINESTRING (-122.3944115638733 37.776439059278...    #  4   cal_sj_sf  LINESTRING (-121.9031703472137 37.330157067882...    minlon, minlat, maxlon, maxlat = feed.stops.total_bounds    #  -122.412076, 37.003485, -121.566088, 37.77639Extracting a new feed~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.. code:: python    outpath = 'gtfs-slim.zip'    view = {'trips.txt': {'service_id': ptg.read_busiest_date(inpath)[1]}}    ptg.extract_feed(inpath, outpath, view)    feed = ptg.load_feed(outpath)    assert service_ids == set(feed.trips.service_id)Features---------  Surprisingly fast :)-  Load only what you need into memory-  Built-in support for resolving service dates-  Easily extended to support fields and files outside the official spec   (TODO: document this)-  Handle nested folders and bad data in zips-  Predictable type conversionsThank You---------I hope you find this library useful. If you have suggestions forimproving Partridge, please open an `issue onGitHub &lt;https://github.com/remix/partridge/issues&gt;`__.=======History=======1.1.1 (2019-09-13)------------------* Improve file encoding sniffer, which was misidentifying some Finnish/emoji unicode. Thanks to @dyakovlev!1.1.0 (2019-02-21)------------------* Add ``partridge.load_geo_feed`` for reading stops and shapes into GeoPandas GeoDataFrames.1.0.0 (2018-12-18)------------------This release is a combination of major internal refactorings and some minor interface changes. Overall, you should expect your upgrade from pre-1.0 versions to be relatively painless. A big thank you to @genhernandez and @csb19815 for their valuable design feedback. If you still need Python 2 support, please continue using version 0.11.0.Here is a list of interface changes:* The class ``partridge.gtfs.feed`` has been renamed to ``partridge.gtfs.Feed``.* The public interface for instantiating feeds is ``partridge.load_feed``. This function replaces the previously undocumented function ``partridge.get_filtered_feed``.* A new function has been added for identifying the busiest week in a feed: ``partridge.read_busiest_date``* The public function ``partridge.get_representative_feed`` has been removed in favor of using ``partridge.read_busiest_date`` directly.* The public function ``partridge.writers.extract_feed`` is now available via the top level module: ``partridge.extract_feed``.Miscellaneous minor changes:* Character encoding detection is now done by the ``cchardet`` package instead of ``chardet``. ``cchardet`` is faster, but may not always return the same result as ``chardet``.* Zip files are unpacked into a temporary directory instead of reading directly from the zip. These temporary directories are cleaned up when the feed is garbage collected or when the process exits.* The code base is now annotated with type hints and the build runs ``mypy`` to verify the types.* DataFrames are cached in a dictionary instead of the ``functools.lru_cache`` decorator.* The ``partridge.extract_feed`` function now writes files concurrently to improve performance.0.11.0 (2018-08-01)-------------------* Fix major performance issue related to encoding detection. Thank you to @cjer for reporting the issue and advising on a solution.0.10.0 (2018-04-30)-------------------* Improved handling of non-standard compliant file encodings* Only require functools32 for Python &lt; 3* ``ptg.parsers.parse_date`` no longer accepts dates, only strings0.9.0 (2018-03-24)------------------* Improves read time for large feeds by adding LRU caching to ``ptg.parsers.parse_time``.0.8.0 (2018-03-14)------------------* Gracefully handle completely empty files. This change unifies the behavior of reading from a CSV with a header only (no data rows) and a completely empty (zero bytes) file in the zip.0.7.0 (2018-03-09)------------------* Fix handling of nested folders and zip containing nested folders.* Add ``ptg.get_filtered_feed`` for multi-file filtering.0.6.1 (2018-02-24)------------------* Fix bug in ``ptg.read_service_ids_by_date``. Reported by @cjer in #27.0.6.0 (2018-02-21)------------------* Published package no longer includes unnecessary fixtures to reduce the size.* Naively write a feed object to a zip file with ``ptg.write_feed_dangerously``.* Read the earliest, busiest date and its ``service_id``'s from a feed with ``ptg.read_busiest_date``.* Bug fix: Handle ``calendar.txt``/``calendar_dates.txt`` entries w/o applicable trips.0.6.0.dev1 (2018-01-23)-----------------------* Add support for reading files from a folder. Thanks again @danielsclint!0.5.0 (2017-12-22)------------------* Easily build a representative view of a zip with ``ptg.get_representative_feed``. Inspired by `peartree &lt;https://github.com/kuanb/peartree/blob/3bfc3f49ae6986d6020913b63c8ee32582b3dcc3/peartree/paths.py#L26&gt;`_.* Extract out GTFS zips by agency_id/route_id with ``ptg.extract_{agencies,routes}``.* Read arbitrary files from a zip with ``feed.get('myfile.txt')``.* Remove ``service_ids_by_date``, ``dates_by_service_ids``, and ``trip_counts_by_date`` from the feed class. Instead use ``ptg.{read_service_ids_by_date,read_dates_by_service_ids,read_trip_counts_by_date}``.0.4.0 (2017-12-10)------------------* Add support for Python 2.7. Thanks @danielsclint!0.3.0 (2017-10-12)------------------* Fix service date resolution for raw_feed. Previously raw_feed considered all days of the week from calendar.txt to be active regardless of 0/1 value.0.2.0 (2017-09-30)------------------* Add missing edge from fare_rules.txt to routes.txt in default dependency graph.0.1.0 (2017-09-23)------------------* First release on PyPI.</longdescription>

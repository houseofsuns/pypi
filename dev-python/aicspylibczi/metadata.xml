We only support 64bit architectures currently if you desperately need 32 bit support please make an issue or modify the source and build it for your use case.## UsageThe first example show how to work with a standard CZI file (Single or Multi-Scene). The second example shows how to work with a Mosaic CZI file.#### Example 1: Read in a czi and select a portion of the image to display```pythonimport numpy as npfrom aicspylibczi import CziFilefrom pathlib import Pathimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltpth = Path('20190610_S02-02.czi')czi = CziFile(pth)# Get the shape of the data, the coordinate pairs are (start index, size)dimensions = czi.get_dims_shape()  # [{'X': (0, 1900), 'Y': (0, 1300), 'Z': (0, 60), 'C': (0, 4), 'S': (0, 40), 'B': (0, 1)}]czi.dims  # BSCZYXczi.size  # (1, 40, 4, 60, 1300, 1900)# Load the image slice I want from the fileimg, shp = czi.read_image(S=13, Z=16)# shp = [('B', 1), ('S', 1), ('C', 4), ('Z', 1), ('Y', 1300), ('X', 1900)]  # List[(Dimension, size), ...]# img.shape = (1, 1, 4, 1, 1300, 1900)   # numpy.ndarray# define helper functionsdef norm_by(x, min_, max_):    norms = np.percentile(x, [min_, max_])    i2 = np.clip((x - norms[0]) / (norms[1] - norms[0]), 0, 1)    return i2def recolor(im):  # transform from rgb to cyan-magenta-yellow    im_shape = np.array(im.shape)    color_transform = np.array([[1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1]]).T    im_reshape = im.reshape([np.prod(im_shape[0:2]), im_shape[2]]).T    im_recolored = np.matmul(color_transform.T, im_reshape).T    im_shape[2] = 3    im = im_recolored.reshape(im_shape)    return im# normalize, combine into RGB and transform to CMYc1 = (norm_by(img[0, 0, 0, 0, 0:750, 250:1000], 50, 99.8) * 255).astype(np.uint8)c2 = (norm_by(img[0, 0, 1, 0, 0:750, 250:1000], 50, 99.8) * 255).astype(np.uint8)c3 = (norm_by(img[0, 0, 2, 0, 0:750, 250:1000], 0, 100) * 255).astype(np.uint8)rgb = np.stack((c1, c2, c3), axis=2)cmy = np.clip(recolor(rgb), 0, 255)# plot using matplotlib¶plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))plt.imshow(cmy)plt.axis('off')```![Cardio Image](images/cardio.png)#### Example 2: Read in a mosaic file```pythonimport numpy as npimport aicspylibcziimport pathlibfrom PIL import Imagemosaic_file = pathlib.Path('mosaic_test.czi')czi = aicspylibczi.CziFile(mosaic_file)# Get the shape of the datadimensions = czi.dims  # 'STCZMYX'czi.size  # (1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 624, 924)czi.get_dims_shape()  # [{'X': (0, 924), 'Y': (0, 624), 'Z': (0, 1), 'C': (0, 1), 'T': (0, 1), 'M': (0, 2), 'S': (0, 1)}]czi.is_mosaic()  # True# Mosaic files ignore the S dimension and use an internal mIndex to reconstruct, the scale factor allows one to generate a manageable imagemosaic_data = czi.read_mosaic(C=0, scale_factor=1)mosaic_data.shape  # (1, 1, 624, 1756)# the C channel has been specified S &amp; M are used internally for position so this is (T, Z, Y, X)normed_mosaic_data = norm_by(mosaic_data[0, 0, :, :], 5, 98) * 255img = Image.fromarray(normed_mosaic_data.astype(np.uint8))```![Mosaic Image](images/mosaic.png)## InstallationThe preferred installation method is with `pip install`.This will install the aicspylibczi python module and extension binaries ([hosted on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/aicspylibczi/)):`pip install aicspylibczi`**If this doesn't work:** Please investigate the following (generally windows issues):- your OS is 64 bit - we only support 64 bit binaries- your python is a 64 bit application (not 32 bit)- are your C++ runtime libraries up to date? [vc_redist.exe](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)If you have tried this and are still having trouble please reach out to us and we will endeavor to help.## DocumentationDocumentation is available at[github.io](https://allencellmodeling.github.io/aicspylibczi).## BuildUse these steps to build and install aicspylibczi locally:- Clone the repository including submodules (`--recurse-submodules`).- Requirements:  - libCZI requires a c++11 compatible compiler. Built &amp; Tested with clang.  - Development requirements are those required for libCZI: **libpng**, **zlib**  - Install the package:    ```    pip install .    pip install -e .[dev] # for development (-e means editable so changes take effect when made)    pip install .[all] # for everything including jupyter notebook to work with the Example_Usage above    ```  - libCZI is automatically built as a submodule and linked statically into aicspylibczi.- Note: If you get the message directly below on windows you need to set PYTHONHOME to be the folder the python.exe you are compiling against lives in.```EXEC : Fatal Python error : initfsencoding: unable to load the file system codec ...ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'encodings'```## Known Issues- with read_mosaic if the scale_factor is not 1.0 Zeiss's libCZI will, on some files, fail to render certain subblocks  within the composite mosaic image. It is not currently known if this is an issue with the file or with libCZI.## Historyaicspylibczi was originally a fork of [pylibczi](https:://github.com/elhuhdron/pylibczi) that was developed byPaul Watkins and focused on mSEM data. In attempting to extend the work to we transitionedto pybind11, implemented c++ and python tests, added continuous integration via github actions,and added the functionality to read individual subblocks and stacks of subblocks as a numpy.ndarray.Metadata reading, including specific subblock metadata reading has also been added.We intend for this work to be merged back into the original project once we have the new work integrated withthe original work.## Licenses &amp; AcknowledgementsThis project was created from a fork of pylibczi as explained above in the history section and Paul Watkinsis a developer on our repo as well.

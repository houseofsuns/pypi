This mirrors a change in the influxDB to store index timestamps as UTC.  There is a switch to convert the index from TAI to UTC, but the default is to assume UTC everywhere.0.9.1 (2021-10-28)------------------* Fix various bugs left over from the UTC conversions.  The most important of these is correcting how the index for packed time series is handled.  The other is in the implementation fow how we attempt to handle legacy databases with the index still in TAI.0.10.0 (2021-11-18)-------------------* Change how ports are handled.  This forces the port to be sent with the rest of the auth information and removes the ability to pass an override port.0.10.2 (2022-05-03)-------------------* Allow astropy to raise an exception for malformed units in the topic schema.0.11.0 (2022-05-24)-------------------* Updates to API calls to handle SAL 7 change to indexed component ID field.* Add timeout option to the EFD client.  Set the `aiohttp.client` timeout when working with chunked queries. Set a default timeout of 900 seconds.0.12.0 (2022-07-27)-------------------* The auth helper can now use a path attribute to connect to an InfluxDB instance.0.13.0 (2023-06-26)-------------------* `EfdClient` now accepts non-UTC astropy.time.Time values (converting them, if necessary).* Fix unit tests:  * Update ``casettes/*.yaml`` to include &quot;path&quot; as a returned value.  * Change fixture ``efd_client`` to an async context manager ``make_efd_client`` and call it explicitly.  * Import ``vcr`` explicitly and configure it so that it fails if the specified cassette files cannot be found or used.    This avoids two sources of mysterious failures.  * Consolidate a few tests to make it clearer that they are testing the same thing, and to reduce the number of cassette files needed.* Run black and isort on the code.0.13.1 (2023-07-01)-------------------* numpy 1.25.0 breaks compatibility with aioinflux.   Pin numpy to version 1.23.5</longdescription>

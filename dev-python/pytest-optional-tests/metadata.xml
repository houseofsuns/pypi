Neither mechanism makes iteasy to surpress certain tests by default.  For example, one mightdecorate tests with `@pytest.mark.network`, but disabling it bydefault requires a marker expression like `-m &quot;not network&quot;` withevery invocation.  Markers and marker expressions become unwieldy whenthere are many markers.This plugin enables users to declare that certain markers are&quot;optional markers&quot;.  When tests are decorated with an optional marker,the test is skipped by default.  Tests may be decorated with multiplemarkers, including multiple optional markers.  Optional tests may beenabled in the pytest ini file or the command line.Installation------------You can install &quot;pytest-optional-tests&quot; via `pip`_ from `PyPI`_::    $ pip install pytest-optional-testsUsage-----Optional markers must be declared in inicfg using the same syntax asthe markers option.  For example::  [pytest]  optional_tests:    slow: slow tests    network: network tests    bug: regression tests against previous bugsOptional markers should NOT be declared using the `markers` attribute,even when using pytest's `strict` mode. Optional test decorators are pytest markers, and the semantics areidentical.If a test is decorated with multiple optional markers, the test willbe executed when any of the markers is requested. For example::  @pytest.mark.network  @pytest.mark.slow  def test_slow_network_function(): ...will be tested if either or both of the optional `slow` or `network`tests are requested.Optional tests may be requested in the inicfg::  [pytest]  optional_tests:    slow: slow tests    network: network tests    bug: regression tests against previous bugs  run_optional_tests=network,slowor on the command line::  pytest --run-option-tests=network,slowContributing------------Contributions are very welcome. Tests can be run with `tox`_, please ensurethe coverage at least stays the same before you submit a pull request.License-------Distributed under the terms of the `MIT`_ license.Issues------If you encounter any problems, please `file an issue`_ along with a detailed description.This `pytest`_ plugin was generated with `Cookiecutter`_ along with `@hackebrot`_'s `cookiecutter-pytest-plugin`_ template... _`Cookiecutter`: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter.. _`@hackebrot`: https://github.com/hackebrot.. _`MIT`: http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.. _`BSD-3`: http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.. _`GNU GPL v3.0`: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt.. _`Apache Software License 2.0`: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.. _`cookiecutter-pytest-plugin`: https://github.com/pytest-dev/cookiecutter-pytest-plugin.. _`file an issue`: https://github.com/reece/pytest-optional-tests/issues.. _`pytest`: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest.. _`tox`: https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.. _`pip`: https://pypi.org/project/pip/.. _`PyPI`: https://pypi.org/project</longdescription>

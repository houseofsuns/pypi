Cogment enables AI researchers and engineers to build, train and operate AI agents in simulated or real environments shared with humans. For the full user documentation visit &lt;https://docs.cogment.ai&gt;This module, `cogment-py-sdk`, is the Python SDK for making use of Cogment when working with Python. It's full documentation can be consulted at &lt;https://docs.cogment.ai/cogment/cogment-api-reference/python/&gt;.## Developers### PrerequisitesMake sure you have the following installed:- [Python](https://www.python.org) &gt;=3.7, &lt;3.11### Install dependenciesWe recommend using a virtualenv to isolate your dependencies. On most unix flavors you create and activate this by running the following:```console$ python -m venv .venv$ source .venv/bin/activate```once you are finished with the virtualenv you can deactivate it by running:```console$ deactivate```Install the dependencies, including downloading and building the cogment protobuf API by running the following:```console$ pip install -r requirements.txt$ python -m setup develop```The second line will call the following `setup.py` commands to deal with the cogment API (those can also be called seprately)```console$ python -m setup retrieve_cogment_api$ python -m setup build_cogment_api_protos```### Define used Cogment protobuf APIThe version of the used cogment protobuf API is defined in the `.cogment-api.yaml` file at the root of the repository. The following can be defined:- `cogment_version: &quot;latest&quot;`, is the default, it retrieves the api from the _latest_ Cogment release (excluding pre-releases),- `cogment_version: &quot;vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-PRERELEASE]&quot;`, retrieves the api from any Cogment release.- `cogment_api_path: &quot;../RELATIVE/PATH/TO/LOCAL/COGMENT/INSTALL/include/cogment/api&quot;`, retrieves a local version of the api found at the given path (e.g. `common.proto` should be at `${cogment_api_path}/common.proto`); if set, this overrides `cogment_version`.After any change, do not forget to run `pip install -e .` for it to be taken into account.### Tests#### Integration testsThese tests launch and use Cogment, by default they'll use they'll download and use the latest released version of Cogment.```console$ pytest --launch-orchestrator```The following environment can be defined to change this behavior, either directly in the terminal or in a `.env` file located at the root of the repository:```bashCOGMENT_PATH=&quot;/path/to/cogment&quot; # local path to cogment binaryCOGMENT_VERSION=&quot;v2.2.0&quot; # cogment version to download```### LintRun the `pycodestyle` using```console$ pycodestyle```Run the `mypy` type annotations checks using```console$ mypy cogment/```### Check conflicting dependencies with &quot;popular&quot; Python packages```console./scripts/check_dependencies_conflicts.sh```This script will check for conflicts required by the cogment-py-sdk and the popular Python packages in the AI/ML/Data ecosystem.### Build the source packageBuild the source package```consolepython -m build```### Release processPeople having mainteners rights of the repository can follow these steps to release a version **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**. The versioning scheme follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).1. Run `./scripts/create_release_branch.sh MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` to create the release branch and update the version of the package,2. On the release branch, check and update the changelog if needed,3. Make sure `./.cogment-api.yaml` specifies fixed version to ensure rebuildability,4. Make sure everything's fine on CI,5. Run `./scripts/tag_release.sh MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` to create the specific version section in the changelog, merge the release branch in `main`, create the release tag and update the `develop` branch with those.The rest, publishing the package to PyPI and updating the mirror repositories, is handled directly by the CI.# ChangelogAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).## Unreleased## v2.8.3 - 2023-08-22## Fixed- Upgraded to support PyYaml up to 6.0.1 as [v5 was broken](https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/issues/724) by the release of cython 3.## v2.8.2 - 2023-07-10## Fixed- Return None when no data is availble in datastore content## v2.8.1 - 2023-06-06## Fixed- Use the most recent directory entry when there are duplicates- Self IP address discovery functionality is now working on macOS## v2.8.0 - 2023-04-21### Added- Option to request full info (not just id and state) from 'watch_trials'- Ability to use the SDK without spec (cog_settings)- Automatic port selection for 'Context.serve_all_registered()'- Ability to specify an explicit host to register a service to the directory- Ability to specify trial properties for 'Datastore.all_trials()' and 'Datastore.get_trials()'- Ability to specify trial ids for 'Datastore.all_trials()'### Changed- Enable warning and error logging even if user did not define a logging handler- Warn user when no logging handler is defined (i.e. proper logging is disabled)- Better self IP address discovery functionality## v2.7.1 - 2023-03-06## Fixed- Deadlock in 'wait_for_newer' method of LatestModel## v2.7.0 - 2023-02-28### Changed- Facility to track latest models automatically in the Model Registry### Added- 'properties' attribute to TrialParameters and TrialInfo## v2.6.0 - 2023-02-03### Changed- Prometheus service is disabled by default### Added- Model Registry method `iteration_updates` to stream/push new model iterations- Parameter `wait_for_trials` (for Datastore method `all_trials`) to wait for new trials## v2.5.0 - 2023-01-26## Fixed- In Datastore reward could be returned as 'None' instead of 0.0### Added- Simplified interface for Model Registry (context.get_model_registry_v2)## v2.4.1 - 2022-12-02- Support and dependency check for python 3.10## v2.4.0 - 2022-11-18### Added- 'COGMENT_LOG_LEVEL' environment variable- Model Registry client## Fixed- Port parameter needs to be an int- Context datastore request with default endpoint## v2.3.0 - 2022-09-20## Fixed- Reward tick ID was hard coded to -1### Changed- Deprecation warning are only logged once### Added- 'Version' grpc method for pre-trial hooks- Out-of-sync flag in datalog samples- Parameter 'nb_buffered_ticks'- Support for actor disconnection and response timeout parameters- Global Directory integration- Support for self registration to the Directory- Use environment variable for Directory access details## v2.2.2 - 2022-06-20## Fixed- Generate to handle multiple imports properly- Output deprecated warning for use of 'snapshot' in received observation## v2.2.1 - 2022-05-27## Fixed- Fix install of the package from a wheel### Changed- Replace poetry centric build process with modern setuptools## v2.2.0 - 2022-05-07### Added- Introduce `cogment.generate.generate`, a function making the code generation previously available through `python -m cogment.generate` accessible as a function.### Changed- Integration tests are now able to install the Cogment CLI on their own.- Integration tests no longer uses a Docker image.## Fixed- Fix integration test junit report output.## v2.1.1 - 2022-04-11## Fixed- Fixed a typo in the TrialParameter &quot;environemnt_name&quot;

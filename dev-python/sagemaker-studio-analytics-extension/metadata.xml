	<longdescription># SageMaker Studio Analytics ExtensionThis is a notebook extension provided by AWS SageMaker Studio Team to integrate with analytics resources. Currently, it supports connecting SageMaker Studio Notebook to Spark(EMR) cluster through SparkMagic library.## UsageBefore you can use the magic command to connect Studio notebook to EMR, please ensure the SageMaker Studio has the connectivity to Spark cluster(livy service). You can refer to [this AWS blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/amazon-sagemaker-studio-notebooks-backed-by-spark-in-amazon-emr/) for how to set up SageMaker Studio and EMR cluster. ### Register the magic command:```buildoutcfg%load_ext sagemaker_studio_analytics_extension.magics```### Show help content:```buildoutcfgDocstring:::  %sm_analytics [--auth-type AUTH_TYPE] [--cluster-id CLUSTER_ID]                    [--language LANGUAGE]                    [--assumable-role-arn ASSUMABLE_ROLE_ARN]                    [--emr-execution-role-arn EMR_EXECUTION_ROLE_ARN]                    [--secret SECRET]                    [--verify-certificate VERIFY_CERTIFICATE]                    [command [command ...]]positional arguments:  command               Command to execute. The command consists of a service                        name followed by a ' ' followed by an operation.                        Supported services are ['emr'] and supported                        operations are ['connect']. For example a valid                        command is 'emr connect'.optional arguments:  --auth-type AUTH_TYPE                        The authentication type to be used. Supported                        authentication types are {'Basic_Access', 'Kerberos',                        'None'}.  --cluster-id CLUSTER_ID                        The cluster id to connect to.  --language LANGUAGE   Language to use. The supported languages for IPython                        kernel(s) are {'python', 'scala'}. This is a required                        argument for IPython kernels, but not for magic                        kernels such as PySpark or SparkScala.  --assumable-role-arn ASSUMABLE_ROLE_ARN                        The IAM role to assume when connecting to a cluster in                        a different AWS account. This argument is not required                        when connecting to a cluster in the same AWS account.  --emr-execution-role-arn EMR_EXECUTION_ROLE_ARN                        The IAM role passed to EMR to set up EMR job security                        context. This argument is optional and used when IAM                        Passthrough feature is enabled for EMR.  --secret SECRET       The AWS Secrets Manager SecretID.  --verify-certificate VERIFY_CERTIFICATE                        Determine if SSL certificate should be verified when                        using HTTPS to connect to EMR. Supported values are                        ['True', 'False', 'PathToCert']. If a path-to-cert-                        file is provided, the certificate verification will be                        done with the certificate in the provided file                        path.Note that the default ```### Examples1. Connect Studio notebook using IPython Kernel to EMR cluster protected by Kerberos. ```buildoutcfg%sm_analytics emr connect --cluster-id j-1JIIZS02SEVCS --auth-type Kerberos --language python```2. Connect Studio notebook using IPython Kernel to HTTP Basic Auth protected EMR cluster and create the Scala based session.  ```buildoutcfg%sm_analytics emr connect --cluster-id j-1KHIOQZAQUF5P --auth-type Basic_Access  --language scala```3. Connect Studio notebook using IPython Kernel to EMR cluster directly without Livy authentication. ```buildoutcfg%sm_analytics emr connect --cluster-id j-1KHIOQZAQUF5P --auth-type None  --language python```4. Connect Studio notebook using PySpark or Spark(scala) Kernel to HTTP Basic Auth protected EMR cluster. ```buildoutcfg%sm_analytics emr connect --cluster-id j-1KHIOQZAQUF5P --auth-type Basic_Access```## LicenseThis library is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.

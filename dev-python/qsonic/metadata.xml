It also provides an efficient API to read DESI quasar spectra.The key differences-------------------- Coadding of spectrograph arms is optional and performed after continuum fitting.- Continuum is multiplied by a fiducial mean flux when provided.- You can pass fiducial var_lss (column **VAR_LSS**) and mean flux (column **MEANFLUX**) for observed wavelength **LAMBDA** in **STATS** extention of a FITS file. Wavelength should be linearly and equally spaced. This is the same format as rawio output from picca, except **VAR** column in picca is the variance on flux not deltas. We break away from that convention by explicitly requiring variance on deltas in a new column.- If no fiducial is passed, we fit only for var_lss (no eta fitting by default). Eta fitting can be enabled, but is not recommended for Lya forest.- Internal weights for continuum fitting and coadding are based on smoothed ``IVAR``, and output ``WEIGHT`` is based on this smoothed ivar. This smoothing can be turned off.- Chi2 information as well as best fits are saved in continuum_chi2_catalog.fits. Chi2 is calculated using smooth ivar and var_lss, and does not subtract sum of ln(weights).Similarities------------+ Delta files are the same. ``CONT`` column is mean flux times continuum even when fiducial mean flux is passed.+ ``MEANSNR`` in header file and chi2 catalog is average of flux times square root of positive ivar values. Header values are per arm, but catalog values are the average over all arms.+ Eta fitting does not rescale ``IVAR`` output. Pipeline noise will be modified with explicit calibration option.</longdescription>

For each directory that contains files, ``pftree`` will create a dictionary key of the directory path, and will store a list of filenames for the key value.``pftree`` in and of itself does not really do any work. It is a class/module that abstracts the internals for representing file system hierarchies in dictionary form to be used by other modules. As a convenience, however, the ``--stats`` or ``--statsReverse`` do provide a useful analog for sorted directory usage down a file system tree.Several simple file and directory name filters can be applied which can facilitate the targetting of very specific elements in a file system tree.The core the of the class is a ``tree_analysisApply()`` method, that accepts various kwargs. When called, this method will loop over the dictionary, and for each key (i.e. 'path') will execute a callback method. This callback is passed the dictionary value at that key (i.e. usually just the list of files) as well as all the kwargs passed to ``tree_analysisApply()``.Installation------------Dependencies~~~~~~~~~~~~The following dependencies are installed on your host system/python3 virtual env (they will also be automatically installed if pulled from pypi):-  ``pfmisc`` (various misc modules and classes for the pf* family of objects)-  ``tqdm`` (console prettiness for progress bars)Using ``PyPI``~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The best method of installing this script and all of its dependencies isby fetching it from PyPI.. code:: bash        pip3 install pftreeCommand line arguments----------------------.. code:: html        --inputDir &lt;inputDir&gt;        Input directory to examine. The downstream nested structure of this        directory is examined and recreated in the &lt;outputDir&gt;.        [--outputDir &lt;outputDir&gt;]        The directory to contain a tree structure identical to the input        tree structure, and which contains all output files from the        per-input-dir processing.        [--maxdepth &lt;dirDepth&gt;]        The maximum depth to descend relative to the &lt;inputDir&gt;. Note, that        this counts from zero! Default of '-1' implies transverse the entire        directory tree.        [--relativeDir]        A flag argument. If passed (i.e. True), then the dictionary key values        are taken to be relative to the &lt;inputDir&gt;, i.e. the key values        will not contain the &lt;inputDir&gt;; otherwise the key values will        contain the &lt;inputDir&gt;.        [--inputFile &lt;inputFile&gt;]        An optional &lt;inputFile&gt; specified relative to the &lt;inputDir&gt;. If        specified, then do not perform a directory walk, but target this        specific file.        [--fileFilter &lt;someFilter1,someFilter2,...&gt;]        An optional comma-delimated string to filter out files of interest        from the &lt;inputDir&gt; tree. Each token in the expression is applied in        turn over the space of files in a directory location according to a        logical operation, and only files that contain this token string in        their filename are preserved.        [--filteFilterLogic AND|OR]        The logical operator to apply across the fileFilter operation. Default        is OR.        [--dirFilter &lt;someFilter1,someFilter2,...&gt;]        An additional filter that will further limit any files to process to        only those files that exist in leaf directory nodes that have some        substring of each of the comma separated &lt;someFilter&gt; in their        directory name.        [--dirFilterLogic AND|OR]        The logical operator to apply across the dirFilter operation. Default        is OR.        [--outputLeafDir &lt;outputLeafDirFormat&gt;]        If specified, will apply the &lt;outputLeafDirFormat&gt; to the output        directories containing data. This is useful to blanket describe        final output directories with some descriptive text, such as        'anon' or 'preview'.        This is a formatting spec, so            --outputLeafDir 'preview-%%s'        where %%s is the original leaf directory node, will prefix each        final directory containing output with the text 'preview-' which        can be useful in describing some features of the output set.        [--threads &lt;numThreads&gt;]        If specified, break the innermost analysis loop into &lt;numThreads&gt;        threads. Please note the following caveats:            * Only thread if you have a high CPU analysis loop. Note that              the input file read and output file write loops are not              threaded -- only the analysis loop is threaded. Thus, if the              bulk of execution time is in file IO, threading will not              really help.            * Threading will change the nature of the innermost looping              across the problem domain, with the result that *all* of the              problem data will be read into memory! That means potentially              all the target input file data across the entire input directory              tree.        [--json]        If specified, do a JSON dump of the entire return payload.        [--followLinks]        If specified, follow symbolic links.        [--overwrite]        If specified, allow for overwriting of existing files        [--man]        Show full help.        [--synopsis]        Show brief help.        [--verbosity &lt;level&gt;]        Set the app verbosity level. This ranges from 0...&lt;N&gt; where internal        log messages with a level=&lt;M&gt; will only display if M &lt;= N. In this        manner increasing the level here can be used to show more and more        debugging info, assuming that debug messages in the code have been        tagged with a level.        [--stats | --statsReverse | --du | --duf]        If specified, return some stats to caller. The amount of information        returned depends on the --verbosity.        For --stats (and --statsReverse):            * --verbosity 0: return only a final summary of group statistics            * --verbosity 1: in addition, return a sorted (by size) list of                             subdirectories in the search tree            * --verbosity &gt;1: same as above, but provide probing status updates.                              NOTE: this incurs a significant performance penalty!        For --du | --duf            similar to '--stats' but return directory lists in a fashion similar            to the GNU 'du' tool. Both of these set default verbosity values so that            * --du : only provide a summary            * --duf: provide the (full) sorted list as well        [--3D]        A &quot;toy&quot; flag that simply shows the final stats report with an ASCII        3D effect.        [--jsonStats]        If specified, do a JSON dump of the stats.        [--syslog]        If specified, prepend output 'log' messages in syslog style.        [--test &lt;analysisDelayLength[:&lt;type&gt;]&gt;]        If specified, perform a test/dummy run through the            - read            - analyze            - write        callbacks. The &lt;analysisDelayLength&gt; denotes time (in seconds)        to delay in the analysis loop -- useful for testing threading        performance.        An optional [:&lt;type&gt;] can be specified.            :0  - write the 'l_file' to each outputdir, i.e. a simple 'ls'                  analog            :1  - write only the number of files analyzed to each outputdir,                  i.e. a summary.        For large trees, ':0' can take a significantly longer time than        ':1'.Examples--------stats~~~~~Run on a target tree and output some detail and stats.. code:: bash        pftree          --inputDir /var/www/html                                \                        --printElapsedTime                                      \                        --stats --verbosity 0Increasing the ``verbosity`` will produce increasing output on the console. Passinga ``--json`` will return a highly detailed JSON payload with considerable information.Passing a ``--jsonStats`` will only return a summary of the final stats on thefilesystem probed. Note that the ``--verbosity`` flag is ignored if ``--json`` or ``--jsonStats`` are also present... code:: bash    pftree          --duf --inputDir /var/www/htmlSimpler CLI for a less &quot;progress displaying&quot; but faster response.test~~~~Run a test down a target tree:.. code:: bash        pftree          --inputDir /etc                                         \                        --outputDir /tmp/test                                   \                        --verbosity 1 --relativeDir                             \                        --outputLeafDir 'preview-%%s'                           \                        --test 0which will &quot;copy&quot; the input tree to the output, and save a file-ls.txt in each directory where necessary. Note the ``-r`` for 'relative' directory specification and the ``--outputLeafDir`` spec._-30-_</longdescription>

	<longdescription># MongeasyMongeasy is a powerful yet easy-to-use Python library for interacting with MongoDB databases. Embracing the dynamic nature of Python and MongoDB, Mongeasy eliminates the need for rigid schemas and validation layers. This means you can store and handle data in its natural form, just as it is used in your application, enhancing code readability and efficiency.However, Mongeasy's flexibility doesn't mean it compromises on control. With its built-in plugin system, you can hook into the lifecycle of a document and the database connection, enabling advanced features like data validation, logging, and more as per your application's requirements.Whether you're developing a small personal project or a large-scale production application, Mongeasy helps you focus more on your application logic, and less on managing your database. Experience the freedom of schema-less design with the power of customization, all bundled in a single, user-friendly package.## InstallationMongoeasy is available on PyPI and can be installed using pip:```bashpip install mongeasy```## DocumentationThe documentation can be found at [https://mongeasy.readthedocs.io](https://mongeasy.readthedocs.io)## What's new in version 0.2.4?### Support for lazy queriesThe find method now supports a lazy flag (defeault set to False) which when set to True, returns a lazy query object instead of a result list. This is useful when you want to iterate over a large number of documents without loading them all into memory at once.```pythonfrom mongeasy import create_document_classUser = create_document_class('User', 'users')# Find all documents in the 'users' collectionusers = User.all(lazy=True)# Find all documents with age 25users = User.find({'age': 25}, lazy=True)```### Breaking changes (0.2.0)The class method `delete` has been renamed to `delete_many` as the name conflicted with the instance method `delete`.--------------------## ConnectionConnection to the database is handled automatically for you if you have the connection information in a configfile or set as environment variables.### Connection using configfileCreate a file called `mongeasy_config.yml` and place it in your project root folder.The contents of the file should be:```bashdb_config:  uri: mongodb://localhost:27017  database: mydatabase```### Connection using environment variablesYou can, as an alternative method, define your connection information using environment variables. Just set these two:```bashMONGOEASY_CONNECTION_STRING=mongodb://localhost:27017/MONGOEASY_DATABASE_NAME=mydatabase```Absolutely, here's a revised version of your examples section:---## Create a Document ClassIn Mongeasy, you interact with your MongoDB collections through document classes. A document class is a Python class that represents a MongoDB collection and provides methods for interacting with that collection.You can create a document class using the `create_document_class` factory function. The first argument is the name you want to give to the class (which should be the singular form of the collection name), and the second argument is the name of the MongoDB collection that the class will interact with.```pythonfrom mongeasy import create_document_classUser = create_document_class('User', 'users')```After running this code, `User` becomes a new class that you can use to interact with the 'users' collection in your MongoDB database.## Create and Store a DocumentOnce you have a document class, you can use it to create new documents in your MongoDB collection. You can create a document using keyword arguments or by passing a dictionary. After creating a document, you can save it to your MongoDB collection using the `save` method.```pythonfrom mongeasy import create_document_classUser = create_document_class('User', 'users')# Create a document using keyword argumentsuser1 = User(name='Alice', age=25)user1.save()# Create a document using a dictionaryuser2 = User({'name': 'Bob', 'age': 30})user2.save()```In this example, `user1` and `user2` are instances of the `User` document class. When you call the `save` method on these instances, Mongeasy automatically inserts them into the 'users' collection in your MongoDB database.## Find DocumentsYou can retrieve documents from your MongoDB collection using the `find` method on your document class. This method returns a `ResultList` object that contains the found documents.```pythonfrom mongeasy import create_document_classUser = create_document_class('User', 'users')# Find all documents in the 'users' collectionusers = User.all()# Find all documents with age 25users = User.find({'age': 25})```In the first `find` example, Mongeasy returns all documents in the 'users' collection. In the second example, Mongeasy only returns documents where the 'age' field is 25.Find also has a lazy flag (defeault set to False) which when set to True, returns a lazy query object instead of a result list. This is useful when you want to iterate over a large number of documents without loading them all into memory at once.```pythonfrom mongeasy import create_document_classUser = create_document_class('User', 'users')# Find all documents in the 'users' collectionusers = User.all(lazy=True)# Find all documents with age 25users = User.find({'age': 25}, lazy=True)```## Update a DocumentYou can update a document by changing its attributes and then calling the `save` method. Mongeasy automatically updates the corresponding document in your MongoDB collection.```pythonfrom mongeasy import create_document_classUser = create_document_class('User', 'users')# Find one document with age 25user = User.find({'age': 25}).first()if user is not None:    # Update the age of the user    user.age = 26    user.save()```In this example, Mongeasy first retrieves the document where the 'age' field is 25. Then, it changes the 'age' field of the document to 26 and saves the document back to the MongoDB collection.## Delete a DocumentYou can remove a document from your MongoDB collection by calling the `delete` method on an instance of your document class.```pythonfrom mongeasy import create_document_classUser = create_document_class('User', 'users')# Find one document with age 25user = User.find({'age': 25}).first()if user is not None:    user.delete()```In this example, Mongeasy first retrieves the document where the 'age' field is 25. Then, it deletes that document from the 'users' collection in your MongoDB database.You can also delete all documents in a collection by calling the `delete_many` class method on the generated class.```pythonfrom mongeasy import create_document_classUser = create_document_class('User', 'users')# Delete using a filterUser.delete_many({'age': 25})# Delete all documents in the collectionUser.delete_many()```The `delete_many`method is useful when you want to delete multiple documents at once. The first call above deletes all users with age 25, and the second call deletes all users in the collection. ---## IndexesYou can create indexes on the collection by using the `create_index` method on the generated class.```pythonfrom mongeasy import create_document_classUser = create_document_class('User', 'users')# Create a unique index on the name fieldUser.create_index('name', unique=True)```## Other usesWhen you create the document class you have an option to pass additional bases classes. You can use this feature to add functionality to the generated class.This can also be useful if you want to use Mongeasy with for example flask-login.```pythonfrom flask import Flaskfrom flask_login import UserMixin, LoginManagerfrom mongeasy import create_document_classfrom bson import ObjectIdlogin_manager = LoginManager()# Create User class with mongeasy and UserMixin from flask_login as a base classUser = create_document_class('User', 'users', base_classes=(UserMixin,))def get_id(self):    return str(self._id)# Add get_id method to User classUser.get_id = get_iddef create_app():    app = Flask(__name__)   # Define the user loader function for Flask-Login    @login_manager.user_loader    def load_user(user_id):        # Load the user object from the database using the user_id        user_id = ObjectId(user_id)        user = User.find(_id=user_id).first()        return user    return app```## Query objectsMongeasy simplifies the process of creating complex database queries by using the Query object. This object allows you to use Python-like syntax for creating your queries, making it easier and more intuitive than using traditional MongoDB queries.For instance, consider the following MongoDB query:```pythonquery = {'$or': [{'$or': [{'name': {'$eq': 'John'}}, {'age': {'$lt': 40}}]}, {'$and': [{'name': {'$eq': 'Jane'}}, {'age': {'$gt': 20}}]}]}```You can achieve the same result using the Query object:```pythonfrom mongeasy.core import Queryquery = Query('(name == &quot;John&quot; or age &lt; 40) or (name == &quot;Jane&quot; and age &gt; 20)')```This query can then be used in your database queries like this:```pythonfrom mongeasy import create_document_classfrom mongeasy.core import QueryUser = create_document_class('User', 'users')query = Query('(name == &quot;John&quot; or age &lt; 40) or (name == &quot;Jane&quot; and age &gt; 20)')result = User.find(query)```Mongeasy supports the following operators in the Query object:* `==` equality* `!=` inequality* `&lt;` less than* `&gt;` greater than* `&lt;=` less than or equal to* `&gt;=` greater than or equal to* `and` logical AND* `or` logical OR* `not` logical NOT* `in` check if a value is in a list* `not in` check if a value is not in a listYou can also access subdocuments or nested fields in your documents using the dot notation:```pythonquery = Query('age &gt; 25 and friends.age == 32')```In case of invalid queries, an error will be raised with detailed information about the problem:```pythontry:    query = Query(&quot;age &lt;&gt; 25&quot;)  # Invalid operatorexcept ValueError as e:    print(e)```This approach makes it easier to write, read, and manage your database queries in Python, providing a more user-friendly interface for MongoDB.## ResultListAll queries that can return more than one document will return a `ResultList` object, if not the lazy flag has been set. This object can be used to get the first or last document in the list, or None if no document is found.```pythonfrom mongeasy import create_document_classUser = create_document_class('User', 'users')# Find one document with age 25user = User.find({'age': 25}).first()if user is None:    print('No user found')```There are also other methods on the `ResultList` object that can be used. These are:* `first` - Get the first document in the list or None if no document is found* `last` - Get the last document in the list or None if no document is found* `first_or_none` - Get the first document in the list or None if no document is found, same as first* `last_or_none` - Get the last document in the list or None if no document is found, same as last* `map` - Apply a given function to each element in the list and return a new ResultList containing the results* `filter` - Filter the list using a given function and return a new ResultList containing the results* `reduce` - Apply a given function to each element in the list and return a single value* `group_by` - Group the list by a given key and return a dict with the results grouped by the key* `random` - Get a random document from the list or None if no document is foundIf lazy loading is enabled a LazyResultList. LazyResultList is a lazy version of Result list. It will cache the result of the query and only load the documents when they are accessed. This can be useful if you want to load the documents later or if you want to use the list in a for loop.Methods in the LazyResultList are* `first` - Get the first document in the list * `next` - Get the next document in the list Note that LazyResultList uses the PyMongo cursor generator. If you want to access the cursor directly you can use the `raw_query` method on the Document class.```pythonfrom mongeasy import create_document_classUser = create_document_class('User', 'users')# Find one document with age 25users = User.raw_query({'age': 25})```## Mongeasy Plugin SystemThe Mongeasy library provides a robust and flexible platform for interacting with MongoDB databases. To further enhance its utility and versatility, Mongeasy offers a plugin system. This system allows developers to customize and extend the library's functionality according to their specific needs.The motivation behind the plugin system is to provide a mechanism for developers to introduce new behaviors or modify existing ones without having to alter the core library code. By doing so, it promotes a modular approach where additional features or modifications can be encapsulated within individual plugins. This system fosters a more maintainable codebase, as plugins can be added, removed, or updated independently, without impacting the overall stability or functionality of the library.The plugin system can be particularly beneficial in scenarios where customized behaviors or additional features are required. These might include logging operations, implementing custom data validation or transformation rules, handling errors in specific ways, or integrating with other systems or libraries.In the following sections, we'll delve into more detail about the Mongeasy plugin system, including how to create a plugin, how to register it with the library, and the various hooks available for customization.### Mongeasy Plugin HooksIn Mongeasy, plugins are implemented as classes, and they interact with the library through a series of predefined hook points. A hook point is essentially an event during the lifecycle of the library's operation where a plugin can intervene and perform custom actions. The following are the hook points provided by Mongeasy, listed as method signatures in the plugin class:1. `before_connect(self)`: This method is called before the connection to the MongoDB database is established.2. `after_connect(self)`: This method is called after a successful connection to the MongoDB database is established.3. `before_close(self)`: This method is called before closing the connection to the MongoDB database.4. `after_close(self)`: This method is called after the connection to the MongoDB database has been closed.5. `before_delete_document(self, *args, **kwargs)`: This method is called before a document is deleted from the database. The document that will be deleted is passed as an argument.6. `after_delete_document(self, *args, **kwargs)`: This method is called after a document has been deleted from the database. The document that was deleted is passed as an argument.7. `before_init_document(self, *args, **kwargs)`: This method is called before initializing a new document. The data used to initialize the document is passed as arguments.8. `after_init_document(self, data)`: This method is called after a new document has been initialized. The newly initialized document is passed as an argument.9. `before_query_document(self, cls, *args, **kwargs)`: This method is called before a query is made on the database. The class of the document to be queried and the query parameters are passed as arguments.10. `after_query_document(self, cls, *args, **kwargs)`: This method is called after a query is made on the database. The class of the document queried and the result of the query are passed as arguments.11. `before_save_document(self, *args, **kwargs)`: This method is called before a document is saved to the database. The document to be saved and the save parameters are passed as arguments.12. `after_save_document(self, data)`: This method is called after a document has been saved to the database. The data of the saved document is passed as an argument.13. `validate_document(self, *args, **kwargs)`: This method is called to validate a document before it is saved. The document and the validation parameters are passed as arguments.14. `on_document_validation_error(self, *args, **kwargs)`: This method is called when a document fails validation. The document and the error information are passed as arguments.These hook points allow a plugin to observe and intervene in the key operations of the Mongeasy library, providing the flexibility to extend and customize its behavior.### Example PluginYou can develop and use a local plugin by creating a plugin class and register it.I see, thank you for providing the correct information.Here's the corrected example:Create your plugin class:```pythonclass MyLoggingPlugin:    def before_save_document(self, *args, **kwargs):        print(f&quot;before_save_plugin: before_save, data: {args}, {kwargs}&quot;)                def after_save_document(self, data):        print(f&quot;after_save_plugin: after_save, data: {data}&quot;)```Now, let's register this plugin in the `mongeasy_conf.yml`:```yaml# mongeasy_conf.ymldb_config:  uri: mongodb://localhost:27017  database: mydatabaseplugins:  - my_logging_plugin.MyLoggingPlugin```In the `plugins` section, you specify the Python import path to your plugin class. In this example, it is assumed that your `MyLoggingPlugin` class is located in a Python file named `my_logging_plugin.py` in the same directory as your `mongeasy_conf.yml`. If your plugin is located elsewhere, adjust the import path accordingly.Once you have done this, the `MyLoggingPlugin` will be active when you start your application, and it will log information whenever a document is saved.### Developing Distributable PluginsIf you have developed a plugin that you think would be useful for other users of Mongeasy, you can package it and distribute it via PyPI, the Python Package Index. This allows others to easily install your plugin using `pip`.Here are the general steps you need to follow to package your plugin:1. **Create a new Python project for your plugin.** You will need to create a new Python project directory for your plugin. This should include an `__init__.py` file and a separate Python file for each plugin class.2. **Create a `setup.py` file.** This file is used by Python's packaging tools to install your plugin. It should specify your plugin's name, version, and any dependencies it has. Here's an example `setup.py` file:    ```python    from setuptools import setup, find_packages    setup(        name='your_plugin_name',        version='0.1',        packages=find_packages(),        entry_points={            'mongeasy.plugins': [                'your_plugin_name = your_package.your_module:YourPluginClass',            ],        },        install_requires=[            'mongeasy',            # any other dependencies your plugin has        ],    )    ```3. **Package your plugin.** Once you have your `setup.py` file, you can create a distributable package for your plugin using the following command: `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel`. This will create a `.tar.gz` file and a `.whl` file in a `dist/` directory.4. **Upload your plugin to PyPI.** You can upload your plugin to PyPI using the `twine` tool. First, install `twine` using `pip install twine`. Then, upload your plugin using `twine upload dist/*`.Remember that your plugin class should include the necessary hook methods (e.g., `before_save_document(self, *args, **kwargs)`, `after_save_document(self, data)`, etc.), which will be automatically called by Mongeasy at the appropriate times.Once your plugin is on PyPI, users can install it with pip (`pip install your-plugin-name`) and then add it to their `mongeasy_conf.yml` configuration file like so:```yamlplugins:  - your_plugin_name.YourPluginClass```As always, when developing a plugin, remember to respect the privacy and security of the user's data.## Planned features* ~~Enable lazy-loading of query results and support for query chaining~~* ~~Implement a schema plugin system to allow for validation and type checking of documents~~* Add support for transactions using resource management* Implement logging and profiling to aid with debugging and performance tuning* Enable asynchronous I/O support for improved scalability* Implement caching with customizable caching strategies* Add support for background tasks using a task queue* Implement a paginator utility to allow for pagination of query results* Support for MongoDB Atlas search* Data migration and seeding utilities* Real-time sync feature for monitoring and syncing with another database* Automatic data splitting for large documents approaching the 16 MB limit* Support for SQL-style auto-increment fields* Middleware support for request/response processing* Integration with machine learning libraries for data analysis and prediction* Built-in analytics to provide insights into database usage and performance* Visualization tools to aid with data exploration and presentation## ContributingContributions are welcome.

	<longdescription># Divio Docs GeneratorAutomatically collect, aggregate and structure all your [divio-style documentation](https://documentation.divio.com/) into a tree of .md files.```/{reponame}    /tutorials    /how_to_guides    /explanation    /reference```On a basic level, this repo will only need a list of git url's!- Any input structure: this script will scan your entire repository for .md files    - If you have a how-to section in your README, that'll get extracted and put in the right spot    - Or, if you have an how-to.md file, it'll get added in its entirety!- Any output structure: this script generates a simple markdown tree. Nothing proprietary, no vendor-lockin. It can be generated from GitHub Actions and put into a Jekyll pages site just as easily as it is run from a Raspberry Pi and used to render the contents of an Ember application.All you have to do is simply name your headers and/or files after the divio sections (`tutorials`, `how_to_guides`, `explanation`, `reference`). (Oh, don't worry, the search is done through a case insensitive regex. Add more words as you please) ## Getting-Started / tutorial- Install the package (`python3 -m pip install divio_docs_gen`)- And then either...    - Setup the docs.conf file (See the [reference below](#docsconf) and/or the [docs.conf.example](docs.conf.example) file)    - Use throught the cli (`python3 -m divio_docs_gen --help`)## How-To### Install from pip```bashpython3 -m pip install divio_docs_gen```### Clone &amp; run scripts locally```bashgit clone https://github.com/Denperidge-Redpencil/divio-docs-gen.gitcd divio-docs-genpython3 -m pip install -r requirements.txtpython3 -m src.divio_docs_gen```### Build &amp; install package locally```bashgit clone https://github.com/Denperidge-Redpencil/divio-docs-gen.gitcd divio-docs-gen/python3 -m pip install --upgrade build setuptoolspython3 -m build &amp;&amp; python3 -m pip install --force-reinstall ./dist/*.whl```*Note: other Python versions can be used!*## DiscussionsThe Divio structure is built upon splitting your documentation into 4 types of documentations. ![The overview of the divio documentation on their website](https://documentation.divio.com/_images/overview.png). In this repository they're referred to as sections.If you want to know more about the design principles of this project, feel free to check out my writeup [here](https://github.com/Denperidge-Redpencil/Learning.md/blob/main/Notes/docs.md#design-principles)!Further expansion could be done to this project. For example, a structure like the following...```/{reponame}    /0.0.1        /tutorials        /how_to_guides        /explanation        /reference```... should not be impossible to achieve with some tweaking!## Reference### docs.conf#### [DEFAULT] sectionThis section is on the top of the file, and defines options that affect the entire configuration| Parameter     | Functionality                    || ------------- | -------------------------------- || DefaultOwner  | (string) Defines which user or org has to be checked for the repository in case its Path does not explicitly define an owner || GenerateNav   | (boolean) Whether to add internal navigation to the top of each generated file. Defaults to `False` || DocsBasedir   | What folder to output the docs in. Defaults to `docs/` || Tutorials     | Sets the output folder name for tutorials. Defaults to `tutorials`    || how_to_guides | Sets the output folder name for how-to guides. Defaults to `how_to_guides`    || explanation   | Sets the output folder name for explanation. Defaults to `explanation`    || reference     | Sets the output folder name for reference. Defaults to `reference`    |#### [repo] sectionYou can add as many of these as you want. Each one represents a repo you want parsed. You can give any name to `[the-section-header]`, but you should probably avoid duplicates. If no repo sections are defined but you've defined DefaultOwner, all repos of that user or organisation will be parsed.| Parameter | Functionality                              || --------- | ------------------------------------------ || Path      | (string) Defines which repository to parse || Move      | (string) Files in the repository that should be copied to a specific section. Syntax: `docs/file.md/section_id//file2.md/section_id/output_filename` || Ignore      | (string) Files in the repository that should be ignored. Syntax: `file.md//file2.md` |**Example Ignore:** `Ignore=building-a-template.md//why-semantic-microservices.md`**Example Move:** `Move=documentation.md/reference`*Note: for `Move` and `Ignore` you can choose to be more specific by writing `sub/folder/filename.md`. The check is a `provided_path in full_filepath`, so `sub/folder/filename.md` will apply to `even/further/sub/folder/filename.md`.*### SynonymsFor ease of use and freedom of implementation, every section has synonyms.| Section       | Synonyms                        || ------------- | ------------------------------- || Tutorials     | Getting started                 || How-to Guides | How-To, Guide, Usage            || Explanation   | Discussion, background material | | Reference     | Technical                       |</longdescription>

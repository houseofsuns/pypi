All withjust one single handy command.Assumption: you're using buildout.  Or rather, the assumption is that you havea ``bin/test`` command that runs all your tests.No options are passed to coverage.py, so any extra options you want to give tocoverage must be put in a ``.coveragerc`` in your buildout's root.  This is agood idea in any case :-)  An example .coveragerc that omits code you normallydon't want to include in a coverage report::    [report]    omit =        /home/*/.buildout/eggs/*        /usr/*        parts/*        eggs/*        */test*Installing ``createcoverage`` in a zc.recipe.egg section is enough.Createcoverage itself depends on `coverage.py&lt;http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/&gt;`_ and makes sure ``bin/coverage`` iscreated::    [console_scripts]    recipe = zc.recipe.egg    eggs = createcoverageCode, bugs, ideas-----------------The code is hosted at github: https://github.com/reinout/createcoverage.You can also report `issues and bugs and ideas&lt;https://github.com/reinout/createcoverage/issues&gt;`_ there. Pullrequests are of course also very welcome :-)Development installation------------------------The first time, you'll have to run the &quot;bootstrap&quot; script to set up setuptoolsand buildout::    $ python bootstrap.pyAnd then run buildout to set everything up::    $ bin/buildout(On windows it is called ``bin\buildout.exe``).You'll have to re-run buildout when you or someone else made a change in``setup.py`` or ``buildout.cfg``.The current package is installed as a &quot;development package&quot;, sochanges in .py files are automatically available (just like with ``pythonsetup.py develop``).Tests can always be run with ``bin/test`` or ``bin\test.exe``.Credits=======Created by `Reinout van Rees &lt;http://reinout.vanrees.org&gt;`_.Changelog of createcoverage===========================1.5 (2016-02-02)----------------- Fixed ``bin/coverage`` script (it pointed at an old entry point). Note that  this script is only included because buildout originally didn't install  scripts of dependencies. It *does* now, with the proper configuration. But  installing this script ourselves solves every case.1.4.1 (2015-11-11)------------------- Upped the coverage requirement (to 3.7). Coveralls.io's library needs 3.6  and this makes it a bit easier to make sure there's a new enough release.1.4 (2015-09-17)----------------- Note: no functional changes in this release.- Moved to github: https://github.com/reinout/createcoverage .- Noted (in the ``setup.py`` classifiers) that we work just fine with  python 3!- Set up travis testing and coveralls.io integration. 100% coverage, of course  :-)1.3.2 (2014-12-09)------------------- Packaging fix. Nothing changed (functionally) compared to 1.3.1.3.1 (2014-12-09)------------------- Some internal cleanup and a small pypi metadata fix.1.3 (2014-12-09)----------------- Added ``-t/--test-args`` command line option. The string passed to  that is passed straight on to the test runner. For instance, use  ``-t &quot;-m somemodule&quot;`` to effectively run ``bin/test -m  somemodule``. Note the need for quotes (single or double) as you're  using an option to pass options... Fix by Godefroid Chapelle,  thanks!1.2 (2012-06-28)----------------- Fixed a problem with opening the coverage ``index.html`` file on OS X when  using Python 2.7 or newer by using a file URL instead of a path.1.1 (2011-04-19)----------------- Making the path to the coverage index.html file absolute before opening it  in the webbrowser. This prevents OSX from complaining that it isn't a URL.1.0 (2010-12-20)----------------- Added option (&quot;-d&quot;) for specifying an output directory.  Specifying it also  makes sure the results aren't opened in a webbrowser (as the option is  intended for offline operation for automatic documentation generation  purposes).0.4 (2010-10-05)----------------- Falling back to global 'coverage' binary if there isn't one in  ``bin/coverage``.0.3 (2010-09-20)----------------- Added missing MANIFEST.in file so that the distribution on pypi is complete  now.0.2 (2010-09-20)----------------- Documentation update: pointing at bitbucket for code, issues, ideas.0.1 (2010-09-20)----------------- First working version.- Copied some code from the &quot;createzopecoverage&quot; package.- Initial library skeleton created by nensskel.

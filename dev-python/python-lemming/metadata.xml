With Lemming, everyone will use the same formatters and linters, with the same version.## InstallationUse the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Lemming. _[Need more help?](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/)_```bashpip install python-lemming```## RequirementsLemming requires Python 3.8## Usage### 1. Create the configLemming's config lives in these places:- in the `.lemming.toml` file- in the `pyproject.toml` filePlease note, that there must be a `lemming` or `tool.lemming` key in the config file.The config looks like this:```tomlfail_fast = false  # OPTIONAL, whether or not immediately quit in case of an error[[formatters]]packages = [&quot;example&quot;]  # REQUIRED, the package(s) to install with pip (might include versions with &quot;==x.y.z&quot;)format_command = &quot;{pyexe} -m example {path}&quot;  # REQUIRED, the command to run to format the code ({pyexe} will be replaced with the python executable, {path} with the path passed to Lemming (usually the current working directory: &quot;.&quot;))check_command = &quot;{pyexe} -m example --check {path}&quot;  # OPTIONAL, the command to run to check the code (stuff will be replaced just like in format_command)allow_nonzero_on_format = true  # OPTIONAL, if true it is allowed for the format_command to return a non-zero exit status[[linters]]packages = [&quot;example&quot;]  # REQUIRED, same as for formatterscommand = &quot;{pyexe} -m example {path}&quot;  # REQUIRED, the command to run to lint the code (stuff will be replaced just like in format_command)run_first = true  # OPTIONAL, if true this linter will be ran BEFORE formatters, and linters with this being false. Defaults to false.```### 2. Run LemmingAfter [installing](#installation) Lemming, run```bashlemming {format,check} .```If you choose format, the `format_command`s will be ran, but if you choose check, the `check_command`s will be ran. Linters will be ran in both cases.You can also use Lemming as a GitHub workflow, like [this](.github/workflows/lemming.yml).## CLI usage```textusage: lemming [-h] [-v] [-q] [--quiet-commands] [--quiet-pip] [-c CONFIG] [-V] {format,check} pathLemming is a tool for formatting and linting code.positional arguments:  {format,check}        format the code with the formatters, or check the code with the formatters (linters will be ran in all cases)  path                  the paths (files and directories) to check. These arguments will be passed to the formatters and linters as arguments where {path} is usedoptions:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  -v, --verbose         log more information  -q, --quiet           log less information. Can be passed multiple times  --quiet-commands      don't let ran commands write to stdout and stderr. Use --quiet-pip to quiet `pip`  --quiet-pip           don't let pip write to stdout and stderr. Use --quiet-commands to quiet the formatters and linters  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG                        the config file to use. If passed all other config files will be ignored  -V, --version         print the program's version and exit```## SupportQuestions should be asked in the [Discussions tab](https://github.com/koviubi56/lemming/discussions/categories/q-a).Feature requests and bug reports should be reported in the [Issues tab](https://github.com/koviubi56/lemming/issues/new/choose).Security vulnerabilities should be reported as described in our [Security policy](https://github.com/koviubi56/lemming/security/policy) (in the [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) file).## Contributing[Pull requests](https://github.com/koviubi56/lemming/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests) are welcome.

This can be installed via [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project):    $ pip install napari&gt;0.2.12You can install `napari-mat-images` via [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project):    $ pip install napari-mat-images## UsageOnce installed, the plugin will be used whenever trying to load a `.mat` file.This can be done from the `napari` GUI or commandline:    $ napari my_file.mat## ContributingContributions are very welcome.Tests can be run with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/),please ensure the coverage at least stays the same before you submit a pull request.## LicenseDistributed under the terms of the [BSD-3](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) license, `napari-mat-images` is free and open source software## IssuesIf you encounter any problems, please [file an issue](https://github.com/hectormz/napari-mat-images/issues) along with a detailed description.---This [napari](https://github.com/napari/napari) plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) along with [napari](https://github.com/napari/napari)\'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin](https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin) template.</longdescription>

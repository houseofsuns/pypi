now uses the`Shapely &lt;https://github.com/shapely/shapely&gt;`_ package to power advanced geometry creation andmanipulation, and vastly improves the performance and robustness of the plastic section propertyalgorithm. ``v2.x.x`` introduces many breaking changes from ``v1.x.x`` when creating and manipulating``Geometry``, refer to the `documentation &lt;https://sectionproperties.readthedocs.io&gt;`_ for moreinformation.Pre-Processor:^^^^^^^^^^^^^^A special mention to `@connorferster &lt;https://github.com/connorferster&gt;`_ for a majority of

operators- Added .dxf import, thanks to `@aegis1980 &lt;https://github.com/aegis1980&gt;`_- Added .3dm import, thanks to `@normanrichardson &lt;https://github.com/normanrichardson&gt;`_- Introduction of a ``CompoundGeometry`` class for geometries with multiple regions- ``Geometry`` objects are assigned a ``Material`` property object, ``CompoundGeometry`` objects  can contain multiple ``Geometry`` objects (each with their own ``Material`` object)  enabling composite analysis- ``Geometry`` and ``CompoundGeometry`` objects contain mesh information and meshing must be  performed before initialising a ``Section`` object- Improved ``.offset_perimeter()`` logic- Meshing is now performed by `triangle &lt;https://github.com/drufat/triangle&gt;`_, *meshpy* is no  longer a dependency- ``Material`` class now requires a ``.density`` parameter- The section library (``sectionproperties.pre.library``) now contains the built-in  *sectionproperties* geometries- Added ``triangular_section()`` and ``triangular_radius_section()`` to the ``primitive_sections``  library- Added ``concrete_sections`` library - contains ``concrete_rectangular_section()``,  ``concrete_tee_section()`` and ``concrete_circular_section()``- Added ``bridge_section`` library, thanks to `@ccaprani &lt;https://github.com/ccaprani&gt;`_ - contains  ``super_t_girder_section()`` and ``i_girder_section()``Analysis:^^^^^^^^^- ``cross_section.py`` renamed to ``section.py``- ``CrossSection`` object renamed to ``Section`` and is now initialised with only a ``Geometry`` or  ``CompoundGeometry`` object- Added calculation of cross-section mass- Added calculation of weighted material properties - E_eff, G_eff, nu_eff- The plastic algorithm is now performed by shapely, improving performance and robustness- Added calculation of principal stresses, thanks to `@ccaprani &lt;https://github.com/ccaprani&gt;`_- Shape factors are no longer calculated for composite sections (irrelevant property)Post-Processor:^^^^^^^^^^^^^^- Added the ``plotting_context()`` manager, allowing easily saving files, passing kwargs to ``pyplot.subplots()``  and much more! Many thanks to `@Spectre5 &lt;https://github.com/Spectre5&gt;`_- Improved contour plotting behaviour- Added plotting of Mohr's circle of stresses for any given point, thanks to  `@ccaprani &lt;https://github.com/ccaprani&gt;`_- ``.display_results()`` now reports E.J and E.Iw instead of G.J and G.Iw- ``.display_results()`` now reports modulus weighted shear areas for composite sectionsMisc.:^^^^^^- Many spelling and code style fixes, thanks to `@Spectre5 &lt;https://github.com/Spectre5&gt;`_- Updated documentation to include theoretical background- Updated examples to be performed by sphinx-gallery, thanks to  `@normanrichardson &lt;https://github.com/normanrichardson&gt;`_ and  `@Spectre5 &lt;https://github.com/Spectre5&gt;`_v1.0.8:-------- All plots now return figure and axes objects- Fix bug in frame_properties causing the program to crash under certain circumstancesv1.0.7:-------- Fix bug with geometry cleaning algorithm resulting in an infinite loop- Added NASTRAN sections (JohnDN90)- Added tight_layout to plots (Nils Wagner)- Added BoxGirderSection class- Added cross-section perimeter calculation- Added perimeter offset method (BETA)- Added mesh refinement example to docsv1.0.6:-------- Fix bug with geometry cleaning algorithm resulting in an infinite loop- Added NASTRAN sections (JohnDN90)- Added tight_layout to plots (Nils Wagner)- Added BoxGirderSection class- Added cross-section perimeter calculation- Added perimeter offset method (BETA)- Added mesh refinement example to docsv1.0.5:-------- Added calculation of monosymmetric constants- Added tapered flange I Section and channel sections- Added solid elliptical and hollow elliptical sections (BenjaminFraser)- Added polygonal section (Agent6-6-6)- Handle zero radius for all section classes; handle r_out &lt; t for relevant sections- Update Cee and Zed sections to account for short lipsv1.0.4:-------- Added a monosymmetric I Section class- Extend the plastic centroid search range to the entire section- Remove the pc_region variable from the plastic centroid calculation as it is no longer relevant- Better verbose output for the plastic centroid calculationv1.0.3:-------- Retrieve cross-section stresses using get_stress()v1.0.2:-------- Fix returns for adding to geometryv1.0.1:-------- Added calculate_frame_properties()- Added methods for adding points, facets and control points to geometries- New pypi README filev1.0.0:-------- Initial release.</longdescription>

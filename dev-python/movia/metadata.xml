Based on ffmpeg, this software supports an incredible number of formats and codecs.2. Thanks to operations on the assembly graph, it is able to perform nbr_opti optimization operations.3. nbr_tests unit tests ensure an excelent kernel reliability.4. Unlike other software that offers a timeline, this one allows you to edit an editing graph. This representation is more general and thus allows a greater flexibility.5. A compiled version without graphical interface allows to allocate all the resources of the computer to the export.6. This software generates at the time of the export a python code which can be edited. This offers an infinite number of possibilities!Installation------------Movia has hard dependency on the pygraphviz library and on the ffmpeg package (version &gt;= 4). You should install it first, please refer to the `pygraphviz installation guide &lt;https://pygraphviz.github.io/documentation/stable/install.html&gt;`_ and according to your Linux distribution, to the `FFmpeg download page &lt;https://ffmpeg.org/download.html&gt;`_.In many cases, these commands should work:.. code:: bash    $ sudo apt install ffmpeg    $ sudo apt install graphviz graphviz-devAlthough it is installed automatically, it is better to install **av** manually to avoid redundancy. Please refer to the `PyAv installation guide &lt;https://pyav.org/docs/develop/overview/installation.html&gt;`_.In many cases, these commands should work:.. code:: bash    $ sudo apt install libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libavdevice-dev libavutil-dev libswscale-dev libswresample-dev libavfilter-dev    $ pip install av --no-binary avTo install Movia using `PyPI &lt;https://pypi.org/project/movia/&gt;`_, run the following command:.. code:: bash    $ pip install movia[gui]To install Movia from `Framagit &lt;https://framagit.org/robinechuca/movia&gt;`_ source, clone Movia using ``git`` and install it using ``pip``.:.. code:: bash    git clone https://framagit.org/robinechuca/movia.git    cd movia/    pip install -e ./[optional]In a terminal, simply write the command ``movia-qt`` to launch the GUI and the command ``movia-test`` for launch the test banchmark.What's new ?------------For the complete list of changes, refer to the `git commits &lt;https://framagit.org/robinechuca/movia/-/network/main?ref_type=heads&gt;`_.</longdescription>

	<longdescription># Pynumeral![](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.6-brightgreen.svg) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.7-brightgreen.svg) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/optimdata/pynumeral.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/optimdata/pynumeral)`pynumeral` is a python implementation of number formatting using [numeraljs format](http://numeraljs.com/#format). This project was motivated when we had to render numbers backend-side (which is written in python) while keep using formats defined by users. It has been coded regardless of the javascript implementation. It has been tested on a fairly large amount of formats but there are not any guarantees that it covers all the cases. Since unit testing is pretty simple, contributions are more than welcome.It only provides a simple api `pynumeral.format(value, format)`. * License: [MIT license](https://github.com/optimdata/pynumeral/blob/master/LICENSE)* Source: https://github.com/optimdata/pynumeral* Issues: https://github.com/optimdata/pynumeral/issues## History### 0.1.0 (2019-11-15)* First release on PyPI.</longdescription>

	<longdescription># `cogex``cogex` is a tool for managing extractors for Cognite Data Fusion written in Python. It providesutilities for initializing a new extractor project and building self-contained executables of Pythonbased extractors.## Important note for users running `pyenv``pyenv` is a neat tool for managing Python installations.Since `cogex` uses PyInstaller to build executables, we need Python to be installed with a sharedinstance of `libpython`, which `pyenv` does not do by default. To fix this, make sure to add the`--enable-shared` flag when installing new Python versions with `pyenv`, like so:```bashenv PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS=&quot;--enable-shared&quot; pyenv install 3.9.0```You can read more about it in the [PyInstaller documentation](https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/development/venv.html#pyenv-and-pyinstaller)## Overview of features### Start a new extractor projectTo start a new extractor project, move to the desired directory and run```bashcogex init```You will first be prompted for some information, before `cogex` will initialize a new project.### Add dependenciesExtractor projects initiated with `cogex` will use `poetry` for managing dependencies. Running`cogex init` will automatically install the Cognite SDK and extractor-utils framework, but if yourextractor needs any other dependency, simply add them using `poetry`, like so:```bashpoetry add requests```### Type checking and code styleIt is recommended that you run code checkers on your extractor, in particular: * `black` is an opinionated code style checker that will enforce a consistent code style throughout   your project. This is useful to avoid unecessary changes and minimizing PR diffs. * `isort` is a tool that sorts your imports, also contributing to a consistent code style and   minimal PR diffs. * `mypy` is a static type checker for Python which ensures that you are not making any type errors   in your code that would go unnoticed before suddently breaking your extractor in production.`cogex` will install all of these, and automatically run them on every commit. If you for somereason need to perform a commit despite one of these failing, you can run `git commit --no-verify`,although this is not recommended.### Build and package an extractor projectIt is not always an option to rely on a Python installation at the machine your extractor will bedeployed at. For those scenarios it is useful to package the extractor, including its dependenciesand the Python runtime, into a single self-contained executable. To do this, run```bashcogex build```This will create a new executable (for the operating system you ran `cogex build` from) in the`dist` directory.### Creating a new version of your extractorTo keep track of which version of the code base is running at a given deployment it is very usefulto version your extractor. When releasing a new version, run```bashpoetry version [patch/minor/major]```To automatically bump the corresponding version number. Note that this only updates the versionnumber in `pyproject.toml`. When running `cogex build` this new version number will be propagatedthrough the rest of the code base.Any extractor project should follow semantic versioning, which means you should bump * `patch` for any minor bug fixes or improvements * `minor` for new features or bigger improvements that __doesn't__ break compatability * `major` for new feature or improvements that breaks compatability with previous versions, in   other words for those scenarios where the new version is not a drop-in replacement for an old   version. For example:   - When adding a new required config field   - When removing a config field   - When changing defaults in a way that could break existing deployments</longdescription>

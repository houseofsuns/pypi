Outputs from the simulator can be used to obtain quantitative measures of the effectiveness of these actions.Please refer to our [homepage](https://ictr.github.io/covid19-outbreak-simulator/) for details and cite&gt; Bo Peng, Rowland W Pettit, Christopher I Amos, Population simulations of COVID-19  outbreaks provide tools for risk assessment and continuity planning, JAMIA Open, 2021;, ooaa074, https://doi.org/10.1093/jamiaopen/ooaa074if you have used the simulator for your work. You can also have a look at&gt; Peng B, Zhou W, Pettit RW, et al, Reducing COVID-19 quarantine with SARS-CoV-2 testing: a simulation study BMJ Open 2021;11:e050473. https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-050473for an example for the application of the simulator.</longdescription>

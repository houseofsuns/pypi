Together with the immutabilityproperty, this guarantees that you will always get the same data when querying with thesame accession.#### Corrections, Improvements, ExtensionsEven though data is stored in an immutable way, the metldata still allows forcorrections, improvements, and extensions of submitted data. This is achieved my notjust storing the current state of a submission but by persisting a version history.Thereby, modifications are realized by issuing a new version of the submission withoutaffecting the content of existing versions.#### TransparencyThe version history not only resolved the conflict between immutability and the need toevolve and adapt data, it also make the changes transparent to user relying on the data.#### Multiple RepresentationsOften, the requirements regarding the structure and content of data differs dependingthe use case and the audience. Metldata accounts for this by proving a configurableworkflow engine for transforming submitted metadata into multiple representation of thatdata.#### GDPR ComplianceThe GDPR gives data subjects the right to issue a request to delete data. Metldatacomplies with this demand. Thereby, only entire versions of a submission can be deleted.The associated accessions stay available so that user are informed that the associateddata is not available anymore. The guarantees for immutability and stability ofaccessions are not violated, however, data might become unavailable.## InstallationWe recommend using the provided Docker container.A pre-build version is available at [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ghga/metldata):```bashdocker pull ghga/metldata:0.3.6```Or you can build the container yourself from the [`./Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile):```bash# Execute in the repo's root dir:docker build -t ghga/metldata:0.3.6 .```For production-ready deployment, we recommend using Kubernetes, however,for simple use cases, you could execute the service using dockeron a single server:```bash# The entrypoint is preconfigured:docker run -p 8080:8080 ghga/metldata:0.3.6 --help```If you prefer not to use containers, you may install the service from source:```bash# Execute in the repo's root dir:pip install .# To run the service:metldata --help```## Configuration### ParametersThe service requires the following configuration parameters:- **`artifact_infos`** *(array)*: Information for artifacts to be queryable via the Artifacts REST API.  - **Items**: Refer to *#/definitions/ArtifactInfo*.- **`db_connection_str`** *(string)*: MongoDB connection string.

Currently it isdesigned to mostly run as a CLI application for managing metadata on the local filesystem. However, later, it will be translated into a microservice based-architecture.### One Write and Multiple Read RepresentationsInstead of having just a single copy of metadata in a database thatsupports all CRUD actions needed by all the different user groups, wepropose to follow the CQRS pattern by having one representation that isoptimized for write operations and multiple use case-specificrepresentations for querying metadata. Thereby, the write-specificrepresentation is the source of truth and fuels all read-specificrepresentations through an ETL process. In the following, theread-specific representations are also referred to as artifacts.This setup with one write and multiple read representation has thefollowing advantages:- Different subsets of the entire metadata catalog can be prepared  with the needs and the permissions of different user audiences in  mind.- It allows for independent scalability of read and write operations.- The metadata can be packaged in multiple different formats required  and optimized for different technologies and use cases, such as  indexed searching with ElasticSearch vs. REST or GraphQL queries  supported by MongoDB.- Complex write-optimized representations, which are inconvenient for  querying such as event histories, can be used as the source of  truth.- Often used metadata aggregations and summary statistics can be  precomputed.- Read-specific representations may contain rich annotations that are  not immediately available in the write-specific representation. For  instance, the write-specific representation may only contain one-way  relationships between metadata elements (e.g. a sample might define  a `has_experiment` attribute, while an experiment defines no  `has_sample` attribute), however, a read-specific representation may  contain two way relationships (e.g. a sample defines a  `has_experiment` attribute and an experiment defines a `has_sample`  attribute).However, there are also disadvantages that are linked to this setup thatshould be considered:- The write and read representations are only eventually consistent.- Adds more complexity than a CRUD setup.### Submission-centric Store as The Source of TruthIn the write-specific representation, metadata is packaged intosubmissions. Each submission is fully self-contained and linking betweenmetadata of different submissions is not possible. A submission can haveone of the following statuses:- pending - the construction of the submission is in progress, the  submitter may still change its content.- in-review - the submitter declared the submission as complete and is  waiting for it to be reviewed, however, both the submitter and the  reviewer can set this submission back to pending to enable further  changes.- canceled - the submission was canceled before its completion, its  content was deleted.- completed - the submission has been reviewed and approved, the  content of the submission is frozen, and accessions are generated  for all relevant metadata elements.- deprecated-prepublication - the submission was deprecated and it  cannot be published anymore, however, its content is not deleted  from the system.- emptied-prepublication - the submission was deprecated and its  content was deleted from the system, however, the accessions are not  deleted.- published - the submission was made available to other users.- deprecated-postpublication - the submission was deprecated and it  should not be used anymore, however, its content stays available to  other users.- hidden-postpublication - the submission was deprecated and its  content is hidden from other users but it is not deleted from the  system, the accessions stay available, the submission can be set to  deprecated to make its content available again.- emptied-postpublication - the submission was deprecated and its  content was deleted from the system, however, the accessions stay  available.The following status transitions are allowed:- pending -\&gt; in-review- pending -\&gt; canceled- in-review -\&gt; completed- in-review -\&gt; canceled- in-review -\&gt; pending- completed -\&gt; published- completed -\&gt; deprecated-prepublication- completed -\&gt; emptied-prepublication- deprecated-prepublication -\&gt; emptied-prepublication- published -\&gt; deprecated-postpublication- published -\&gt; hidden-postpublication- published -\&gt; emptied-postpublication- deprecated-postpublication -\&gt; hidden-postpublication- deprecated-postpublication -\&gt; emptied-postpublication- hidden-postpublication -\&gt; deprecated-postpublication- hidden-postpublication -\&gt; emptied-postpublicationA deprecated submission may or may not be succeeded by a new submission.Thereby, the new submission may reuse (a part of) the metadata from thedeprecated submission. The reused metadata including the alreadyexisting accessions is copied over to the new submission so that thecontents of the deprecated submission and the new submission can behandled independently, for instance, the deprecated submission beingemptied.### Event Sourcing to Generate ArtifactsTo implement the ETL processes that generate read-specific artifactsfrom the write-specific representation explained above, we propose anevent-sourcing mechanism.The creation and each status change of a given submission (andaccommodating changes to the submission\'s content) are translated intoevents. The events are cumulative and idempotent so you only have toconsume the latest event for a given submission in order to get thelatest state of that submission and a replay of the events will lead tothe same result. Thus, the event history only needs to keep the latestevent for each submission as implemented in the compacted topics offeredby Apache Kafka.Moreover, since submissions are self-contained and do not depend on thecontent of other submissions, events of different submissions can beprocessed independently.Multiple transformations (as in the ETL pattern) are applied to theseso-called source events to generate altered metadata representationsthat are in turn published as events. These derived events can be againsubjected to further transformations.Finally, the derived events are subject to load operations (as in theETL pattern) that aggregate the events and bring them into queryableformat (an artifact) that is accessible to users through an API.### Metadata Modeling and Model UpdatesMetadata requirements are modeled using LinkML. Thereby, the metadatamodel should take the whole metadata lifecycle into account so that itcan be used to validate metadata before and after the submission as wellas for all derived artifacts.Updates to the metadata model are classified into minor and major ones.For minor updates, existing submissions are automatically migrated. Thesubmission always stores metadata together with the used metadata model.The migration is realized through scripts that migrate metadata from anold version to a newer version. Multiple migration scripts may becombined to obtain a metadata representation that complies with thenewest version. The migration can be implemented as a transformationthat is applied to the source events as explained above.## DevelopmentFor setting up the development environment, we rely on the[devcontainer feature](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) of vscodein combination with Docker Compose.To use it, you have to have Docker Compose as well as vscode with its &quot;Remote - Containers&quot;extension (`ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers`) installed.Then open this repository in vscode and run the command`Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container` from the vscode &quot;Command Palette&quot;.This will give you a full-fledged, pre-configured development environment including:- infrastructural dependencies of the service (databases, etc.)- all relevant vscode extensions pre-installed- pre-configured linting and auto-formating- a pre-configured debugger- automatic license-header insertionMoreover, inside the devcontainer, a convenience commands `dev_install` is available.It installs the service with all development dependencies, installs pre-commit.The installation is performed automatically when you build the devcontainer. However,if you update dependencies in the [`./setup.cfg`](./setup.cfg) or the[`./requirements-dev.txt`](./requirements-dev.txt), please run it again.## LicenseThis repository is free to use and modify according to the[Apache 2.0 License](./LICENSE).## Readme GenerationThis readme is autogenerate, please see [`readme_generation.md`](./readme_generation.md)for details.</longdescription>

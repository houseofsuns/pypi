This image includes all of the optional dependencies and installation options.To install and run this image, run the following commands:```docker pull ghcr.io/biosimulators/biosimulatorsdocker run -it --rm ghcr.io/biosimulators/biosimulators```This image includes this package, as well as standardized Python APIs for the simulation tools validated by BioSimulators. Because this image aims to incorporate as many simulation tools as possible within a single Python environment, this image may sometimes lag behind the latest version of this package.The Dockerfile for this image is available [here](https://github.com/biosimulators/Biosimulators/blob/dev/Dockerfile).## Tutorials### Command-line interfaceA tutorial for the command-line interface is available [here](https://docs.biosimulators.org/Biosimulators_utils/).### Python APIInteractive tutorials for using BioSimulators-utils and Python APIs for simulation tools to execute simulations are available online from Binder [here](https://tutorial.biosimulators.org/). The Jupyter notebooks for these tutorials are also available [here](https://github.com/biosimulators/Biosimulators_tutorials).## API documentationAPI documentation is available [here](https://docs.biosimulators.org/Biosimulators_utils/).## LicenseThis package is released under the [MIT license](LICENSE).## Development teamThis package was developed by the [Karr Lab](https://www.karrlab.org) at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York and the [Center for Reproducible Biomedical Modeling](http://reproduciblebiomodels.org) with assistance from the contributors listed [here](CONTRIBUTORS.md).## Contributing to BioSimulators utilsWe enthusiastically welcome contributions to BioSimulators utils!

	<longdescription>trade=====| A paradigm for financial apps.| Copyright (c) 2015-2018 Rafael da Silva Rocha| https://python-trade.appspot.com| https://github.com/rochars/trade--------------| |Version| |Documentation| |Live Demo|| |Build| |Windows Build| |Coverage Status| |Scrutinizer| |cii|Installation------------pip install tradetrade-----**trade** implements a paradigm for financial apps where the operationsthemselves (called *occurrences*) are objects responsible for updatingthe state of an asset holder every time they occur.The asset holder state at a given timestamp may be loaded from a source(like a database) and then updated with a series of occurrences - raw operation data loaded as *Occurrence* objects. This outputs a new statefor the *Holder*.**trade** offers four classes: *Holder*, *Occurrence*, *Subject* and *Context*and defines the basic structure for a context-independent financial app. Theseclasses should be extended according to the needs of the app.It uses the concept of *holders*, *subjects*, *occurrences* and *contexts*--------------------------------------------------------------------------A *subject* is anything that can be traded.A *holder* is someone who owns subjects.A *holder* state is updated by *occurrences*.*Occurrences* may happen alone or in *contexts*.A *subject* is anything that can be traded------------------------------------------A *subject* may be the share of a corporation, livestock and so on.A *holder* is a entity that owns subjects-----------------------------------------A *holder* owns subjects. The *holder* state is updated by occurrences.A holder may hold none or many subjects.*Occurrences* happen with subjects and change the state of the *holder*-----------------------------------------------------------------------A *occurrence* may be caused by the *holder*, like the purchase of units of some*subject*. They can also represent other events, like a stock split.In both cases they should change the state of the *holder*.A *context* may have its own rules----------------------------------*Contexts* are groups of occurrences.*Contexts* are used to pre-process occurrences before informing them to a *holder*.A *context* may be a situation where daytrades should be identified, for example.A *context* may also involve taxes and other costs altering the details of the occurrences.Extending the framework-----------------------**trade** should be extended with new types of *occurrences*, *subjects* and *context rules*.The *holder* state signature can be defined according to the needs of the application.Live sample app---------------You can try it `live &lt;https://python-trade.appspot.com&gt;`_.This is a **sample app** built with **trade**. It runs as a service.The input is a JSON with *occurrences* and a initial statefor the *holder*.The sample app have *context tasks* to **identify daytrades** and more.The service also calculates the **profits** and **losses** from theoccurrences and **groups the results** by asset.The output is the *holder* state as a JSON.Use:----.. code:: pythonfrom trade.holder import Holderfrom trade.occurrence import Occurrencefrom trade.subject import Subject# create a holderholder = Holder()# define some subjectsome_asset = Subject('AST1')# create an occurrence with that subject.# In this example, a purchase of 100 units of the asset,# for the value of $20.some_occurrence = Occurrence(some_asset,'2018-01-02',{&quot;quantity&quot;: 100,&quot;value&quot;: 20})# pass it to the holderholder.trade(some_occurrence)# check the holder state:for subject, state in holder.state.items():print(subject)print(state)# AST1# {'value': 20.0, 'quantity': 100}Updating the holder state with a new occurrence:.. code:: python# create some other occurrence with that subject.# In this example, a sale of 20 units of the asset,# for the value of $30.holder.trade(Occurrence(some_asset,'2018-01-03',{&quot;quantity&quot;: -20,&quot;value&quot;: 30}))# check the holder state. It should show a change in quantity# and some profit:for subject, state in holder.state.items():print(subject)print(state)# AST1# {'value': 20.0, 'quantity': 80}More occurrences:.. code:: python# create some other occurrence with that subject.# Now a purchase of 10 units of the asset, for the# value of $20.holder.trade(Occurrence(some_asset,'2018-01-04',{&quot;quantity&quot;: 10,&quot;value&quot;: 25}))# check the holder state. It should show a change in quantity# and in the value of the subject:for subject, state in holder.state.items():print(subject)print(state)# AST1# {'value': 20.555555555555557, 'quantity': 90}About me--------I work as a consultant in the development of financial applications.Talk to me: rocha.rafaelsilva@gmail.comLicense-------Copyright (c) 2015-2018 Rafael da Silva RochaPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining acopy of this software and associated documentation files (the“Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, includingwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and topermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject tothe following conditions:The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be includedin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESSOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OFMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANYCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE... |Version| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/trade.svg?style=for-the-badge   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/trade/.. |Documentation| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/API-DOCS-blue.png?style=for-the-badge   :target: http://trade.readthedocs.org/en/latest/.. |Live Demo| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/try-live%20demo-blue.png?style=for-the-badge   :target: https://python-trade.appspot.com/.. |Build| image:: https://img.shields.io/travis/rochars/trade.svg?style=flat-square   :target: https://travis-ci.org/rochars/trade.. |Windows Build| image:: https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/rochars/trade.svg?logo=appveyor&amp;style=flat-square   :target: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/rochars/trade.. |Coverage Status| image:: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/github/rochars/trade/master.svg?style=flat-square   :target: https://coveralls.io/github/rochars/trade?branch=master.. |Scrutinizer| image:: https://img.shields.io/scrutinizer/g/rochars/trade.svg?style=flat-square   :target: https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/rochars/trade/.. |cii| image:: https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/1890/badge   :target: https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/1890</longdescription>

	<longdescription># g2pkkThis is a cross-platform g2p for Korean.g2pkk is a library that made [Kyubyong's g2pk](https://github.com/Kyubyong/g2pK) work in Windows.The reason why g2pk does not work well in Windows is that the `mecab`, the morpheme analyzer used by g2pk, causes build errors in Windows.g2pkk uses a different morpheme analyzer depending on the operating system.Windows uses [eunjeon](https://github.com/koshort/pyeunjeon), which enables mecab to be used in Windows, and other operating systems use [python-mecab-ko](https://github.com/jonghwanhyeon/python-mecab-ko), which was previously used in g2pk.Install g2pkk and make sure that a morpheme analyzer exists for the operating system of the system you are using for the first time, and if not, proceed with the installation automatically.## Requirements* python &gt;= 3.6* jamo* nltk## Installation```pip install g2pkk```## How To Useg2pkk uses same syntaxes as g2pk.```&gt;&gt;&gt; from g2pkk import G2p&gt;&gt;&gt; g2p = G2p(&quot;포상은 열심히 한 아이에게만 주어지기 때문에 포상인 것입니다.&quot;)&gt;&gt;&gt; g2p(&quot;포상으 녈심히 하 나이에게만 주어지기 때무네 포상인 거심니다.&quot;)```If you want more information, check [g2pk](https://github.com/Kyubyong/g2pK)</longdescription>

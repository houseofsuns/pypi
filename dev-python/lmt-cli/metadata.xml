	<longdescription># LMT: The CLI Tool for ChatGPT`lmt` is the primary tool of the [LLM-Toolbox](https://github.com/sderev/llm-toolbox) and a versatile command-line interface tool that allows you to interact directly with OpenAI's ChatGPT models. With `lmt`, you can bring the power of artificial intelligence to your terminal.As a crucial component of the LLM-Toolbox, `lmt` exemplifies the toolbox's dedication to providing powerful, flexible tools that harness the capabilities of language models. It allows access to all available models of ChatGPT, including gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-3.5-turbo-16k, gpt-4, and gpt-4-32k.Furthermore, `lmt` enables you to design and use your own templates, broadening its potential applications. The ability to read from `stdin` using pipes also allows for convenient integration with other command-line tools.If you find this project beneficial, consider expression your support by giving it a star ⭐😊.![cioran](https://github.com/sderev/lmt/assets/24412384/2e79cc97-903a-46ee-8a48-c5e42dbf7a63)&lt;!-- TOC --&gt;## Table of Contents1.

[Upcoming Features](#upcoming-features)&lt;!-- /TOC --&gt;## Features* **Access All ChatGPT Models**: `lmt` supports all available ChatGPT models (gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-3.5-turbo-16k, gpt-4, gpt-4-32k), giving you the power to choose the most suitable one for your task.* **Custom Templates**: Design and use your personalized toolbox of templates to streamline and automate your workflow.* **Read From `stdin`**: Using pipes, `lmt` can read from `stdin`, enabling you to use file content as a prompt.* **Command-Line &amp; Template Requests**: `lmt` offers the flexibility of making requests directly from the command line or using pre-designed templates.## Installation### `pip````bashpython3 -m pip install lmt-cli```### `pipx`, the Easy WayTo use these tools, I recommend that you first install [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/). It's a package manager for Python that makes the installation and upgrade of CLI apps easy (no more hassle with virtual environments 😌).* Debian / Ubuntu    ```bash    sudo apt install pipx    ```* macOS        ```bash    brew install pipx    ```### Installing `lmt` with `pipx`To install the latest stable version of `lmt`, simply run this command:```bashpipx install lmt-cli```If you want to follow the `main` branch:```bashpipx install git+https://github.com/sderev/lmt```To upgrade it:```bashpipx upgrade lmt-cli```### Cloning the `lmt` RepositoryYou can clone this repository with the following command:```bashgit clone https://github.com/sderev/lmt.git```## Getting Started### Set your OpenAI API keyLLM-Toolbox requires an OpenAI API key to function. You can obtain a key by signing up for an account at [OpenAI's website](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).You need to set some usage limit before to be able to use the API. You can configure on your OpenAI account in *Billing -&gt; Usage limits*.Once you have your API key, set it as an environment variable:* On macOS and Linux:  ```bash  export OPENAI_API_KEY=&quot;your-api-key-here&quot;  ```  To avoid having to type it everyday, you can create a file with the key:  ```bash  echo &quot;your-api-key&quot; &gt; ~/.openai-api-key.txt  ```  **Note:** Remember to replace `&quot;your-api-key&quot;` with your actual API key.  And then, you can add this to your shell configuration file (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.):    ```bash    export OPENAI_API_KEY=&quot;$(cat ~/.openai-api-key.txt)&quot;    ```* On Windows:  ```  setx OPENAI_API_KEY your_key  ```## Usage## UsageThe `lmt` CLI tool is equipped with a helpful `--help` flag that displays useful information about how to use the tool and its commands.**For a general overview of all commands, you can type**:```bashlmt --help```**If you want detailed information about a specific command, such as `prompt`, you can display its help message like so**:```bashlmt prompt --help```### Basic ExampleThe simplest way to use `lmt` is by entering a prompt for the model to respond to.**Here's a basic usage example where we ask the model to generate a greeting**:```bashlmt prompt &quot;Say hello&quot;```In this case, the model will generate and return a greeting based on the given prompt.### Add a PersonaYou can also instruct the model to adopt a specific persona using the `--system` flag. This is useful when you want the model's responses to emulate a certain character or writing style.**Here's an example where we instruct the model to write like the philosopher Cioran**:```bashlmt prompt &quot;Tell me what you think of large language models.&quot; \        --system &quot;You are Cioran. You write like Cioran.&quot;```In this case, the model will generate a response based on its understanding of Cioran's writing style and perspective.### Switching ModelsSure, here's a reviewed and slightly enhanced version of your text:### Switching ModelsSwitching between different models is a breeze with `lmt`. Use the `-m` flag followed by the alias of the model you wish to employ.```bashlmt prompt &quot;Explain what is a large language model&quot; -m 4```Below is a table outlining available model aliases for your convenience:| Alias | Corresponding Model || --- | --- || chatgpt | gpt-3.5-turbo || chatgpt-16k | gpt-3.5-turbo-16k || 3.5 | gpt-3.5-turbo || 3.5-16k | gpt-3.5-turbo-16k || 4 | gpt-4 || gpt4 | gpt-4 || 4-32k | gpt-4-32k || gpt4-32k | gpt-4-32k |For instance, if you want to use the `gpt-4-32k` model, simply include `-m 4-32k` in your command.### Template UtilizationTemplates, stored in `~/.config/lmt/templates` and written in YAML, can be effortlessly generated using the following command:```bashlmt templates add```**For help regarding the `templates` subcommand, use**:```bashlmt templates --help```**Here's an example of invoking a template named &quot;cioran&quot;**:```bashlmt prompt &quot;Tell me how AI will change the world.&quot; --template cioran```### Emoji IntegrationTo infuse a touch of emotion into your requests, append the `--emoji` flag option.### Prompt Cost EstimationFor an estimation of your prompt's cost before sending, utilize the `--tokens` flag option.### Reading from stdin`lmt` facilitates reading inputs directly from `stdin`, allowing you to pipe in the content of a file as a prompt. This feature can be particularly useful when dealing with longer or more complex prompts, or when you want to streamline your workflow by incorporating `lmt` into a larger pipeline of commands.To use this feature, you simply need to pipe your content into the `lmt` command like this:```bashcat your_file.txt | lmt prompt```In this example, `lmt` would use the content of `your_file.txt` as the input for the `prompt` command.Also, remember that you can still use all other command line options with `stdin`. For instance, you might run:```bashcat your_file.py | lmt prompt \        --system &quot;You explain code in the style of \        a fast-talkin' wise guy from a 1940's gangster movie&quot; \        -m 4 --emoji```In this example, `lmt` takes the content of `your_file.py` as the input for the `prompt` command. With the `gpt-4` model selected via `-m 4`, the system is instructed to respond in the style of a fast-talking wiseguy from a 1940s gangster movie, as specified in the `--system` option. The `--emoji` flag indicates that the response may include emojis for added expressiveness.### Output RedirectionYou can use output redirections with the tools. For instance:```bashlmt prompt &quot;List 5 Wikipedia articles&quot; --raw &gt; wiki_articles.md```## License`lmt` is licensed under Apache License version 2.0.## Upcoming FeaturesWhile `lmt` already boasts a wide array of features, development is ongoing. Expect more features and improvements in the future!___&lt;https://github.com/sderev/lmt&gt;</longdescription>

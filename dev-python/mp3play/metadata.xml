	<longdescription>------------mp3play------------  Allows your Windows Python program to play and stop MP3s, without opening  an external player or requiring any external programs.  A very simple  interface for the common case (playing an entire MP3), with an API for  more complex tasks (e.g. playing from seconds 30 to 45 of an MP3).  Note: if you are looking for complex cross-platform audio control, try  pyglet.  After easy_installing pyglet, it requires a separate manual  installation of AVlib libraries, which is why I wrote mp3play as an  easy_installable alternative.Example=======  Play the first 30 seconds of a file::    import mp3play    filename = r'C:\Documents and Settings\Michael\Desktop\music.mp3'    clip = mp3play.load(filename)    clip.play()    import time    time.sleep(min(30, clip.seconds()))    clip.stop()Requirements============  Requires Windows XP at the moment, but the goal is to make a  cross-platform module.  Feel free to send patches to add Linux and  Mac support!  Note that the module's purpose is to be easy_installable  with no other work needed by the user, so things like AVLib are out unless  that can be easy_installed automatically alongside mp3play.Resources=========  * Homepage: http://mp3play.googlecode.com/  * Source:    - Browse at http://code.google.com/p/mp3play/source/browse/trunk/    - Get with **svn co http://mp3play.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/      mp3play-read-only**  Please let me know if you like or use this module - it would make  my day!</longdescription>

Cardboardlint is able to report just those messages relatedto lines that have changed in your development branch, compared to anothercommit, e.g. the HEAD of the master branch. This is intended to make life easierfor contributors to a project: in their pull requests, they will only seelinting issues related to the code they have touched. For some linters,cardboardlint also supports automatic fixes of linting issues, optionallyrestricted to code that has changed in your development branch.Some example projects that use Cardboardlint:- Cardboardlint, obviously- Roberto: https://github.com/theochem/roberto (Cardboardlint also uses Roberto.)- IOData: https://github.com/theochem/iodata- CellCutoff: https://github.com/theochem/cellcutoff- CGrid: https://github.com/theochem/cgridUsage------ Install cardboardlint, which requires python 3.6 or 3.7 and PyYaml. You must  have Python 3 installed, PyYaml will be installed automatically for you with  the instructions below.  .. code:: bash      # Install cardboardlint with pip. Any of the following that works for you      # is fine:      pip install cardboardlint      pip install cardboardlint --user      python3 -m pip install cardboardlint      python3 -m pip install cardboardlint --user      # Or install cardboardlint with conda:      conda install theochem::cardboardlint- Add a ``.cardboardlint.yml`` to the root of your source tree. It should at least contain  a ``linters`` section with a list of linters, e.g.  .. code:: yaml      linters:      - pylint:          pylintrc: tools/your_custom_pylintrc      - cppcheck:      - import:      ...  A list of supported linters is easily deduced from the source code. Just look into  the ``cardboardlint/linter_*.py`` files. Each of these files has a module docstring with  some explanations and a DEFAULT_CONFIG dictionary with the available configuration vars.  You can repeat any linter multiple times with different configuration settings. This can  be useful, e.g. when unit tests must be linted differently than the rest of the source  code. This is a simple example where unit tests have a different pylint config:  .. code:: yaml      pre_filefilter: ['+ tools/demo/*.py', '- tools/*', '+ *']      linters:      - pylint:          pylintrc: tools/pylintrc          filefilter: ['- test_*.py', '+ *.py']          exclude:      - pylint:          pylintrc: tools/pylintrc_tests          filefilter: ['+ test_*.py']      - import:      ...  When cardboardlint starts, it makes a list of files not ignored by  git in the current repository. These filenames are first filtered by a  so-called ``pre_filefilter``. Files that pass the ``pre_filefilter`` are then  tested with linter-specific ``filefilters`` to end up with a list of files to  be checked by a given linter.  A ``pre_filefilter`` or ``filefilter`` consists of a list of rules to test if  a file should be considered for linting or not. Each rule starts with a  possible outcome, ``+`` (include) or a ``-`` (exclude), followed by a glob  pattern. At the moment, the pattern ignores the presence of directory  separators and treats the complete path as a single string on which the  pattern is tested, using Pythons ``fnmatch`` builtin module. The rules are  tested in order and when a pattern matches, the corresponding decision is made  (include and exclude), without considering subsequent rules. When no patterns  give a match, the file is excluded.  The following tricks might be useful:  - If you would like to include files that did not match any pattern, add    ``'+ *'`` as last pattern, which is often useful for the ``pre_filefilter``.  - If you would like to include all python files, in all directories, use    ``'+ *.py'``. The wildcard will also match directories containing the Python    file. For example it would match ``a/b`` in the path ``a/b.py``.- Install the linters you intend to run (either locally or in your CI environment). These  dependencies are not installed automatically because you may not want to use all of  them.  Conda packages for all supported linters can be found in the main conda  channels an in conda-forge (https://anaconda.org/conda-forge). We have added  packages to conda-forge for ``cppcheck`` and ``cpplint``. All other linters  were already available. To install all of them, we can recommend the following  commands:  .. code:: bash    # Add conda-forga channel with lower priority as the default channels. This    # prevents your conda env from being flooded by conda-forga packages.    conda config --append channels conda-forge    # Install all linters for which cardboardlint has wrappers:    conda install pycodestyle pydocstyle cppcheck cpplint yamllint flake8 \                  doxygen pylint autopep8, yapf, black- Run the cardboardlinter, which can be done in several ways:  .. code:: bash    # runs all linters and use multiple cpus    cardboardlinter -n auto    # runs all linters and only shows messages for changes relative to master    cardboardlinter -r master    # run only static linters    cardboardlinter -f static    # run only dynamic linters, which require in-place build    cardboardlinter -f dynamic    # run fixers, which automaticaly solve trivial problems    cardboardlinter -F    # run fixers, which automaticaly solve trivial problems, only on those    # lines that have changed w.r.t. the master branch.    cardboardlinter -F -r master- Usage in CI:  - Travis-CI (in ``.travis.yml``). This will only report messages for lines that have    changed in the PR.    .. code:: yaml        install:        # Install the latest cardboardlinter        - if [ &quot;$TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST&quot; != &quot;false&quot; ]; then            pip install --upgrade cardboardlint          fi        script:        # Run the cardboardlinter, in case of pull requests        - if [ &quot;$TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST&quot; != &quot;false&quot; ]; then            cardboardlinter --refspec $TRAVIS_BRANCH -n auto;          fi  - One can also use Roberto to drive the entire build+test+package workflow,    which includes linting with Cardboardlint.    See https://theochem.github.io/roberto/Change log----------- Version 1.3.1 August 26, 2020  - Improve interaction with Roberto.  - Hide duplicate messages.- Version 1.3.0 April 14, 2019  - More verbose output. List of selected files for linting is always shown.  - Fix default location for Python command-line scripts is ./bin, not ./scripts.  - Wall time of linters is printed.  - Few cleanups.- Version 1.2.0 April 12, 2019  - Added support for fixers. The following liners can also fix problems:    header, whitespace, autopep8, yapf, black. The latter three are new.  - Removed some Python-2 compatibility code.  - Replace nosetests by pytest.  - Add more context to README.  - Add RST linter.- Version 1.1.0 April 3, 2019  - Add option for number of processors to use.- Version 1.0.1 March 30, 2019  - Add missing config options for cpplint.- Version 1.0.0 March 27, 2019  First release, mainly in anticipation of API-breaking changes, which will  result in a major version increase. By making a release, we can handle this  change in API gracefully. Notable features include:  - Support for the following linters: cppcheck, ccplint, doxygen, flake8,    header (internal), import (internal), namespace (internal), pycodestyle,    pydocstyle, pylint, whitespace (internal), yamllint  - For all supported linters, the output can be restricted to files and (lines    in those files) that have changed between two git commits. In pull requests,    this will then only show errors that are relevant for the code touched in    the PR. This is intended for making life easy for contributors, i.e. to not    bother them with linting issues in code they have not touched.  - Flexible file filtering, essentially a simplified version of rsync's file    filtering rules.  - Consistent and colored output for all linters, making it easy to process    linting issues.</longdescription>

	<longdescription>## `kbib`: The perfect companion for effortless reference management[![Alt text](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/kbib.svg?logo=pypi)](https://pypi.org/project/kbib/)[![Alt text](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/kbib.svg?logo=python)](https://pypi.org/project/kbib/)[![Alt text](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/kbib.svg)](https://pypistats.org/packages/kbib)[![Alt text](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/kbib.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/kbib/)[![Alt text](https://img.shields.io/pypi/status/kbib.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/kbib/)[![Alt text](https://github.com/koushikphy/kbib/actions/workflows/python-publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Koushikphy/kbib/releases/latest)When writing a research article, managing a large number of references to other articles, books, and other sources can be a challenging task. It involves tasks such as copying citations from journal pages, ensuring accuracy and correctness, and avoiding repetitions. This process can be time-consuming and prone to errors.To address these challenges, I would like to introduce a command-line utility called **`kbib`**. This tool is designed to help researchers manage their references easily and efficiently. With **`kbib`**, you can streamline the process of organizing and formatting citations, saving you valuable time and effort.### ⚡ Features1. Get bibtex information from DOI.2. Get bibtex information from article pdf.3. Get full list of references of an article as a .bib file.4. Directly rename pdf files with bibtex information.5. Find duplicate bib entries in Tex/Bib files.### 🛠️ InstallationDownload and install the latest package from the [release section](https://github.com/Koushikphy/kbib/releases/latest) or directly by pip```bashpip install kbib```For parsing bibtex information from PDF files, optional dependencies need to be installed```bashpip install kbib['pdf']```### 🚀 Usage https://github.com/Koushikphy/kbib/assets/43264301/50bbcf78-e426-4937-8ebd-a58e424f61bdUse the command line tool `kbib` as ```bashkbib [-h] [-bib DOI] [-ref DOI] [-pdf [PDF [PDF ...]]] [-ren [PDF [PDF ...]]] [-dup [BIB [BIB ...]]] [-o DOI]```| Argument    |  Description|| ----------- | ----------- |    `-bib`    | DOI to get bibtex entry ||    `-ref`    | DOI to get bibtex entries for all the references | |    `-pdf`    | PDF file name(s) to get bibtex info | |    `-ren`    | PDF file name(s) to rename with bibtex info | |    `-dup`    | Bib/Tex file name(s) to find duplicates. | |    `-o`      | Output bib file | #### Use cases* Get bibtex from a DOI    ```bash    kbib -bib https://doi.org/10xxxxxx    ```* Get bibtex from a DOI and store in a file 'ref.bib'    ```bash    kbib -bib https://doi.org/10xxxxxx -o ref.bib    ```* Get the full reference list of an article as bibtex entries and save as ref.bib    ```bash    kbib -ref https://doi.org/10xxxxxx -o ref.bib    ```* Get bibtex from a PDF named article.pdf    ```bash    kbib -pdf article.pdf    ```* Get bibtex from all pdfs in the current folder    ```bash    kbib -pdf *.pdf    ```* Rename pdf files with bibtex information    ```bash    kbib -ren article.pdf    # or    kbib -ren *.pdf    ```* Find duplicate bib entries in bibtex files.    ```bash    kbib -dup article_1.bib article_2.bib    ```* If a .tex file is provided, it will find the duplicates that are cited in the tex file    ```bash    kbib -dup article.tex article_1.bib article_2.bib    ```#### ⚓Limitation:- `kbib` parses DOI information from [Crossref API](https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc). So if the article is not indexed in Crossref database this tool will fail to get the necessary information. Also the API may temporarily block requests from an IP if a large number of queries are made within a short period of time.- Special/Latex characters in the title may gets messed up during the API call. One needs to be careful using title field for the bibtex created by `kbib`.- For bibtex keys and renaming files, `kbib` uses format as `&lt;Short Journal Name&gt;_&lt;Volume&gt;_&lt;Year&gt;_&lt;Last name of first author&gt;`, which is presently hardcoded in the tool. Therefore, one can not use any desired format through the command line.#### ⏳ Work-in-Progress:- Concurrent/Parallel API calls for faster parsing of bibtex information.</longdescription>

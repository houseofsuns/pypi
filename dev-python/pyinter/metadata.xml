	<longdescription>=======Pyinter=======..    |latestversion| |downloads| |masterstatus| |mastercover| |issuecount|..Pyinter is a small and simple library written in Python for performing interval and discontinous range arithmetic... code-block:: pycon    &gt;&gt;&gt; pyinter.openclosed(1.1, 12)    (1.1, 12]    &gt;&gt;&gt; discontinous_range = pyinter.IntervalSet([pyinter.closedopen(5, 10), pyinter.closed(22, 23)])    &gt;&gt;&gt; discontinous_range    IntervalSet([5, 10), [22, 23])    &gt;&gt;&gt; 7 in discontinous_range    True    &gt;&gt;&gt; 10 in discontinous_range    False  # This isn't in the range as it is an open interval which doesn't include its end pointsFeatures---------  interval objects which can be   -  unioned   -  intersected   -  easily constructed using helper functions: *open, closed, openclosed and closedopen*-  interval sets which can be   -  unioned   -  intersectedInstallation------------To install Pyinter, simply:.. code-block:: bash    $ pip install pyinterOr, if you absolutely must:.. code-block:: bash    $ easy_install pyinterBut I'm told you really shouldn't do that.Documentation-------------Documentation is available at http://pyinter.readthedocs.org.Contribute----------Contributions or suggestions for improvements are welcome... |masterstatus| image:: http://img.shields.io/travis/intiocean/pyinter/master.svg?style=flat    :target: https://travis-ci.org/intiocean/pyinter    :alt: Release Build Status.. |developstatus| image:: http://img.shields.io/travis/intiocean/pyinter/develop.svg?style=flat    :target: https://travis-ci.org/intiocean/pyinter    :alt: Development Build Status.. |latestversion| image:: http://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pyinter.svg?style=flat    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyinter    :alt: Latest Version.. |downloads| image:: http://img.shields.io/pypi/dw/pyinter.svg?style=flat    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyinter    :alt: Downloads per Week.. |mastercover| image:: http://img.shields.io/coveralls/intiocean/pyinter/master.svg?style=flat    :target: https://travis-ci.org/intiocean/pyinter    :alt: Release Test Coverage.. |developcover| image:: http://img.shields.io/coveralls/intiocean/pyinter/develop.svg?style=flat    :target: https://travis-ci.org/intiocean/pyinter    :alt: Development Test Coverage.. |issuecount| image:: http://img.shields.io/github/issues/intiocean/pyinter.svg?style=flat    :target: https://github.com/intiocean/pyinter/issues    :alt: Github Issues.. :changelog:Release History---------------0.2.0 (2019-05-14)++++++++++++++++++- Fix: The interval of 2 identical numbers equals the empty set if one of the boundaries is open #20- Improvement: Add lower and upper properties and replace method which works similarly to date.replace #190.1.9 (2015-08-01)++++++++++++++++++- Fix empty interval types so that empty intervals could be compared with other intervals- Add method `copy()` to create new `Interval` instances with the same bounds and values as the `Interval` being copied- Fix method `overlaps` on `Interval` and add tests for it!0.1.8 (2015-07-14)++++++++++++++++++- Fix formatting in README.rst as pypi isn't rendering it properly.0.1.7 (2015-07-14)++++++++++++++++++- Fix `|` and `&amp;` in the documentation.- Implement subtraction of `Interval`'s and `IntervalSet`'s- Add method `empty()` to detect empty `Interval` objects.- Fix, each infinity should always equal itself.0.1.6 (2014-05-11)++++++++++++++++++- Add a complement function- Fix bug with using &amp; and | for `union()` and `intersection()`- Increase test coverage!0.1.5 (2013-12-13)++++++++++++++++++- Fix the `__all__` list so that you can `from pyinter import *`.- Change classes to new style classes (inheriting from object)- Added an `add()` function to the `IntervalSet` class. This will add (union) an Interval inplace. (similarly to `set().add()`)- The optional iterable of Interval objects passed when initialising an `IntervalSet` is now added Interval by Interval so that initialising with overlapping intervals works as expected.0.1.4 (2013-11-16)++++++++++++++++++- Fix formatting in HISTORY.rst which was stopping the pypi page rendering it.0.1.3 (2013-11-16)++++++++++++++++++- Removed \*.md from the MANIFEST file as it warns when installing that no files matching \*.md are found.- Fix allowing an IntervalSet to be initialised with a generator.0.1.2 (2013-10-12)++++++++++++++++++- Fixed the rendering of the README on pypi (hopefully!) by converting it from a .md file to a .rst file.0.1.1 (2013-10-09)++++++++++++++++++- Adding Manifest file to fix the pypi release. This was broken because the README.md was not being included in the source distribution but setup.py had a reference to this file and therefore failed to run.0.1.0 (2013-07-03)++++++++++++++++++- Initial release</longdescription>

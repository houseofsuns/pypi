Use it at your own risks.Here's the roadmap to 1.0 release and our current status:- [x] define a `backquote var` in `set_env` with a `backquoted expression`      (and nothing else) and evaluate it through bash, inside the tox virtual      environment.- [x] Make of a `backquote var` usable in commands section.- [x] Allow another variable to be referenced inside the `backquoted      expression`- [x] Strip the trailing newline characters of the `backquoted expression`- [ ] Allow user configure the evaluation of `backquote expression` to be with      a shell or not (either fork the command directly, either fork a shell      and evaluate a possible-complex shell expression)- [ ] Allow a `backquote var` value to contain regular string parts and a      `backquote expression`- [ ] Allow a `backquote var` value to contain more than one `backquote      expression`- [ ] Allow user to configure if we should strip the trailing newline      characters or not.- [x] Allow another variable to reuse the evaluated `backquoted expression`- [x] Allow another variable to reuse the evaluated `backquoted expression`      without reevaluating it :) (I mean, it's hacked, but heh, better than      nothing)- [x] If evaluating through a shell, automatically add said shell to      `allowlist_externals` section- [x] Have a working package- [ ] Write user documentation</longdescription>

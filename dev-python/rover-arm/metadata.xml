	<longdescription>A OpenAI Gym Env for Rover with ArmProject Overview - https://1drv.ms/p/s!Aswo8fN5BKr61klitElDnhZ-JARqTask1 - Move the cart near the table and pick up the object in the trayReward = 1 (when the object is picked up)(Else) If the bot gets close to the object it gets a small positive reward (say 0.001) and if it gets far it gets a negative reward (say -0.001).Code with Sample Actions```import rover_armimport gymnasium as gymenv = gym.make('rover-arm-pick-v1', render_mode = 'rgb_array')observation = env.reset()done = Falsewhile not done:    action = env.action_space.sample()    observation, reward, terminated, truncated,  info = env.step(action)    done = terminated or truncated    img = env.render()    # print(img.shape)    print(action, observation, reward)    print(reward, done, info)```You can try to explore the environment and action space by controlling the bot using Keyboard.You will have to install the dev version in local, and give keyboard access to terminal or IDE where code is being executed. To install in dev version you could do```pip install 'rover-arm[dev]'```Keyboard ControlsRoverUp, Down, Left, Right Arrows to steer the Rover.  ArmA, D -&gt; Move the end-effector in X-axisW, S -&gt; Move the end-effector in Y-axisQ, E -&gt; Move the end-effector in Z-axis-, + -&gt; Open / Close the fingers of the robot armNote: W, S are also hot keys to adjust view in pybullet env (so ignore the changes or press again to undo the change.)Code to control the bot using keyboard in human mode (needs to be run in local)```import rover_armimport gymnasium as gymimport rover_arm.keyboard_control as kcenv = gym.make('rover-arm-pick-v1', render_mode = 'human')keyboard_controller = kc.KeyboardAction()keyboard_controller.start_listening()observation = env.reset()done = Falsewhile not done:    action = keyboard_controller.action    observation, reward, terminated, truncated,  info = env.step(action)    done = terminated or truncated    img = env.render()    # print(img.shape)    print(action, observation, reward)    print(reward, done, info)```Task2: Pick the object from the closer tray and place it on the distant tray Use the env &quot;rover-arm-place-v1&quot; for task2```env = gym.make('rover-arm-place-v1')```Note: Task2 Env is not upto date, it uses gym style instead of gymnasium, so expect done instead of truncated and terminated.</longdescription>

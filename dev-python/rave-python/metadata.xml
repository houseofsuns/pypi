Flutterwave for business [API Keys](https://developer.flutterwave.com/docs/integration-guides/authentication)2. Acceptable Python versions: &gt;=2.7, !=3.0.\*, !=3.1.\*, !=3.2.\*, !=3.3.\*, !=3.4.\*## InstallationTo install the library, run```shpip install rave_python```Note: This is currently under active development## Initialization### Import PackageThe base class for this package is 'Rave'. To use this class, add:```pyfrom rave_python import Rave```#### To instantiate in sandbox:To use Rave, instantiate the Rave class with your public key. We recommend that you store your secret key in an environment variable named, ```RAVE_SECRET_KEY```. Instantiating your rave object is therefore as simple as:```pyrave = Rave(&quot;YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY&quot;)```####  To instantiate without environment variables (Sandbox):If you choose not to store your secret key in an environment variable, we do provide a ```usingEnv``` flag which can be set to ```False```, but please be warned, do not use this package without environment variables in production```pyrave = Rave(&quot;YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY&quot;, &quot;YOUR_SECRET_KEY&quot;, usingEnv = False)```#### To instantiate in production:To initialize in production, simply set the ```production``` flag to ```True```. It is highly discouraged but if you choose to not use environment variables, you can do so in the same way mentioned above.```pyrave = Rave(&quot;YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY&quot;, production=True)```# UsageThis is the documentation for all of the components of rave_python## ```rave.Card```This is used to facilitate card transactions.**Functions included:*** ```.charge```* ```.validate```* ```.verify```* ```.refund```* ```.getTypeOfArgsRequired```* ```.updatePayload```&lt;br&gt;### ```.charge(payload)```This is called to start a card transaction. The payload should be a dictionary containing card information. It should have the parameters:* ```cardno```,* ```cvv```, * ```currency```, * ```country```, * ```expirymonth```, * ```expiryyear```, * ```amount```, * ```email```, * ```phonenumber```,* ```firstname```, * ```lastname```, * ```IP```Optionally, you can add a custom transaction reference using the ```txRef``` parameter. Note that if you do not specify one, it would be automatically generated. We do provide a function for generating transaction references in the [Misc library](https://github.com/Flutterwave/rave-python/blob/master/rave_python/rave_misc.py).A sample call is:```pyres = rave.Card.charge(payload)```#### ReturnsThis call returns a dictionary. A sample response is:```py {'validationRequired': True, 'suggestedAuth': u'PIN', 'flwRef': None, 'authUrl': None, 'error': False, 'txRef': 'MC-1538095398058'} ```This call raises a ```CardChargeError``` if there was a problem processing your transaction. The ```CardChargeError``` contains some information about your transaction. You can handle this as such:```pytry:     #Your charge callexcept RaveExceptions.CardChargeError as e:    print(e.err[&quot;errMsg&quot;])    print(e.err[&quot;flwRef&quot;])```A sample ``` e.err ``` contains:```py{'error': True, 'txRef': 'MC-1530897824739', 'flwRef': None, 'errMsg': 'Sorry, that card number is invalid, please check and try again'}```&lt;br&gt;### ```rave.Misc.updatePayload(authMethod, payload, arg)```Depending on the suggestedAuth from the charge call, you may need to update the payload with a pin or address. To know which type of authentication you would require, simply call ```rave.Card.getTypeOfArgsRequired(suggestedAuth)```. This returns either ```pin``` or ```address```. In the case of ```pin```, you are required to call ```rave.Card.updatePayload(suggestedAuth, payload, pin=&quot;THE_CUSTOMER_PIN&quot;)```. In the case of ```address```, you are required to call ```rave.Card.updatePayload(suggestedAuth, payload, address={ THE_ADDRESS_DICTIONARY })```A typical address dictionary includes the following parameters:```billingzip```, ```billingcity```,```billingaddress```,  ```billingstate```, ```billingcountry```**Note:**```suggestedAuth``` is the suggestedAuth returned from the initial charge call and ```payload``` is the original payload&lt;br&gt;### ```.validate(txRef)```After a successful charge, most times you will be asked to verify with OTP. To check if this is required, check the ```validationRequired``` key in the ```res``` of the charge call.To validate, you need to pass the ```flwRef``` from the ```res``` of the charge call as well as the OTP.A sample validate call is: ```pyres2 = rave.Card.validate(res[&quot;flwRef&quot;], &quot;12345&quot;)```#### ReturnsThis call returns a dictionary containing the ```txRef```, ```flwRef``` among others if successful. This call raises a ```TransactionValidationError``` if the OTP is not correct or there was a problem processing your request. To handle this, write:```pytry:    # Your charge callexcept RaveExceptions.TransactionValidationError as e:    print(e.err[&quot;errMsg&quot;])    print(e.err[&quot;flwRef&quot;])```A sample ``` e.err ``` contains:```py{'error': True, 'txRef': None, 'flwRef': 'FLW-MOCK-a7911408bd7f55f89f0211819d6fd370', 'errMsg': 'otp is required'}```&lt;br&gt;### ```.verify(txRef)```You can call this to check if your transaction was completed successfully. You have to pass the transaction reference generated at the point of charging. This is the ```txRef``` in the ```res``` parameter returned any of the calls (```charge``` or ```validate```). A sample verify call is:```pyres = rave.Card.verify(data[&quot;txRef&quot;])```#### ReturnsThis call returns a dict with ```txRef```, ```flwRef``` and ```transactionComplete``` which indicates whether the transaction was completed successfully. Sample```py{'flwRef': None, 'cardToken': u'flw-t1nf-5b0f12d565cd961f73c51370b1340f1f-m03k', 'chargedAmount': 100, 'amount': 100, 'transactionComplete': True, 'error': False, 'txRef': u'MC-1538095718251'}```&gt; Please note that after charging a card successfully on rave, if you wish to save the card for further charges, in your verify payment response you will find an object: `&quot;cardtoken&quot;: &quot;flw-t0-f6f915f53a094671d98560272572993e-m03k&quot;`.  This is the token you will use for card tokenization. Details are provided below.If your call could not be completed successfully, a ```TransactionVerificationError``` is raised.&lt;br&gt;### ```.charge(payload_for_saved_card, chargeWithToken=True)```This is called to start a card transaction with a card that has been saved. The payload should be a dictionary containing card information. It should have the parameters:* ```token```,* ```country```, * ```amount```, * ```email```, * ```firstname```, * ```lastname```, * ```IP```,* ```txRef```, * ```currency```#### NB: email must be the same as before the card was savedOptionally, you can add a custom transaction reference using the ```txRef``` parameter. Note that if you do not specify one, it would be automatically generated. We do provide a function for generating transaction references in the [Misc library](https://github.com/Flutterwave/rave-python/blob/master/rave_python/rave_misc.py).A sample call is:```pyres = rave.Card.charge(payload_for_saved_card, chargeWithToken=True)```#### ReturnsThis call returns a dictionary. A sample response is: ```py {'status': u'success', 'validationRequired': False, 'suggestedAuth': None, 'flwRef': u'FLW-M03K-cdb24d740fb18c242dd277fb1f74d399', 'authUrl': None, 'error': False, 'txRef': 'MC-7666-YU'} ``` This call raises a ```CardChargeError``` if a wrong token or email is passed or if there was a problem processing your transaction. The ```CardChargeError``` contains some information about your transaction. You can handle this as such:```pytry:     #Your charge callexcept RaveExceptions.CardChargeError as e:    print(e.err[&quot;errMsg&quot;])    print(e.err[&quot;flwRef&quot;])```This call also raises an ```IncompletePaymentDetailsError``` if any of the required parameters are missing. The ```IncompletePaymentDetailsError``` contains information about which parameter was not included in the payload. You can handle this such as:```pytry:    #Your charge callexcept RaveExceptions.IncompletePaymentDetailsError as e:    print(e.err[&quot;errMsg&quot;])```Once this is done, call ```rave.Card.verify``` passing in the ```txRef``` returned in the response to verify the payment. Sample response:```py{'flwRef': None, 'cardToken': u'flw-t1nf-5b0f12d565cd961f73c51370b1340f1f-m03k', 'chargedAmount': 1000, 'amount': 1000, 'transactionComplete': True, 'error': False, 'txRef': 'MC-7666-YU'}``````rave.Card.verify``` raises a ```TransactionVerificationError``` if an invalid ```txRef``` is supplied. You can handle this as such:```pytry:     #Your charge callexcept RaveExceptions.CardChargeError as e:    print(e.err[&quot;errMsg&quot;])    print(e.err[&quot;flwRef&quot;])```#### NB: when charging saved cards, you do not need to call rave.card.Validate()### ```.refund(flwRef, amount)```You can call this to refund a full or partial amount of a transaction that was completed successfully. You have to pass the flw reference generated at the point of verifing the transaction. This is the ```flwRef``` in the ```res``` parameter returned any of the calls (```charge``` or ```validate```). A sample verify call is:```pyres = rave.Card.refund(data[&quot;flwRef&quot;], amount)```#### ReturnsThis call returns a dict with ```status```, ```AmountRefunded```, ```disburse_ref``` and ```disburse_status``` which indicates whether the transaction was completed successfully. Sample```py(True, {'settlement_id': 'NEW', 'id': 36071, 'AccountId': 49278, 'TransactionId': 1664979, 'FlwRef': 'FLW-MOCK-62986ef948d6dd127102cdb58813d216', 'walletId': 50309, 'AmountRefunded': '5000', 'status': 'completed', 'destination': 'payment_source', 'meta': '{&quot;source&quot;:&quot;ledgerbalance&quot;,&quot;uniquereference&quot;:&quot;62472228710&quot;}', 'updatedAt': '2021-01-23T01:27:11.969Z', 'createdAt': '2021-01-23T01:27:08.672Z'})```### Complete card charge flow```pyfrom rave_python import Rave, RaveExceptions, Miscrave = Rave(&quot;YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY&quot;, &quot;YOUR_SECRET_KEY&quot;, usingEnv = False)# Payload with pinpayload = {  &quot;cardno&quot;: &quot;5438898014560229&quot;,  &quot;cvv&quot;: &quot;890&quot;,  &quot;expirymonth&quot;: &quot;09&quot;,  &quot;expiryyear&quot;: &quot;19&quot;,  &quot;amount&quot;: &quot;10&quot;,  &quot;email&quot;: &quot;user@gmail.com&quot;,  &quot;phonenumber&quot;: &quot;0902620185&quot;,  &quot;firstname&quot;: &quot;temi&quot;,  &quot;lastname&quot;: &quot;desola&quot;,  &quot;IP&quot;: &quot;355426087298442&quot;,}try:    res = rave.Card.charge(payload)    if res[&quot;suggestedAuth&quot;]:        arg = Misc.getTypeOfArgsRequired(res[&quot;suggestedAuth&quot;])        if arg == &quot;pin&quot;:            Misc.updatePayload(res[&quot;suggestedAuth&quot;], payload, pin=&quot;3310&quot;)        if arg == &quot;address&quot;:            Misc.updatePayload(res[&quot;suggestedAuth&quot;], payload, address= {&quot;billingzip&quot;: &quot;07205&quot;, &quot;billingcity&quot;: &quot;Hillside&quot;, &quot;billingaddress&quot;: &quot;470 Mundet PI&quot;, &quot;billingstate&quot;: &quot;NJ&quot;, &quot;billingcountry&quot;: &quot;US&quot;})                res = rave.Card.charge(payload)    if res[&quot;validationRequired&quot;]:        rave.Card.validate(res[&quot;flwRef&quot;], &quot;&quot;)    res = rave.Card.verify(res[&quot;txRef&quot;])    print(res[&quot;transactionComplete&quot;])except RaveExceptions.CardChargeError as e:    print(e.err[&quot;errMsg&quot;])    print(e.err[&quot;flwRef&quot;])except RaveExceptions.TransactionValidationError as e:    print(e.err)    print(e.err[&quot;flwRef&quot;])except RaveExceptions.TransactionVerificationError as e:    print(e.err[&quot;errMsg&quot;])    print(e.err[&quot;txRef&quot;])```&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;## ```rave.Account```This is used to facilitate account transactions.**Functions included:*** ```.charge```* ```.validate```* ```.verify```&lt;br&gt;### ```.charge(payload)```This is called to start an account transaction.

The ```AccountChargeError``` contains some information about your transaction. You can handle this as such:```pytry:     #Your charge callexcept RaveExceptions.AccountChargeError as e:    print(e.err[&quot;errMsg&quot;])    print(e.err[&quot;flwRef&quot;])```A sample ``` e.err ``` contains:```py{'error': True, 'txRef': 'MC-1530897824739', 'flwRef': None, 'errMsg': 'Sorry, that account number is invalid, please check and try again'}```&lt;br&gt;### ```.validate(txRef)```After a successful charge, most times you will be asked to verify with OTP. To check if this is required, check the ```validationRequired``` key in the ```res``` of the charge call.In the case that an ```authUrl``` is returned from your charge call, you may skip the validation step and simply pass your authUrl to the end-user. ```pyauthUrl = res['authUrl']```To validate, you need to pass the ```flwRef``` from the ```res``` of the charge call as well as the OTP.A sample validate call is: ```pyres2 = rave.Account.validate(res[&quot;flwRef&quot;], &quot;12345&quot;)```#### ReturnsThis call returns a dictionary containing the ```txRef```, ```flwRef``` among others if successful.This call raises a ```TransactionValidationError``` if the OTP is not correct or there was a problem processing your request.

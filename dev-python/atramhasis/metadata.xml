This webapplication enablesusers to create SKOS vocabularies consisting of Concepts and Collections. It tries to stay close to the SKOS specification. This makes it suited for differenttypes of vocabularies such as simple pick lists, authority files, flat lists andbasic to relatively complex thesauri. For a full overview of capabilities, pleaseconsult our `documentation &lt;https://atramhasis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features.html&gt;`_. If you want a quick demo of what the system provides for a typical end user, have a look at the `Flanders Heritage Thesaurus &lt;https://thesaurus.onroerenderfgoed.be&gt;`_. This is an implementation of Atramhasis for the `Flanders Heritage Agency &lt;https://www.onroerenderfgoed.be&gt;`_containing several vocabularies regarding cultural heritage, such as `heritagetypes &lt;https://thesaurus.onroerenderfgoed.be/conceptschemes/ERFGOEDTYPES&gt;`_, `styles and cultures &lt;https://thesaurus.onroerenderfgoed.be/conceptschemes/STIJLEN_EN_CULTUREN&gt;`_, `materials &lt;https://thesaurus.onroerenderfgoed.be/conceptschemes/MATERIALEN&gt;`_ and `periods &lt;https://thesaurus.onroerenderfgoed.be/conceptschemes/DATERINGEN&gt;`_.Most of the vocabularies are in Dutch, but the interface is available in both Dutch, English and French.All development is done through `Github &lt;https://github.com/OnroerendErfgoed/atramhasis&gt;`_. If you run into bugs or would like to request a new feature, please open a `Github issue &lt;https://github.com/OnroerendErfgoed/atramhasis/issues&gt;`_. Pleaseprovide some context to your question such as the operating system,Python and Atramhasis versions you are running. If you have specific questionsabout the software or the datasets hosted at`Flanders Heritage Thesaurus &lt;https://thesaurus.onroerenderfgoed.be&gt;`_you would rather not address in a public forum, please mail us atict@onroerenderfgoed.be.Contributions are welcome. This could be improvements to the code, updated documentation or adding a new translation to the User Interface. Please see our `contribution guidelines &lt;https://github.com/OnroerendErfgoed/atramhasis/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md&gt;`_ to find out how we can collaborate.1.3.2 (14-03-2023)------------------- Fix broken CITATION.cff file.

The 0.7.x releases will also be that last to support Python 2. Ifyou haven't upgraded to Python 3 yet, we advise you to do now.**BC break** The major change in this version is no longer initiating the`skosprovider.registry.Registry` on starting the application, but when arequest is created. The previous way of working created problems withSQLAlchemy providers in a webserver using mutiple threads. Please review thedocs athttps://atramhasis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/customisation.html#creating-conceptschemesto see how it works now. For more background, have a look at thepyramid_skosprovider_ docs at https://pyramid-skosprovider.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.0/install.html- All requirements were updated to their latest versions. Python versions were  fixed to 2.7, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8. If you made custom changes, you might have to  edit them. (#508, #519, #513, #566)- Npm has replaced bower as the package manager for frontend packages and the  build process was revised. If you made custom frontend changes, please  check them thoroughly.(#511)- Instantiation of the SKOS registry was changed to work on a per request  basis. (#346, #490, #535)- Fixed a major issue with generating the expanded version of a concept. By  default the assumption was that concepts in a collection were also narrower  concepts of the collection's superordinate concept, but the implementation  for this was incomplete and contained bugs. This has been changed to an  boolean attribute `infer_concept_relations`. When set to true, concepts in a  collection are considerd to be narrower concepts of that collections's  superordinate concept. This is especially important for a provider's  `expand` function and affects what is considered a narrower concept of a  concept that uses `thesaurus arrays` or `node labels`.- The docs were updated and now contain a part detailing what Atramhasis does  with some screenshots. (#495, #583, #440)- Default inclusion of skosprovider_heritagedata was removed because the  service is unstable too often. (#537)- Improve some SEO by adding canonicul URL's, open graph info, Twitter cards  and the ability to generate a sitemap through a script. (#530, #531, #496,  #497)- Clean up importing and exporting of conceptschemes to make it easier. (#452,  #475, #476, #495)- Provide a simple, printable version of a thesaurus tree. (#533, #532)- Add a script to make removing a conceptscheme easier. Be careful as this will  drop all concepts, collections and the conceptscheme itself. (#579)- Lots of minor improvements and bug fixes.0.6.7 (21-06-2019)------------------- Fix corrupt build- Security updates0.6.6 (01-03-2019)------------------- Update Colander and other dependencies. (#464)- Remove old convert_oe script because it depends on an obsolete webservice. (#466)- Fix an issue with circular dependencies in requirements files. (#463)- Change the default GA macro to anonymizeIp and be more GDPR compliant. (#450)0.6.5 (19-12-2018)------------------- Generate a default dump location in development.ini files. (#416)- Update skosprovider_sqlalchemy to solve a problem with the tree cache. (#455)- Update a lot of dependencies.0.6.4 (22-12-2017)------------------0.6.3 was a brown bag release. Sorry!This version is exactly the same as 0.6.3, but properly packaged.0.6.3 (21-12-2017)------------------- This version updates a lot of the requirements to their latest versions. This  might be an issued if you've written lots of code against older pyramid  versions. (#418, #413, #412, #411, #410, #408, #407, #404, #403)- Remove authentication from the demo version since Persona does not work  anymore. (#361)- Fixed the base HTML template and added a DOCTYPE declaration. (#429)- Update the URI's for licenses of the Flemish Government. (#430)- Fixed an issues with sorting on Python 3. (#424)0.6.2 (11-10-2017)------------------- When an LDF server is present, add a link to the HTML document to this server.  (#394)- Wrong expansion of SKOS namespace in LDF server. (#401)0.6.1 (01-09-2017)------------------This release is a minor release, containing improvements regarding the LinkedData Fragments server.- Also add hidden datasets to the LDF server. Only external ones are not added  now. (#390)- Make it possible to set the LDF server protocol when generating the config.  (#391)- When generating an LDF server config, add a composite source as well. (#393)- When generating the dataset information, add hydra controls that link to   the LDF server instance. (#392)0.6.0 (23-08-2017)------------------This release is a major release containing new features.- Added a script to generate nightly dumps. Instead of generating full  downloads on demand, they can now be generated by a cron job (eg. once per  night, week, ...). This makes it possible to download a large conceptscheme at  once. During these dumps, some statistics on every conceptscheme such as the  number of triples in it will be generated as well. This was done to make it  easier to embed a custom Python based LDF server, but currently only serves  the purpose of keeping some score. (#337, #360)- Added easy integration with a Linked Data Fragments server   (https://linkeddatafragments.org). Atramhasis can now  generate a config file for such a server that you can use to setup the server.  By default this config will work with the Turtle files that can be generated  every night. But if you have access to the HDT library, you can also work with  HDT files for a masssive performance boost. See the section `Running a Linked  Data Fragments server` in the docs for more information. (#365)- Add some more information the HTML title tags for a concept detail. (#363)- Changed the UI for doing a search so that you now get a proper warning when  searching for a label without specifying the conceptscheme to search in. (#373)- It is now possible to generate URI's when importing from a file that does not  contain them, eg. a JSON or CSV file. The `import_file` can now take a  `pattern_uri` parameter than will be used to generate new URI's with. (#372)- Fixed some issues with the tree cache that came to light when running  Atramhasis as two nodes. Where before it was not possible to configure the  tree cache, it now is. Previously an in-memory cache would always be used. Now  it's possible to use a different type of cache. If you're running more than  one webserver, it is advised to run a shared cache. If you're running a  previous version of Atramhasis, you will need to configure your cache with   `cache.tree` and `cache.list` settings. (#371)- It is now possible to add sortLabels to concepts. These can be used in the  REST service to arbitrarily sort concepts. The sortLabel works per language.  This makes it possible to eg. sort historical periods in chronological order.  Most of the functionality was already present in `skosprovider` 0.6.0, but it  had not been properly included in Atramhasis.  (#362)- Added 'und - undetermined' to the default language set to support json file   imports. (#386)- Fixed a bug when editing concepts where data from previously opened concepts  would bleed into the concept you were editing. (#367)- Update several dependencies to the latest versions. (#380, #381, #376)- Added 'und - undetermined' to the default language set to support json file imports (#386)0.5.2 (07-10-2016)------------------This minor release fixes a bug with the protected resource event. The event shouldgive the uri of a concept instead of the url path. In addition to the uri the requestis added to the event. It also fixes the bug with removing relations and updates the requirements for skosprovider_sqlalchemy_.0.5.1 (04-10-2016)------------------This minor release fixes a bug with the tree browser. Before it wasn't possibleto zoom and pan the tree. With certain larger trees this would cause issues ascontent would run off the page.0.5.0 (14-09-2016)------------------This release is a major update based on the `skosprovider`_ `0.6.0` lineof libraries. The most visible change is with the public and admin interfaces.These have been completely overhauled to provide a more pleasing userexperience. Among other things visitors are now pointed towards popular conceptsand concepts they have recently visited. Browsing an entire conceptscheme treehas been redesigned.The adming interface now offers users an option to edit certain aspects of aconceptscheme such as the labels, notes and sources. Editing in general has beenupdate and improved. Links between the public interface and the admin interfacehave been added to make switching from one to the other easier. Notes andsources can now contain certain HTML tags, allowing greater flexibility indefining concepts and collections.A command line script was added to make it easy to import an entireconceptscheme, eg. when migrating from another system. It is now possible toimport a RDF, CSV or JSON file on the command line in your Atramhasis instance.With earlier versions you had to script this yourself.As always, bugs have been fixed, code has been rewritten and documenation hasbeen updated.See https://github.com/OnroerendErfgoed/atramhasis/milestone/8?closed=1 for thefull list of changes.0.4.4 (04-06-2015)------------------- Added more sample datasets to get a better view of real data. These will make  the demo more interesting.- Fix a bug where it was possible to create a relation between a concept and  itself causing all sorts of nasty things to happen.- Minor refactoring. Move the pyramid routes to a new file.- Added a CONTRIBUTING.md file. Contributions welcome!0.4.3 (11-03-2015)------------------We had some packaging issues with the `0.4.2` release.0.4.2 (11-03-2015)------------------This release of Atramhasis is mostly a bugfix update of the `0.4.1` release.- Fix paths of db in scaffolds- Add more information on exceptions- Update skosprovider_getty and skosprovider_heritagedata  (fix the problems when importing external thesauri)- Documentation update0.4.1 (04-03-2015)------------------This release of Atramhasis is a minor update of the `0.4.0` release, focussingon small corrections and improvements and improving the documentation. A fewinteresting non-invasive features were added, mostly to the editor's admininterface and machine-readable exports of RDF data.Upgrading from `0.4.0` should be simple and cause no or few problems.- A conceptscheme, concept or collection can now be exported to RDF through  skosprovider_rdf_ 0.3.1. These are individuals export endpoints that can  be reached in one of two ways. Either by hitting a url like  http://localhost:6543/conceptschemes/GEOGRAPHY/c/335 with a supported RDF mimetype  (``application/rdf+xml``, ``application/x-turtle``, ``text-turle``). Or by  using an RDF syntax specific suffix (.rdf or .ttl).- When importing, allow the user to request more information on a concept or  collection, before actually importing it.- Allow merging a concept with other concepts it matches. This allows a user to  compare a local concept with an external one it matches and import any notes  or labels that are present in the external concept, but not the local one.- Reworked some parts of the public interface to make everything a bit clearer  and to make all pages easily reachable.- Allow sorting the languages in the admin interface.- Reorganised and extended the right click menu on the grid in the admin  interface.- Allow looking up a *skos:match* from within the admin interface.- Some issues with the length of language ids were solved.- Fixed some issues when importing a collection instead of a concept.- Made it easy to add a Google Analytics tracker.- Added instructions on how to deploy a demo site on heroku_. These work just as  well for deploying an actual production site to heroku_.- Lots of small updates and tweaks to the documentation.- Updated some dependencies.- Some code cleanup and reorganisation. Several smaller bugs in the admin  interface were fixed.- The data fixtures were updated with *skos:note* examples. Added a license for  reuse of the fixture data.0.4.0 (23-12-2014)------------------- Update to skosprovider_ 0.5.0. Among other things, this makes it possible  to handle relations between Concepts and Collections using the  *subordinate_arrays* and *superordinates* properties. Conceptschemes are  now also much better integrated within the providers, thus making it  possible to provider more context for a Concept. This version of  skosprovider_ can also handle *skos:matches*.- Add possibility to edit language tags. It's now possible to use the admin  interface to add, edit and delete languages in Atramhasis.- When the REST service receives labels or notes in currently unavailable  languages, it will validate those through language_tags_. It the languages  are valid according to the IANA registry, they will be added to the languages  available in the application.- Default length of language id changed to 64 characters. This is not available  as an alembic migration. So only effective when creating a new database.  If you already have a database created from an older version of Atramhasis,  please modify accordingly. Modifying column length on SQLite is not possible  (see http://www.sqlite.org/omitted.html ).- Abiltity to match Concepts in an Atramhasis ConceptScheme to Concepts in  external ConceptSchemes through properties such as *skos:exactMatch* and  *skos:closeMatch*.- Ability to import Concepts and Collections from external providers. This  makes it possible to import Concepts from eg. the AAT (via skosprovider_getty_),  Flanders Heritage Thesauri (via skosprovider_oe_),  English Heritage Thesauri (via skosprovider_heritagedata_) or any other  SKOS vocabulary for which a skosprovider_ has been written. Currently only  the concept or collection itself can be imported, without its relations to  other concepts or collections.- Add the ability to have a delete of a concept or collection fail if it is  being used in other systems.- Implement a delete permission.- Add validation rule that a Concept must have at least one label.- Update to skosprovider_sqlalchemy_ 0.4.1.- Update to pyramid_skosprovider_ 0.5.0.- Update to skosprovider_rdf_ 0.3.0. This update adds support for dumping  ConceptScheme in an RDF file and also handles *subordinate_arrays* and  *superordinates*.- Update to language_tags_ 0.3.0.0.3.1 (05-09-2014)------------------- Update to skosprovider_sqlalchemy_ 0.2.1.- Update to skosprovider_rdf_ 0.1.3 This fixes an issue with RDF having some  SKOS elements in the wrong namespace. Also added a missing dependency on  skosprovider_rdf_ to setup.py- Updated the Travis build file to run a basic dojo build and test for build  failures.0.3.0 (15-08-2014)------------------- Atramhasis now includes a working admin userinterface at `/admin`. Still needs  some polish when it comes to error handling and reporting about validation  errors.- The admin module gets run through a dojo build to minimize page loads  and download times- Added RDF/XML en RDF/Turtle downloads to the public interface. Currently  only dumps a full conceptscheme, not individual concepts.- Added more docs.0.2.0 (16-05-2014)------------------- Full public userinterface- REST CRUD service- Security integration- CSV export- demo using Mozilla Persona as sample security setup0.1.0 (22-04-2014)------------------- Initial version- Setup of the project: docs, unit testing, code coverage- Scaffolding for demo and deployment packages- Limited public user interface- Basis i18n abilities present- Integration of pyramid_skosprovider_- Integration of skosprovider_- Integration of skosprovider_sqlalchemy_.. _skosprovider: http://skosprovider.readthedocs.org.. _skosprovider_sqlalchemy: http://skosprovider-sqlalchemy.readthedocs.org.. _skosprovider_rdf: http://skosprovider-rdf.readthedocs.org.. _skosprovider_getty: http://skosprovider-getty.readthedocs.org.. _skosprovider_oe: https://github.com/koenedaele/skosprovider_oe.. _skosprovider_heritagedata: http://skosprovider-heritagedata.readthedocs.org.. _pyramid_skosprovider: http://pyramid-skosprovider.readthedocs.org.. _language_tags: http://language-tags.readthedocs.org.. _heroku: https://www.heroku.com</longdescription>

	<longdescription># ProjectV2 ClientThis is an in-progress client to use the ProjectV2 functionality through the GitHub GraphQL API.## Setup1. Install the `projectv2` module: `pip3 install github-projectv2`2. Create a `.env` file in the root containing a value for `GITHUB_API_TOKEN` (this will be loaded using `python-dotenv`)3. Use the `requirements.txt` file to ensure you have all of the dependencies you need.4. Enjoy!**NOTE:** You can use an actual environment variable instead of the `.env` approach, setting the same `GITHUB_API_TOKEN` value## Example Usage```pythonfrom projectv2.project import Projectproject = Project()project.get('myorg', '1234')print(project.title)# Find the field with the name &quot;Test Field 1&quot;found = Nonefor field in project.fields:    if field.name == &quot;Test Field 1&quot;:        found = fieldif found is None:    raise Exception(&quot;Field not found&quot;)items = project.get_items('myorg')print(items)# Look on the project fields and find the one with the name &quot;Test Field 1&quot; and get its options# Then, find the option with the name &quot;Option 1&quot; and get its idfor option in found.options:    if option.name == &quot;test3&quot;:        newOption = optionfor item in items:    result = item.update_field_value(project, field, newOption)    print(result)```## Modules### ProjectThe `Project` module is used to get the information about a project. It results in an instance with the following properties:- `title` (string)- `description` (string)- `id` (string): internal ID of project record- `number` (integer): public-facing ID number of project- `fields` (list): Set of fields in the project, default and custom- `items` (list): Set of &quot;items&quot; in the project, usually issue instances- `org` (string): Name of the organization the project belongs to- `createdAt` (datetime): Date/time of project creation- `closedAt` (datetime): Date/time when project was closed- `closed` (boolean): The open/closed state of the project- `shortDescription` (string): Short description of the project- `public` (boolean): Visibility for the project (public=`True`, private=`False`)- `readme` (string): Full readme for the project- `url` (string): Full public-facing URL location of the project**NOTE:** When the `get` method is called on the `Project`, the `get_fields` method will automatically be called to populate the `fields` property with instances of the `Field` class.#### Methods`get(org, projectNumber)`: Get a project by organization name and public-facing project numberWhere:- `org` (string): the name of the organization- `projectNumber` (string): the public-facing ID for the project`get_fields(org)`: Get the fields for a project given the organization name and public-facing project numberWhere:- `org` is the name of the organization (optional)`get_items(org)`: Get the items currently in the project (issues)Where:- `org` is the name of the organizationReturns:- A set of `Item` object types`get_views(org)`: Get the current list of views for the projectWhere:- `org` (string): optional name of the organizationReturns:- A set of `View` object types`create(data)`: Create a new projectWhere:- `data` (list): Data to use in the creation of the project (required values: `title`, `ownerId`)Returns:- A `Project` instance with the new data set`remove_item(item)`: Removes an item from a projectWhere:- `item` must be a record as fetched by `get_items`, not from a call to `Item.get`Returns:- The internal ID of the deleted item`add_item(item)`: Adds an item/issue to a projectWhere:- `item` is a record as fetched by `Item.get` or from the list from `Project.get_items`Returns:- The internal ID of the item that was added`save()`: Saves the current state of the project record (fields saved are title, shortDescription, readme, closed)Returns:- The current instance, a `Project` with the updated information**NOTE:** the `get_fields` and `get_items` require that the project is fetched using `get` first and will throw an error otherwise.### ItemThe `Item` module is used to represent an item in a project (an issue record).

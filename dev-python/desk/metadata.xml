	<longdescription>======================Dusty-Evolved-Star-Kit======================The DESK is an SED-fitting python package for fitting data from evolved stars(photometry or spectra) with radiative transfer model grids. The packageis currently in development and all contributions are welcomed. For currentprogress, see the 'Issues' tab on the Github_ page. The package is ideal forfitting small samples of dusty evolved stars. It will soon utilize abayesian-fitting strategy with mass-loss rate and luminosity distributions asinputs (priors), and will provide a better fit to these broader sampleproperties.**Input**: A csv file with the first column as wavelength in um and second columnas flux in Jy. To fit multiple csv files, put them in a directory, and use thedirectory name as the input.**Output**: A csv file including the best fit model and correspondingstellar parameters, as well as an optional figure of the fit SED.Available model grids: Several grids are already available upon installation. A range ofother model grids, including state-of-the-art dust-growth models by `Nanni et al. (2019)`_, are downloaded automatically and used when selected. Descriptions of the modelgrids can be found in the Documentation_. A module for creating your own DUSTY_ gridis under development, but for now, please email me (`Dr. Steven Goldman`_) directlyfor potential grid requests or for help with the package.* Free software: BSD license* Documentation: https://dusty-evolved-star-kit.readthedocs.io.* TODO**Credits**: This package was created with Cookiecutter_ and the `audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`_ project template... _Github: https://github.com/s-goldman/Dusty-Evolved-Star-Kit.. _Cookiecutter: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter.. _`audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage.. _DUSTY : https://github.com/ivezic/dusty.. _Documentation : https://dusty-evolved-star-kit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/grids.html.. _Nanni et al.

The sed andsed_indivscripts now use a common set of functions to minimize duplicated code,and ensure consistency. 1.7.1 (2020-08-05)Minor bug fixes to the data retrieval script.1.7.0 (2020-07-24)First major release of least-squares fitting DESK. The package is stable withpytest testing through Github-actions (Ubuntu and OSX: Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8),documentation with Sphinx on readthedocs, coverage with codecov,code quality checks with codacy, installation with pip, and hosted on Github.Model grids are downloaded using direct-download links on Box.1.3.1 (2019-04-29)------------------* First release on PyPI.</longdescription>

	<longdescription>BigML Python Bindings=====================`BigML &lt;https://bigml.com&gt;`_ makes machine learning easy by taking careof the details required to add data-driven decisions and predictivepower to your company. Unlike other machine learning services, BigMLcreates`beautiful predictive models &lt;https://bigml.com/gallery/models&gt;`_ thatcan be easily understood and interacted with.These BigML Python bindings allow you to interact with`BigML.io &lt;https://bigml.io/&gt;`_, the APIfor BigML. You can use it to easily create, retrieve, list, update, anddelete BigML resources (i.e., sources, datasets, models and,predictions). For additional information, seethe `full documentation for the Pythonbindings on Read the Docs &lt;http://bigml.readthedocs.org&gt;`_.This module is licensed under the `Apache License, Version2.0 &lt;http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html&gt;`_.Support-------Please report problems and bugs to our `BigML.io issuetracker &lt;https://github.com/bigmlcom/io/issues&gt;`_.Discussions about the different bindings take place in the general`BigML mailing list &lt;http://groups.google.com/group/bigml&gt;`_. Or join usin our `Campfire chatroom &lt;https://bigmlinc.campfirenow.com/f20a0&gt;`_.Requirements------------Only ``Python 3`` versions are currently supported by these bindings.Support for Python 2.7.X ended in version ``4.32.3``.The basic third-party dependencies are the`requests &lt;https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests&gt;`_,`unidecode &lt;http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Unidecode/#downloads&gt;`_,`requests-toolbelt &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests-toolbelt&gt;`_,`bigml-chronos &lt;https://pypi.org/project/bigml-chronos&gt;`_,`msgpack &lt;https://pypi.org/project/msgpack&gt;`_,`numpy &lt;http://www.numpy.org/&gt;`_ and`scipy &lt;http://www.scipy.org/&gt;`_ libraries. Theselibraries are automatically installed during the basic setup.Support for Google App Engine has been added as of version 3.0.0,using the `urlfetch` package instead of `requests`.The bindings will also use ``simplejson`` if you happen to have itinstalled, but that is optional: we fall back to Python's built-in JSONlibraries is ``simplejson`` is not found.The bindings provide support to use the ``BigML`` platform to create, update,get and delete resources, but also to produce local predictions using themodels created in ``BigML``. Most of them will be actionable with the basicinstallation, but some additional dependencies are needed to use local``Topic Models`` and Image Processing models. Please, refer to the`Installation &lt;#installation&gt;`_ section for details.OS Requirements~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The basic installation of the bindings is compatible and can be usedon Linux and Windows based Operating Systems.However, the extra options that allow working withimage processing models (``[images]`` and ``[full]``) are only supportedand tested on Linux-based Operating Systems.For image models, Windows OS is not recommended and cannot be supported out ofthe box, because the specific compiler versions or dlls required areunavailable in general.Installation------------To install the basic latest stable release with`pip &lt;http://www.pip-installer.org/&gt;`_, please use:.. code-block:: bash    $ pip install bigmlSupport for local Topic Distributions (Topic Models' predictions)and local predictions for datasets that include Images will only beavailable as extras, because the libraries used for that are notusually available in all Operative Systems. If you need to support those,please check the `Installation Extras &lt;#installation-extras&gt;`_ section.Installation Extras-------------------Local Topic Distributions support can be installed using:.. code-block:: bash    pip install bigml[topics]Images local predictions support can be installed using:.. code-block:: bash    pip install bigml[images]The full set of features can be installed using:.. code-block:: bash    pip install bigml[full]WARNING: Mind that installing these extras can require some extra work, asexplained in the `Requirements &lt;#requirements&gt;`_ section.You can also install the development version of the bindings directlyfrom the Git repository.. code-block:: bash    $ pip install -e git://github.com/bigmlcom/python.git#egg=bigml_pythonRunning the Tests-----------------The tests will be run using `pytest &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/&gt;`_.You'll need to set up your authenticationvia environment variables, as explainedin the authentication section. Also some of the tests need other environmentvariables like ``BIGML_ORGANIZATION`` to test calls when used by Organizationmembers and ``BIGML_EXTERNAL_CONN_HOST``, ``BIGML_EXTERNAL_CONN_PORT``,``BIGML_EXTERNAL_CONN_DB``, ``BIGML_EXTERNAL_CONN_USER``,``BIGML_EXTERNAL_CONN_PWD`` and ``BIGML_EXTERNAL_CONN_SOURCE``in order to test external data connectors.With that in place, you can run the test suite simply by issuing.. code-block:: bash    $ pytestAdditionally, `Tox &lt;http://tox.testrun.org/&gt;`_ can be used toautomatically run the test suite in virtual environments for allsupported Python versions.  To install Tox:.. code-block:: bash    $ pip install toxThen run the tests from the top-level project directory:.. code-block:: bash    $ toxImporting the module--------------------To import the module:.. code-block:: python    import bigml.apiAlternatively you can just import the BigML class:.. code-block:: python    from bigml.api import BigMLAuthentication--------------All the requests to BigML.io must be authenticated using your usernameand `API key &lt;https://bigml.com/account/apikey&gt;`_ and are alwaystransmitted over HTTPS.This module will look for your username and API key in the environmentvariables ``BIGML_USERNAME`` and ``BIGML_API_KEY`` respectively.Unix and MacOS--------------You canadd the following lines to your ``.bashrc`` or ``.bash_profile`` to setthose variables automatically when you log in:.. code-block:: bash    export BIGML_USERNAME=myusername    export BIGML_API_KEY=ae579e7e53fb9abd646a6ff8aa99d4afe83ac291refer to the next chapters to know how to do that in other operating systems.With that environment set up, connecting to BigML is a breeze:.. code-block:: python    from bigml.api import BigML    api = BigML()Otherwise, you can initialize directly when instantiating the BigMLclass as follows:.. code-block:: python    api = BigML('myusername', 'ae579e7e53fb9abd646a6ff8aa99d4afe83ac291')These credentials will allow you to manage any resource in your userenvironment.In BigML a user can also work for an ``organization``.In this case, the organization administrator should previously assignpermissions for the user to access one or several particular projectsin the organization.Once permissions are granted, the user can work with resources in a projectaccording to his permission level by creating a special constructor foreach project. The connection constructor in this caseshould include the ``project ID``:.. code-block:: python    api = BigML('myusername', 'ae579e7e53fb9abd646a6ff8aa99d4afe83ac291',                project='project/53739b98d994972da7001d4a')If the project used in a connection objectdoes not belong to an existing organization but is one of theprojects under the user's account, all the resourcescreated or updated with that connection will also be assigned to thespecified project.When the resource to be managed is a ``project`` itself, the connectionneeds to include the corresponding``organization ID``:.. code-block:: python    api = BigML('myusername', 'ae579e7e53fb9abd646a6ff8aa99d4afe83ac291',                organization='organization/53739b98d994972da7025d4a')Authentication on Windows-------------------------The credentials should be permanently stored in your system using.. code-block:: bash    setx BIGML_USERNAME myusername    setx BIGML_API_KEY ae579e7e53fb9abd646a6ff8aa99d4afe83ac291Note that ``setx`` will not change the environment variables of your actualconsole, so you will need to open a new one to start using them.Authentication on Jupyter Notebook----------------------------------You can set the environment variables using the ``%env`` command in yourcells:.. code-block:: bash    %env BIGML_USERNAME=myusername    %env BIGML_API_KEY=ae579e7e53fb9abd646a6ff8aa99d4afe83ac291Alternative domains-------------------The main public domain for the API service is ``bigml.io``, but there are somealternative domains, either for Virtual Private Cloud setups orthe australian subdomain (``au.bigml.io``). You can change the remoteserver domainto the VPC particular one by either setting the ``BIGML_DOMAIN`` environmentvariable to your VPC subdomain:.. code-block:: bash    export BIGML_DOMAIN=my_VPC.bigml.ioor setting it when instantiating your connection:.. code-block:: python    api = BigML(domain=&quot;my_VPC.bigml.io&quot;)The corresponding SSL REST calls will be directed to your private domainhenceforth.You can also set up your connection to use a particular PredictServeronly for predictions. In order to do so, you'll need to specify a ``Domain``object, where you can set up the general domain name as well as theparticular prediction domain name... code-block:: python    from bigml.domain import Domain    from bigml.api import BigML    domain_info = Domain(prediction_domain=&quot;my_prediction_server.bigml.com&quot;,                         prediction_protocol=&quot;http&quot;)    api = BigML(domain=domain_info)Finally, you can combine all the options and change both the general domainserver, and the prediction domain server... code-block:: python    from bigml.domain import Domain    from bigml.api import BigML    domain_info = Domain(domain=&quot;my_VPC.bigml.io&quot;,                         prediction_domain=&quot;my_prediction_server.bigml.com&quot;,                         prediction_protocol=&quot;https&quot;)    api = BigML(domain=domain_info)Some arguments for the Domain constructor are more unsual, but they can alsobe used to set your special service endpoints:- protocol (string) Protocol for the service  (when different from HTTPS)- verify (boolean) Sets on/off the SSL verification- prediction_verify (boolean) Sets on/off the SSL verification  for the prediction server (when different from the general  SSL verification)**Note** that the previously existing ``dev_mode`` flag:.. code-block:: python    api = BigML(dev_mode=True)that caused the connection to work with the Sandbox ``Development Environment``has been **deprecated** because this environment does not longer exist.The existing resources that were previouslycreated in this environment have been movedto a special project in the now unique ``Production Environment``, so thisflag is no longer needed to work with them.Quick Start-----------Imagine that you want to use `this csvfile &lt;https://static.bigml.com/csv/iris.csv&gt;`_ containing the `Irisflower dataset &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set&gt;`_ topredict the species of a flower whose ``petal length`` is ``2.45`` andwhose ``petal width`` is ``1.75``. A preview of the dataset is shownbelow. It has 4 numeric fields: ``sepal length``, ``sepal width``,``petal length``, ``petal width`` and a categorical field: ``species``.By default, BigML considers the last field in the dataset as theobjective field (i.e., the field that you want to generate predictionsfor).::    sepal length,sepal width,petal length,petal width,species    5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa    4.9,3.0,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa    4.7,3.2,1.3,0.2,Iris-setosa    ...    5.8,2.7,3.9,1.2,Iris-versicolor    6.0,2.7,5.1,1.6,Iris-versicolor    5.4,3.0,4.5,1.5,Iris-versicolor    ...    6.8,3.0,5.5,2.1,Iris-virginica    5.7,2.5,5.0,2.0,Iris-virginica    5.8,2.8,5.1,2.4,Iris-virginicaYou can easily generate a prediction following these steps:.. code-block:: python    from bigml.api import BigML    api = BigML()    source = api.create_source('./data/iris.csv')    dataset = api.create_dataset(source)    model = api.create_model(dataset)    prediction = api.create_prediction(model, \        {&quot;petal width&quot;: 1.75, &quot;petal length&quot;: 2.45})You can then print the prediction using the ``pprint`` method:.. code-block:: python    &gt;&gt;&gt; api.pprint(prediction)    species for {&quot;petal width&quot;: 1.75, &quot;petal length&quot;: 2.45} is Iris-setosaCertainly, any of the resources created in BigML can be configured usingseveral arguments described in the `API documentation &lt;https://bigml.com/api&gt;`_.Any of these configuration arguments can be added to the ``create`` methodas a dictionary in the last optional argument of the calls:.. code-block:: python    from bigml.api import BigML    api = BigML()    source_args = {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;my source&quot;,         &quot;source_parser&quot;: {&quot;missing_tokens&quot;: [&quot;NULL&quot;]}}    source = api.create_source('./data/iris.csv', source_args)    dataset_args = {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;my dataset&quot;}    dataset = api.create_dataset(source, dataset_args)    model_args = {&quot;objective_field&quot;: &quot;species&quot;}    model = api.create_model(dataset, model_args)    prediction_args = {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;my prediction&quot;}    prediction = api.create_prediction(model, \        {&quot;petal width&quot;: 1.75, &quot;petal length&quot;: 2.45},        prediction_args)The ``iris`` dataset has a small number of instances, and usually will beinstantly created, so the ``api.create_`` calls will probably return thefinished resources outright. As BigML's API is asynchronous,in general you will need to ensurethat objects are finished before using them by using ``api.ok``... code-block:: python    from bigml.api import BigML    api = BigML()    source = api.create_source('./data/iris.csv')    api.ok(source)    dataset = api.create_dataset(source)    api.ok(dataset)    model = api.create_model(dataset)    api.ok(model)    prediction = api.create_prediction(model, \        {&quot;petal width&quot;: 1.75, &quot;petal length&quot;: 2.45})Note that the predictioncall is not followed by the ``api.ok`` method. Predictions are so quick to begenerated that, unlike therest of resouces, will be generated synchronously as a finished object.The example assumes that your objective field (the one you want to predict)is the last field in the dataset. If that's not he case, you can explicitlyset the name of this field in the creation call using the ``objective_field``argument:.. code-block:: python    from bigml.api import BigML    api = BigML()    source = api.create_source('./data/iris.csv')    api.ok(source)    dataset = api.create_dataset(source)    api.ok(dataset)    model = api.create_model(dataset, {&quot;objective_field&quot;: &quot;species&quot;})    api.ok(model)    prediction = api.create_prediction(model, \        {'sepal length': 5, 'sepal width': 2.5})You can also generate an evaluation for the model by using:.. code-block:: python    test_source = api.create_source('./data/test_iris.csv')    api.ok(test_source)    test_dataset = api.create_dataset(test_source)    api.ok(test_dataset)    evaluation = api.create_evaluation(model, test_dataset)    api.ok(evaluation)If you set the ``storage`` argument in the ``api`` instantiation:.. code-block:: python    api = BigML(storage='./storage')all the generated, updated or retrieved resources will be automaticallysaved to the chosen directory.Alternatively, you can use the ``export`` method to explicitlydownload the JSON informationthat describes any of your resources in BigML to a particular file:.. code-block:: python    api.export('model/5acea49a08b07e14b9001068',               filename=&quot;my_dir/my_model.json&quot;)This example downloads the JSON for the model and stores it inthe ``my_dir/my_model.json`` file.In the case of models that can be represented in a `PMML` syntax, theexport method can be used to produce the corresponding `PMML` file... code-block:: python    api.export('model/5acea49a08b07e14b9001068',               filename=&quot;my_dir/my_model.pmml&quot;,               pmml=True)You can also retrieve the last resource with some previously given tag:.. code-block:: python     api.export_last(&quot;foo&quot;,                     resource_type=&quot;ensemble&quot;,                     filename=&quot;my_dir/my_ensemble.json&quot;)which selects the last ensemble that has a ``foo`` tag. This mechanism canbe specially useful when retrieving retrained models that have been createdwith a shared unique keyword as tag.For a descriptive overview of the steps that you will usually need tofollow to modelyour data and obtain predictions, please see the `basic Workflow sketch&lt;api_sketch.html&gt;`_document.

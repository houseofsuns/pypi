	<longdescription># Legion UtilsUtilities for Legion Reporters and Monitors## UsageTODO## Installation &amp; SetupTo install legion-utils with [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) execute the following:```bashpip install /path/to/repo/legion-utils```If you don't want to re-install every time there is an update, and prefer to just pull from the git repository, then use the `-e` flag.## Development### Standards- Be excellent to each other- Code coverage must be at 100% for all new code, or a good reason must be provided for why a given bit of code is not covered.  - Example of an acceptable reason: &quot;There is a bug in the code coverage tool and it says its missing this, but its not&quot;.  - Example of unacceptable reason: &quot;This is just exception handling, its too annoying to cover it&quot;.- The code must pass the following analytics tools. Similar exceptions are allowable as in rule 2.  - `pylint --disable=C0111,W1203,R0903 --max-line-length=100 ...`  - `flake8 --max-line-length=100 ...`  - `mypy --ignore-missing-imports --follow-imports=skip --strict-optional ...`- All incoming information from users, clients, and configurations should be validated.- All internal arguments passing should be typechecked whenever possible with `typeguard.typechecked`### Development SetupUsing [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) install from inside the repo directory:```bashpoetry install```This will set up a virtualenv which you can always activate with either `poetry shell` or run specific commands with `poetry run`. All instructions below that are meant to be run in the virtualenv will be prefaced with `(legion-utils)$ `#### IDE Setup**Sublime Text 3**```bashcurl -sSL https://gitlab.com/-/snippets/2066312/raw/master/poetry.sublime-project.py | poetry run python```## TestingAll testing should be done with `pytest` which is installed with the `dev` requirements.To run all the unit tests, execute the following from the repo directory:```bash(legion-utils)$ pytest```This should produce a coverage report in `/path/to/dewey-api/htmlcov/`While developing, you can use [`watchexec`](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec) to monitor the file system for changes and re-run the tests:```bash(legion-utils)$ watchexec -r -e py,yaml pytest```To run a specific test file:```bashpytest tests/unit/test_core.py```To run a specific test:```bashpytest tests/unit/test_core.py::test_hello```For more information on testing, see the `pytest.ini` file as well as the [documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/).</longdescription>

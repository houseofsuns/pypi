	<longdescription># mrio_common_metadata`mrio_common_metadata` provides three things:* A guide on how the [Data Package](https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/data-package/) and [Table Schema](https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/table-schema/) specifications can be used to make MRIO table more consistently formatted and easier to use.* Translations of some common MRIO tables to this format* Utility code to help make the previous two objectives possible# Separating data and metadataMRIO tables are often given with weird offsets, and multiple or mixed column/row labels, e.g.![Worksheet with column labels as rows](docs/images/worksheet-1.png)![Worksheet with multiple column and row labels](docs/images/worksheet-2.png)Working with this type of data requires writing custom code each time. It's a pain. The biggest problem is the mixing of two data types: The metdata on what each row and column represent, and the numerical table that forms the main body of the worksheet. `mrio_common_metadata` takes the position that these two data streams should be stored separately. It also requires that data be stored in common formats (compressed CSV) with metadata that meets the `Data Package` specification.</longdescription>

	<longdescription>pygatt - Python Module for Bluetooth LE Generic Attribute Profile (GATT).=========================================================================This Module allows reading and writing to GATT descriptors on devicessuch as fitness trackers, sensors, and anything implementing standardGATT Descriptor behavior.pygatt provides a Pythonic API by wrapping two different backends:-  BlueZ (requires Linux), using the ``gatttool`` command-line utility.-  Bluegiga's BGAPI, compatible with USB adapters like the BLED112.Motivation----------Despite the popularity of BLE, we have yet to find a good programminginterface for it on desktop computers. Since most peripherals aredesigned to work with smartphones, this space is neglected. Oneinteractive interface, BlueZ's ``gatttool``, is functional but difficultto use programmatically. BlueZ itself obviously works, but the interfaceleaves something to be desired and only works in Linux.Requirements-------------  Python 2.7.5 or greater, or Python 3.5 or greater   -  Python 2.7.3's ``struct`` library has a bug that will break PyGATT - 2.7.5         or greater is recommended.-  BlueZ 5.18 or greater (with gatttool) - required for the gatttool   backend only.   -  Tested on 5.18, 5.21, 5.35 and 5.43-  GATTToolBackend requires Linux (i.e. not Windows compatible)Installation------------Install ``pygatt`` with pip from PyPI:::    $ pip install pygattThe BlueZ backend is not supported by default as it requires``pexpect``, which can only be installed in a UNIX-based environment. Ifyou wish to use that backend, install the optional dependencies with:::    $ pip install &quot;pygatt[GATTTOOL]&quot;Install the latest development version of ``pygatt`` with pip:::    $ pip install git+https://github.com/peplin/pygattDocumentation-------------The documentation for pygatt consists of:- This README- The code in the ``samples`` directory- The Python docstrings in the code itself.The ``BLEDevice`` and ``BLEBackend`` base classes are the primary interfaces forusers of the library.Example Use-----------The primary API for users of this library is provided by``pygatt.BLEBackend`` and ``pygatt.BLEDevice``. After initializing aninstance of the preferred backend (available implementations are foundin ``pygatt.backends``, use the ``BLEBackend.connect`` method to connectto a device and get an instance of ``BLEDevice.``.. code:: python    import pygatt    # The BGAPI backend will attempt to auto-discover the serial device name of the    # attached BGAPI-compatible USB adapter.    adapter = pygatt.BGAPIBackend()    try:        adapter.start()        device = adapter.connect('01:23:45:67:89:ab')        value = device.char_read(&quot;a1e8f5b1-696b-4e4c-87c6-69dfe0b0093b&quot;)    finally:        adapter.stop()Note that not all backends support connecting to more than 1 device atat time, so calling ``BLEBackend.connect`` again may terminate existingconnections.Here's the same example using the GATTTool backend. It's identicalexcept for the initialization of the backend:.. code:: python    import pygatt    adapter = pygatt.GATTToolBackend()    try:        adapter.start()        device = adapter.connect('01:23:45:67:89:ab')        value = device.char_read(&quot;a1e8f5b1-696b-4e4c-87c6-69dfe0b0093b&quot;)    finally:        adapter.stop()Notifications Example---------------------This example uses the gatttool backend to connect to a device with a specificMAC address, subscribes for notifications on a characteristic, and prints thedata returned in each notification... code:: python    import pygatt    from binascii import hexlify    adapter = pygatt.GATTToolBackend()    def handle_data(handle, value):        &quot;&quot;&quot;        handle -- integer, characteristic read handle the data was received on        value -- bytearray, the data returned in the notification        &quot;&quot;&quot;        print(&quot;Received data: %s&quot; % hexlify(value))    try:        adapter.start()        device = adapter.connect('01:23:45:67:89:ab')        device.subscribe(&quot;a1e8f5b1-696b-4e4c-87c6-69dfe0b0093b&quot;,                         callback=handle_data)    finally:        adapter.stop()Debugging---------While debugging software using pygatt, it is often useful to see what'shappening inside the library. You can enable debugging logging and haveit printed to your terminal with this code:::    import pygatt    import logging    logging.basicConfig()    logging.getLogger('pygatt').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)Can't find BGAPI device in Windows~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~You may need to explicitly specify the COM port of your BGAPI-compatibledevice in windows, e.g.:::    adapter = pygatt.BGAPIBackend(serial_port='COM9')If you provide the COM port name, but still get an error such as``WindowsError(2, 'The system cannot find the file specified.')``, trychanging the COM port of the device to a value under 10, e.g. ``COM9``.Authors-------- Jeff Rowberg @jrowberg https://github.com/jrowberg/bglib- Greg Albrecht @ampledata https://github.com/ampledata/pygatt- Christopher Peplin @peplin https://github.com/peplin/pygatt- Morten Kjaergaard @mkjaergaard https://github.com/mkjaergaard/pygatt- Michael Saunby @msaunby https://github.com/msaunby/ble-sensor-pi- Steven Sloboda https://github.com/sloboste- Ilya Sukhanov @IlyaSukhanov- @dcliftreaves- Jonathan Dan- Ilann Adjedj- Ralph Hempel- Rene Jacobsen- Marcus Georgi- Alexandre Barachant- Michel Rivas Hernandez- Jean Regisser- David Martin- Pieter Hooimeijer- Thomas Li Fredriksen- Markus Proeller- lachtanek- Andrea Merello- Richard Mitchell- Daniel Santos- Andrew Connell- Jakub Hrabec- John Schoenberger- Georgi Boiko- Jose PhillipsReleasing to PyPI-----------------For the maintainers of the project, when you want to make a release:-  Merge all of the changes into ``master``.-  Update the version in ``setup.py``.-  Update the ``CHANGELOG.mkd``-  Tag the commit and push to GitHub (will need to push to a separate   branch of PR first since ``master`` is a protected branch).-  Travis CI will take care of the rest - it will build and deploy   tagged commits to PyPI automatically.License-------Copyright 2015 Stratos Inc. and Orion LabsApache License, Version 2.0 and MIT License.

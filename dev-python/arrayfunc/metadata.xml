These attributes are part of the &quot;arraylimits&quot; module.---------------------------------------------------------------------Supported Array Types=====================Arrayfunc supports all standard Python 3.x array types.---------------------------------------------------------------------Performance===========Average performance increase on x86_64 Ubuntu with GCC is 100 times faster than native Python. Performance will vary depending on the function, operation, array data type used, and whether overflow checking is enabled, with the performance increase ranging from 50% to 3000 times. Other platforms show similar improvements.Detailed performance figures are listed in the full documentation.---------------------------------------------------------------------Platform support================Arrayfunc is written in 'C' and uses the standard C libraries to implement the underlying math functions. Arrayfunc has been tested on the following platforms.======================= ========== ====== =============== ================OS                       Hardware   Bits   Compiler        Python Version======================= ========== ====== =============== ================Debian 11                i686         32     GCC               3.9.2Debian 11                x86_64       64     GCC               3.9.2Ubuntu 22.04             x86_64       64     GCC               3.10.6Ubuntu 23.04             x86_64       64     GCC               3.11.2opensuse-leap 15.4       x86_64       64     GCC               3.6.15almalinux 9.1            x86_64       64     GCC               3.9.14alpine 3.17.3            i686         32     GCC               3.10.11FreeBSD 13.2             amd64        64     Clang             3.9.16OpenBSD 7.3              amd64        64     Clang             3.10.10MS Windows 10            AMD64        64     MSC               3.11.0MS Windows 11            AMD64        64     MSC               3.11.0Raspbian 11              armv7l       32     GCC               3.9.2Ubuntu 22.04             aarch64      64     GCC               3.10.6======================= ========== ====== =============== ================amd64 is another name for x86_64 and does not indicate the CPU brand.armv7l is 32 bit ARM. The test hardware is a Raspberry Pi 3.aarch64 is 64 bit ARM. The test hardware is a Raspberry Pi 4.* The Rasberry Pi 3 tests were conducted on a Raspberry Pi 3 ARM CPU running  in 32 bit mode. * The Ubuntu ARM tests were conducted on a Raspberry Pi 4 ARM CPU running in  64 bit mode.* All others were conducted using VMs running on x86 hardware. ---------------------------------------------------------------------Installation============Please note that this is a Python 3 package. To install using Pip, you will need (with Debian package in brackets):* The appropriate C compiler and header files (gcc and build-essential).* The Python3 development headers (python3-dev).* Pip3 together with the corresponding Setuptools (python3-pip).example::# Install from PyPI.pip3 install arrayfunc# Force install from PyPI source instead of using a binary wheel.pip3 install --user --force-reinstall --no-binary=:all: arrayfunc# Install from a local copy of the source package (Linux).pip3 install --no-index --find-links=. arrayfunc# Install a local package as a user package.pip3 install --user --no-index --find-links=. arrayfunc# Windows, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD seems to use &quot;pip&quot; instead # of &quot;pip3&quot; for some reason.pip install arrayfuncNewer versions of OpenBSD and FreeBSD will not install this package correctly when running setup.py directly. Use pip to install, even for local packageinstalls. Testing of this package has been changed to use only pip (or pip3)in order to provide a common testing method for all platforms. Testing usingsetup.py directly is no longer done.Recent versions of PyPI seem to be building their own binary wheels for some platforms using their own infrastruction. This may result in an invalid ARM binary on Raspberry Pi. If you have difficulties, then either download the tar.gz version and install it locally (see the above instructions for a local install). Alternatively,see the above example for how to force a binary install instead of using a wheel. There is also a bash script called &quot;setupuser.sh&quot; which will call setup.py directly with the appropriate parameters. The setup.py file has platform detection code which it uses to pass the correct flags to the C compiler. For ARM, this includes the CPU type. If youare using an ARM CPU type which is not recognized then setup.py may notcompile in SIMD features. You can experiment with modifying setup.py to addnew ARM models, but be sure that anything you try is compatible with the existing ones.Installing on Linux with PIP and PEP-668----------------------------------------PEP-668 (PEPs describe changes to Python) introduced a new feature which canaffect how packages are installed with PIP. If PIP is configured to be EXTERNALLY-MANAGED it will refuse to install a package outside of a virtualenvironment.The intention of this is to prevent conflicts between packages which are installed using the system package manager, and ones which are installed usingPIP.Linux distros which are affeced by this include the latest versions of Debianand Ubuntu.As this package is a library which is intended to be used by other applications, there is no one right way to install it, whether inside or outside of a virtual environment. Review the options available with PIP to seewhat is suitable for your application.For testing purposes this package was installed by setting the environmentvariable PIP_BREAK_SYSTEM_PACKAGES to &quot;1&quot;, which effectively disables thisfeature in PIP. example::export PIP_BREAK_SYSTEM_PACKAGES=1---------------------------------------------------------------------Release History===============* 8.5.1 - Update to testing and support. There were no code. changes.           Ubuntu version updated to 23.04. AlmaLinux updated to 9.1.           Alpine Linux updated to 3.17.3. FreeBSD updated to 13.2.           OpenBSD updated to 7.3.           On Ubuntu 23.04, the installation method has changed due to how           PEP-668 was implemented by Debian and how this affects &quot;pip&quot;.           Some other distros may experience the same problems if they made           the same changes. See the README.TxT for details. * 8.5.0 - Added pyproject.toml file to satisfy Python 3.11 requirements.          Updated build scripts to use python3 -m build instead of calling          setup.py directly. Test targets were updated, Ubuntu 20.04 was           dropped, Ubuntu 22.10 was added, FreeBSD python version upgraded           to 3.9, OpenBSD upgraded to 7.2, Windows 10 Python upgraded to 3.11,          Windows 11 Python upgraded to 3.11. Removed duplicate assignment in          parameter parsing return data in arrayparams_asum.c.           Added __version__ attribute to allow checking package version           number at run time. Added version unit test. Updated setup.py           and other files to allow the version number to be automatically           updated from a single source at build time.* 8.4.1 - Minor bug fix for asum for unsigned integer SIMD on ARM. This           corrects the function return type for SIMD operations on ARM.          No incorrect behaviour was found in the original, but this change          was made to ensure correctness. * 8.4.0 - Major performance improvements for asum through the use of SIMD and          other optimizations. * 8.3.0 - Fixed the effects of an apparent compiler bug affecting 32 bit           x86 only for function asum. Tested and verified on 32 bit Debian           and 32 bit Alpine. This would in a few very specific circumstances           result in the sum of a float array (array code 'f') exceeding           the valid range for a float instead of returning infinity. The          fix forces the result to infinity in these cases. Also tested          with new releases of Alma 9 and Alpine 3.16. * 8.2.0 - Update to testing and support. Tested with new releases of Ubuntu           22.04 and OpenBSD 7.1. Changed &quot;simdsupport&quot; to also report the           architecture the binary was compiled for. &quot;Simdsupport&quot; is only          used for testing and benchmarking and is not a stable part of          the release.* 8.1.2 - Bump to correct minor documentation error in README.rst. * 8.1.1 - Update to testing and support. Raspberry Pi 32 bit OS updated to          version 2022-04-04. Update to setup.py to improve ARM version           detection.* 8.1.0 - Update to testing and support. Centos has been replaced by           AlmaLinux due to Red Hat ending long term support for Centos.          No actual code changes.* 8.0.1 - Technical bump to version number to include update information.* 8.0.0 - Performance improvements in add, sub, mul, neg, abs, ceil, floor,           trunc, sqrt, degrees, radians. Asum will now use error checking           with floating point SIMD by default where available. Benchmarks          and unit tests have been updated accordingly.* 7.2.0 - Performance improvements in asum and pow. Asum will now use error          checking with floating point SIMD on x86_64 by default. Pow has          special cases for powers of 2 and 3 on integer arrays which allow          for much greater performance. Pow will now raise a value error          exception if an attempt to raise to a negative number. This makes it          it more compatible with Python. New functions pow2 and pow3 added          which raise array values to powers of 2 and 3 respectively. These          have additional optimisations beyond pow, particularly with floating          point arrays. Benchmarks for add, floordiv, mod, mul, pow, sub, and          truediv have been changed to make them run the expanded range of          tests much faster. * 7.1.0 - This is a bugfix release to correct mod, mul, and pow. This affects          integer overflow checking at extremes, particularly with the greatest          magnitude negative number on signed arrays. Certain combinations of          numbers may have produced an overflow error when the result was at           the negative margin of the numeric range (e.g. -128 for array type          'b' when -2 is raised to the power of 7). The errors have been fixed,          including adding special cases. Also, when 1 or -1 was raised to a          very large power this would cause the algorithm to work for a very          long time to produce an answer (e.g. 1 to the power of 4 billion).          This is now detected and a special case added to short circuit the          calculation to produce the answer. The unit tests for these and           related functions have been updated to include a much wider range           of test data.* 7.0.0 - Major speed improvements to add, sub, mul, abs, neg using SIMD with           overflow checking on integer array types. SIMD is now active as the           default on integer arrays with smaller word sizes for these           functions. Major speed improvements on x86 for lshift and rshift by          adding SIMD support to addition integer array types. This was already          present on ARM. Added benchmark for &quot;convert&quot; (this was missing).           Debian test platforms were updated to latest versions (11). * 6.2.0 - Updated benchmarks to make each one a separate file. Centos and          OpenSuse test platforms updated to latest versions.* 6.1.1 - Documentation updated and version number bumped to reflect testing           with Ubuntu 21.04, FreeBSD 13.0, and OpenBSD 6.9. No code changes.* 6.1.0 - Changed convguardbands to narrow -ve guard bands by 1 to handle           LLVM warning. Changed setup.py to detect Raspberry Pi 4 and set the           compiler args accordingly. Added support for Pi 4. Dropped testing           of 64 bit mode on Pi 3. * 6.0.1 - Documentation updated to reflect testing with the release version          of Ubuntu 20.04 ARM (Rasberry Pi), Ubuntu 2010 (x86-64), OpenBSD 6.8,          and Python 3.9 on Windows. No code changes and no change in version           number.* 6.0.0 - Documentation updated to reflect testing with the release version          of Ubuntu 20.04. No code changes and no change in version number.* 6.0.0 - Added SIMD support for ARMv8 AARCH64. This is 64 bit ARM on a          Raspberry Pi3 when running 64 bit Ubuntu. Raspbian is 32 bit only          and has 64 bit SIMD vectors. 64 bit ARM has 128 bit SIMD vectors          and so offers improved performance.* 5.1.1 - Updated and improved help documentation. Also updated test          platforms and retested.* 5.1.0 - This is a bug fix release only, centred around SIMD issues on          x86-64 with GCC. In a previous release some of the x86-64 SIMD           code had been changed to take advantage of a sort of assisted          auto-vectorisation present in GCC. However, certain operations          on certain integer sizes with certain array types will cause           GCC to generate incorrect x86 SIMD operations, producting           integer overflow. The functions known to be affected are aall,           aany, findindex (B, H, I arrays), eq, ge, gt, le, lt, ne (B,           H, I arrays), and rshift (h, i arrays). ARM was not affected.           All auto-vectorisation, where used, has been changed back to           manually generated SIMD operations for both x86 and ARM.           Rshift no longer uses SIMD  operations for b, B, h, or i           arrays on x86. Lshift no longer  supports SIMD operations on           b or B arrays on x86. Add and sub no longer use SIMD for B, H,          and I arrays on x86. Mul no longer uses SIMD on x86 for any          array types. Where SIMD functionality has been removed on x86,           it of course is still supported through normal portable CPU           instructions. ARM SIMD support was not affected by these          changes. Lost SIMD acceleration will be returned to x86 in a          later release where possible after the necessary research has          been conducted. Unit tests have been updated to cover a           greater range of integer values to test for this problem.           Platforms using compilers other than GCC were not affected by           this, as they did not use SIMD anyway. The main effect of this          present change is that some calculations may be slower for          some array types. The problem with GCC generating incorrect          SIMD instructions in some circumstances is apparently a known           (but obscure) issue. This will be avoided in future releases          by sticking with manual SIMD built-ins. Some source code files           have updated date stamps in this release but no substantive           code changes due to the template system used to auto-generate           code.* 5.0.0 - The main focus of this release has been adding SIMD           acceleration support to the ARMv7 platform  (e.g. Raspberry           Pi 3). Also added SIMD support to 'lshift' and 'rshift' on          x86-64 and ARM. Changed arrayparamsbase to fix compiler           warning on newer versions of GCC, but no change in actual          operation. Updated supported OS versions tested, and added          OpenBSD to supported platform list.* 4.3.1 - Numerous performance inprovements through the use of SIMD          acceleration in many functions. See the documentation to          see which functions are affected. Restrictions on the use of           non-finite data in parameters has been relaxed where possible.           Repeat now allows non-finite data as fill values. For           findindices, if no matches are found the result code is now           0 (zero) instead of -1.* 4.2.0 - Added fma function. This has no equivalent in the Python           standard library but is equivalent to x * y + z. Also changed          list of supported platforms to update FreeBSD to version 12          and added Centos 7.* 4.1.0 - Added isfinite function.* 4.0.1 - Repeat upload to synchronise source and Windows binary &quot;wheel&quot;          version. PyPI was not happy with the previous attempt. * 4.0.0 - Major revision with many changes. Amap, starmap, and acalc were           replaced with new individual functions. This change was made to           provides a simpler and more consistent interface which is tailored to          the individual function rather than attempting to make one parameter           format fit all. The &quot;disovfl&quot; parameter has been named to &quot;matherrors&quot;           in order to better reflect that it encompasses more than just integer          overflow. Support for the &quot;bytes&quot; type has been removed. The Raspberry          Pi has been added as a supported platform.* 3.1.0 - Added log2 to amap, amapi, and acalc.* 3.0.0 - Changed package format to &quot;Wheel&quot; files. No functional changes.* 2.1.1 - Fixed missing header files in PyPI package. No functional changes.* 2.0.0 - Many changes. Updated MS Windows support to 3.6 and latest compiler.          This in turn brought the Windows version up to feature parity with          the other versions. Changed supported MS Windows version from 32 bit          to 64 bit. Added SIMD support for some functions which provided a           significant performance for those affected. Updated supported versions          of Debian and FreeBSD to current releases.* 1.1.0 - Added support for math constants math.pi and math.e.* 1.0.0 - First release.</longdescription>

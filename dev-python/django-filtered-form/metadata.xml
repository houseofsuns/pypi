	<longdescription>=====================django-filtered-form=====================---------------Installation---------------In your virtualenv, use ``pip install django-filteredform``.You don't need to install it into your ``settings.INSTALLED_APPS``, as it does not provide any models or templates, only forms.---------------Usage---------------Declarative way to define filters on fields on a django model form::    from django import forms    from people.models import Person    from filtered_form.forms import FilteringForm        class PersonAdminForm(FilteringForm):        class Meta:            model = Person                instance_filters = {            'units': 'company.units'        }        filters = {            'units': models.Q(is_active=True),            'colours__in': ['red','blue','green']        }~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~``instance_filters``~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~``instance_filters`` are things that allow for relational filters to be applied.For instance, if you have a triple of models, ``Person``, ``Unit`` and ``Company``, and every person and unit have a foreign key to a company, you canuse an instance filter to easily select only the associated company's units fora queryset when viewing a person.Alternatively, you can supply a queryset method (that does not require arguments),for more filtering::    instance_filters = {        'units': 'company.units.active'    }~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~plain ``filters``~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~A more conventional filter structure, that allows you to supply a ``Q`` object, ora dict of key-value pairs, which will be passed to ``.filter()`` on the queryset.You can quite easily shoot yourself in the foot if your filter keys are not validarguments for a filter function on that queryset.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~FormSets~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~You can either create a form using this method, and then pass that to your formsetclass or factory. Or, you can have a formset class based on ``filtered_form.forms.FilteredFormSet``,which will also set up the queryset values on the empty form correctly, which is veryuseful if you are using dynamic forms.---------------Version History---------------~~~~~~~~1.0.3~~~~~~~~Fix a bug where new objects could not be created in the django admin.~~~~~~~~1.0.1~~~~~~~~Improve documentation.Allow for a callable in the value of an ``instance_filter``.Allow for a dict in the value of a ``filter``.~~~~~~~~1.0~~~~~~~~Initial Release.</longdescription>

Each new service should subclass ``Service`` (or one of its morespecific children, where appropriate) from the ``core.py`` file. The mix-inclasses in ``auth.py`` can be used to implement authentication to the serviceAPI endpoint as needed (currently both header and query parameter tokenvalidation are supported).* Create a new ``Service`` subclass, or use one of the pre-provided  subclasses for continuous integration or version control systems;* Use the mix-ins from ``auth.py`` and ``core.py`` to add any required  authentication, custom root setting and/or health thresholds;* Define the ``ROOT`` service URL (used for all requests) and ``ENDPOINT``  URL template (which will be filled in with attributes defined on the service  instance) - for many cases, the default ``update`` implementation will do  what you need it to based on these;* Define any additional ``REQUIRED`` configuration parameters on the class  (note that ``__init__`` keyword arguments without default values and any  required parameters defined in superclasses will be added automatically);* Define any ``PROVIDED`` configuration parameters (i.e. those that other  classes require that your class provides - see ``BasicAuthHeaderMixin`` for  an example);* Set the appropriate ``TEMPLATE`` for it (if not a standard template, add it  to ``templates/partials`` - use the `Jinja2`_ templating language), and note  that the service data will be exposed to the template as ``service_data``  for the initial load data binding and for clients without JavaScript;* Set the ``FRIENDLY_NAME``, for display in the top-left of each pane, if not  the same as the class name;* Register the service in **both** ``SERVICES`` objects, using the same key:  * in Python (``__init__.py``); and  * in JavaScript (``static/scripts/services.js``, where any service-specific    client-side behaviour should also be placed)... _Buddy: https://buddy.works/.. _CircleCI: https://circleci.com/.. _Codeship: https://codeship.com/.. _Coveralls: https://coveralls.io/.. _Flash: https://github.com/textbook/flash.. _GitHub: https://github.com/.. _GitHub Enterprise: https://enterprise.github.com/home.. _Jenkins: https://jenkins.io/.. _Jinja2: http://jinja.pocoo.org/.. _Pivotal Tracker: https://www.pivotaltracker.com/.. _Read the Docs: https://flash-services.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.. _Travis API docs: https://docs.travis-ci.com/api?shell#authentication.. _Travis CI (.org): https://travis-ci.org/.. _Travis CI (.com): https://travis-ci.com/</longdescription>

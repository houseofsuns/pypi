With Examples  - The package was created with the intention of being as easy to use as possbile.  - To that extent, there are 4 basic usage examples and over 10 advanced usage examples.- Complex When Required  - The default is simplicity, but the package can step up when required to do so.  - Any actions outside of the simple scenario of getting an optional string    value should be relatively easy to request of the package API.- Hierarchically Aware  - By default, uses the `.` character in the property names to define levels    of hierarchy.  - Hierarchy levels can be used to find only those properties that exist under    a given hierarchy.  - If desired, the `ApplicationPropertiesFacade` object can be used to    restrict access to only those properties that exist under a given hierarchy.- Command Line Aware  - The `set_manual_property` function allows for one or more individual    properties to be supplied by the command line.- Extensible  - The loading of the properties is separate from access to the values for    those properties.  - Due to the separation of the loading and accessing parts of the library,    custom loading classes can be added with ease.    - Current loading classes include loaders for Json files, with Simple      Property files right around the corner## RequirementsThis project required Python 3.8 or later to function.## Installation```shpip install app_prop```## API DocumentationThe full documentation on the API is available in the [API document](dd).As that document is rather dry, more information is provided in the way ofexamples in the [How To Use This Package section](dd) of the home page.## How To Use, And Other StuffFor more information on this library please consult the various othersection on the home page.</longdescription>

That is, graders do not perform  grade calculation; they only gather information about students' work* Simple configuration: update one YAML file and store your graders in  git repositories for all your TAs* Relative weighting: no more twiddling with weights to get them to add  up to 100* Import submissions from Gradescope, Canvas Assignments, or Canvas  Quizzes* No more copy-and-pasting grades and commments: automated upload of  Canvas grades and gradelogs* Flatten (extract) archived submissions* Gradescope integration: generate a Gradescope autograder tarball for  an assignment with one commandCredits---------* Austin Adams (@ausbin) for creating lc3grade, which eventually became  zucchini* Cem Gokmen (@skyman) for suggesting converting lc3grade into a  generalized autograder for more than just C and LC-3 homeworks, and  creating the initial structure of zucchini* Patrick Tam (@pjztam) for implementing a bunch of graders, gradelogs,  and gradelog upload* Kexin Zhang (@kexin-zhang) for exploring Canvas bulk submission  downloads and for creating the demo downloader, which changed our  lives* Travis Adams (@travis-adams) for nothing=======History=======0.1.0 (2017-12-17)------------------* First release on PyPI.</longdescription>

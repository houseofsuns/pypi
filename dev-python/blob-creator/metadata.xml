They have a size, a weight, a color and a cuteness level. As you can see, a blob dataset contains all types of variables that you can find in the wild (nominal, ordinal and metric).## Generator OutputThis generator creates a population of blobs. It delivers (a) an Excel data frame with every blob's properties, (b) a population plot that visualizes all blobs for presentation purposes and (c) a set of visualizations of the population data.![Dataframe](https://github.com/mckoh/blob_creator/raw/main/static/dataframe.png)The **population plot** displays all blobs with color and size. In addition to that, it shows blob names. There are three different kinds of base images that can be used to visualize blobs.![Blob population](https://github.com/mckoh/blob_creator/raw/main/static/population_alien.png)The **visualization plot** inklude a histogram of blob size and blob weights, as well as a bar chart with cuteness level counts and a scatter plot of size and weight.![Blob population analysis](https://github.com/mckoh/blob_creator/raw/main/static/histograms.png)## Use the GeneratorBlob populations can either have large (12) or small (1) **variability**, determined by the population's scatter index. Moreover, they can consist of a large **number** of monsters or can also be small, determined by the population's n.You can **generate a new population** by calling:```pythonfrom blob_creator.core import BlobFactory# This instantiates a new blob factoryblob_factory = BlobFactory(n=20, scatter=12, kind=&quot;monster&quot;)# This will create the blobsblob_factory.create_blobs()# This will export your dataset and your population plot to diskblob_factory.export_data()# Upload the csv file of the popoulation to share# it with your studentsblob_factory.upload_dataset()# Finally, the output directory can be cleaned-upblob_factory.delete_individual_pngs()```## Package InstallationThis package can be installed using Python's package index. Use the following command to do this:```shellpip install blob-creator```</longdescription>

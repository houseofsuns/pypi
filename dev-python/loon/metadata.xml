Idea for developing **loon** comes from [**sync-deploy**](https://github.com/ShixiangWang/sync-deploy), which is limited by its pure bash code. Therefore, I use Python to implement it and more features will be added to it in the future. ## InstallationInstall from pypi:```bashpip install loon```Install from GitHub:```bashpip install git+https://github.com/ShixiangWang/loon```## Usage### ConfigurationTo access remote host without typing password, you have to generate ssh key with `ssh-keygen` command if it is not available.```shell$ ssh-keygen```Follow the commands, for simplicity, just type `ENTER` to proceed.Copy your key to remote server, replace `user` with your `username` and `host` with your remote host ip address.```shell$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa user@host```### Host management- Add a remote host```shell$ loon add -U wsx -H 127.0.0.1 -P 22=&gt; Added successfully!# Default port is 22, so don't need to specify it# And we can create a host alias, otherwise# it is same as username of remote host$ loon add -U wsx -H 127.0.0.2 -N host2      =&gt; Added successfully!```- List all remote hosts```shell$ loon list+-----+--------+----------+----+|Alias|Username|IP address|Port|+-----+--------+----------+----+|&lt;wsx&gt;|wsx     |127.0.0.1 |22  |+-----+--------+----------+----+|host2|wsx     |127.0.0.2 |22  |+-----+--------+----------+----+&lt;active host&gt;```- Rename alias```shell$ loon rename wsx host1$ loon list+-------+--------+----------+----+|Alias  |Username|IP address|Port|+-------+--------+----------+----+|&lt;host1&gt;|wsx     |127.0.0.1 |22  |+-------+--------+----------+----+|host2  |wsx     |127.0.0.2 |22  |+-------+--------+----------+----+&lt;active host&gt;```- Switch active remote host```shell$ loon switch -N host2=&gt; Activated.$ loon list+-------+--------+----------+----+|Alias  |Username|IP address|Port|+-------+--------+----------+----+|host1  |wsx     |127.0.0.1 |22  |+-------+--------+----------+----+|&lt;host2&gt;|wsx     |127.0.0.2 |22  |+-------+--------+----------+----+&lt;active host&gt;```- Delete a host```shell$ loon delete -N host2=&gt; Removing host from available list...=&gt; Removing active host...=&gt; Changing active host to host1$ loon list+-------+--------+----------+----+|Alias  |Username|IP address|Port|+-------+--------+----------+----+|&lt;host1&gt;|wsx     |127.0.0.1 |22  |+-------+--------+----------+----+&lt;active host&gt;```### Common tasks- Run commands```shell$ loon run 'ls -l ~'total 168drwxr-xr-x     2 wsx liulab     25 Apr  7 23:26 bindrwxr-xr-x.    2 wsx liulab      6 Apr  4 10:36 Desktopdrwxr-xr-x.    2 wsx liulab      6 Apr  4 10:36 Documentsdrwxr-xr-x.    3 wsx liulab     69 Jun 10 16:57 Downloadsdrwxr-xr-x     2 wsx liulab      6 Sep 30 10:23 facetdrwxr-xr-x    11 wsx liulab   4096 Sep 22 20:13 metawhodrwxr-xr-x.    2 wsx liulab      6 Apr  4 10:36 Musicdrwxr-xr-x     3 wsx liulab     60 Apr 30 17:50 Notebooksdrwxr-xr-x.    2 wsx liulab      6 Apr  4 10:36 Picturesdrwxr-xr-x     6 wsx liulab    114 Sep 27 17:33 projectsdrwxr-xr-x     6 wsx liulab     96 Jun 27 16:50 projects_bkdrwxr-xr-x.    2 wsx liulab      6 Apr  4 10:36 Publicdrwxr-xr-x.    2 wsx liulab      6 Apr  4 10:36 Templatesdrwxr-xr-x     5 wsx liulab   4096 Oct  3 12:24 testdrwxr-xr-x  3480 wsx liulab 114688 Oct  3 13:44 tmpdrwxr-xr-x     3 wsx liulab     32 Aug 22 17:13 toolsdrwxr-xr-x.    2 wsx liulab      6 Apr  4 10:36 Videos```- Run local scriptsThis will upload scripts to remote host firstly, then run them.```shell$ loon run -f ../../tests/scripts/t*.py=&gt; Starting upload...t1.py                                          100%   50    49.0KB/s   00:00    t2.py                                          100%   50    77.6KB/s   00:00    =&gt; Finished uploading in 1s=&gt; Getting results:This is t1 script.This is t2 script.```- If input contains both files and directories, all files in directory will not be executed. This is a way to include child scripts which does not need to be executed. - If input is only a directory, all scripts (not including scripts in subdirectories) under it will be executed. This is the way to maintain an independent project.You can include data directory using `--data` flag, specify program like `bash` or `python` using `--prog` flag and set remote directory using `--dir` flag.- Upload and download files Use them like `cp` command. At default, use `scp` command to do the job, set `--rsync` to use `rsync` command (`--rsync` is disabled in Windows). Note there are some differences between scp and rsync, especially processing directory.```shell$ loon upload -husage: loon upload [-h] [-v] [--rsync] source [source ...] destinationpositional arguments:  source         Source files to upload  destination    Remote destination directoryoptional arguments:  -h, --help     show this help message and exit  -v, --verbose  set loglevel to INFO  --rsync        Use rsync instead of scpoptional arguments:  -h, --help     show this help message and exit  -v, --verbose  set loglevel to INFO$ loon download -husage: loon download [-h] [-v] [--rsync] source [source ...] destinationpositional arguments:  source         Source files to download  destination    Local destination directory, note '~' should be quoted in                 some casesoptional arguments:  -h, --help     show this help message and exit  -v, --verbose  set loglevel to INFO  --rsync        Use rsync instead of scp```- Batch process commandsBy providing a structed stdin/file (CSV, TSV etc) and a sample command with placeholders `{index}` refer to column index (0 based) or column name of file, `batch` command can be used to execute a batch of commands. Users can set thread number by `-T` flag and use `--dry` flag to dry run the code.```shell$ loon batch -f src/loon/data/samplefile.csv 'echo hello {0}'hello TCGA-2A-A8VO-01hello TCGA-2A-A8VT-01hello TCGA-2A-A8VV-01hello TCGA-2A-A8VX-01$ loon batch -f src/loon/data/samplefile.csv 'echo hello {0}' -T 4hello TCGA-2A-A8VO-01hello TCGA-2A-A8VT-01hello TCGA-2A-A8VV-01hello TCGA-2A-A8VX-01$ loon batch -f src/loon/data/samplefile.csv 'echo hello {0}' --dry=&gt; Running echo hello TCGA-2A-A8VO-01=&gt; Running echo hello TCGA-2A-A8VT-01=&gt; Running echo hello TCGA-2A-A8VV-01=&gt; Running echo hello TCGA-2A-A8VX-01```You can also read the input from pipe.```shell$ echo &quot;yes,no&quot; | loon batch 'echo {0} is not {1}'yes is not no$ cat src/loon/data/samplefile.csv | loon batch 'echo sample {0} has a longer name {1}'sample TCGA-2A-A8VO-01 has a longer name TCGA-2A-A8VO-01-01sample TCGA-2A-A8VT-01 has a longer name TCGA-2A-A8VT-01-01sample TCGA-2A-A8VV-01 has a longer name TCGA-2A-A8VV-01-01sample TCGA-2A-A8VX-01 has a longer name TCGA-2A-A8VX-01-01```You can also handle header and refer to column names with index or name!```$ cat tests/header.txt | loon batch 'echo hello {0}' hello userhello wsxhello zd$ cat tests/header.txt | loon batch 'echo hello {0}' --headerhello wsxhello zd$ cat tests/header.txt | loon batch 'echo hello {0}, your score is {1}' --headerhello wsx, your score is 100hello zd, your score is 100$ cat tests/header.txt | loon 'echo hello {user}, your score is {score}' --headerhello wsx, your score is 100hello zd, your score is 100$ cat tests/header2.txt | loon 'echo hello {user name}, your score is {score}' --headerhello wsx, your score is 100hello zd, your score is 100```- Generate a batch of (script) files`gen` command is similar to the `pbsgen` command below, but removes the `.pbs` file extension,so users have to add the file extension in the first column of the SAMPLEFILE if necessary.The example files can be generated using `pbsgen_example`.```usage: loon gen [-h] [-v] [-t TEMPLATE] [-s SAMPLEFILE] [-m MAPFILE]                       [-o OUTPUT]optional arguments:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  -v, --verbose         set loglevel to INFO  -t TEMPLATE, --template TEMPLATE                        A template file containing placeholders  -s SAMPLEFILE, --samplefile SAMPLEFILE                        A csv file containing unique filenames (the first                        column) and replacing labels  -m MAPFILE, --mapfile MAPFILE                        A csv file containing placeholders and column index                        (0-based) indicating replacing labels in samplefile  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT                        Output directory```### PBS management and tasks* `pbstemp` - Generate a PBS template file* `pbsgen`  - Generate a batch of PBS files* `pbsgen_example` - Generate example files for pbsgen command* `pbssub` - Submit PBS tasks* `pbsdeploy` - Upload a target directory and submit containing PBS files (have `.pbs` extension)* `pbscheck` - Check status of PBS job on remote hostMore details please see `-h` option of the commands above.### Current usage info```shellusage: loon [-h] [-V] [--author]                   {add,delete,switch,list,rename,run,upload,download,gen,batch,pbstemp,pbsgen,pbsgen_example,pbssub,pbsdeploy,pbscheck}                   ...Be an efficient loon.optional arguments:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  --version             show program's version number and exit  --author              show info of program's authorsubcommands:  {add,delete,switch,list,rename,run,upload,download,gen,batch,pbstemp,pbsgen,pbsgen_example,pbssub,pbsdeploy,pbscheck}                        description    add                 Add a remote host    delete              Delete a remote host    switch              Switch active remote host    list                List all remote hosts    rename              Rename host alias    run                 Run commands or scripts on remote    upload              Upload files to active remote host    download            Download files from active remote host    gen                 Generate a batch of (script) files    batch               Batch process commands with placeholders    pbstemp             Generate a PBS template file    pbsgen              Generate a batch of PBS files (with .pbs extension)    pbsgen_example      Generate example files for pbsgen command    pbssub              Submit PBS tasks    pbsdeploy           Deploy target destination to remote host    pbscheck            Check status of PBS job on remote host```## NoteThis project has been set up using PyScaffold 3.2.2.

As of SpectRes v2.2.0, we do not see discrepant results between using SpectRes and SpectReC.## InstallationSpectResC can be installed using pip```pip install spectresc```## DocumentationPlease refer to the original SpectRes for the [documentation](https://spectres.readthedocs.io).## CitationIf you have made use of SpectResC, please reference:1. the original SpectRes [arXiv article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05165)2. the [zenodo DOI](https://zenodo.org/record/7863171) for SpectResC</longdescription>

	<longdescription># akashic_records`akashic_records` is a Python package that dynamically generates functions using OpenAI code completion based on what is imported and how it is used.InstallationTo install the akashic_records package, you can use pip:```bashpip install akashic_records```## UsageBehaviour of the `akashic_records` package is based on _what_ you import from it, and _how_ you use it.The package generates functions on the fly based on the name you import and the way you call it.```pythonfrom akashic_records import quick_sortarr = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]result = quick_sort(arr)print(result)  # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 9]```The package will end up making requests to the OpenAI completations endpoint with the `code-davinci-002` model.The above code will end up generating this prompt:```def quick_sort(arr: list):```Note that the parameter name matches the name of the argument that was passed in. If a constant is passed in instead of an identifier, generic names such as `p0` and `p1` will be used. To have a useful name with a constant argument, use keyword arguments.## Return type and docstringsThis package (ab)uses type hints to give more information to the completion process.```pythonfrom typing import Annotatedfrom akashic_records import merge_sortunsorted_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]result: Annotated[list, &quot;&quot;&quot;Sorts the input list using the mergesort algorithm.Parameters:-----------unsorted_list : list    The input list to be sorted.Returns:--------list    The sorted list.&quot;&quot;&quot;] = merge_sort(unsorted_list)print(result)  # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 9]```Generates the following prompt:```def merge_sort(unsorted_list: list) -&gt; list:    &quot;&quot;&quot;    Sorts the input list using the mergesort algorithm.    Parameters:    -----------    unsorted_list : list        The input list to be sorted.    Returns:    --------    list        The sorted list.    &quot;&quot;&quot;```If you would like to include a docstring but not a return type, only use a string for the type annotation instead of using `typing.Annotated`.## DecoratorIf you don't like the somewhat magical mechanisms by which the above functionality works (extracting type hints and argument variable names), the packge also supplies a decorator with the same functionality.```pythonfrom akashic_records import generate@generate(n=1, temperature=0.1, max_tokens=256)def merge_sort(unsorted_list: list) -&gt; list:    &quot;&quot;&quot;    Sorts the input list using the mergesort algorithm.    Parameters:    -----------    unsorted_list : list        The input list to be sorted.    Returns:    --------    list        The sorted list.    &quot;&quot;&quot;print(merge_sort([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]))  # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 9]```### How does the parameter name/type hint thing work?The very neat [sorcery](https://github.com/alexmojaki/sorcery) package by [Alex Hall](https://github.com/alexmojaki).## OptionsThe OpenaAI completaions endpoint has many options. Some of these are available for tweaking.```from akashic_records import configconfig.n = 3 # https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create#completions/create-nconfig.max_tokens = 512 # https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create#completions/create-max_tokensconfig.temperature = 0.2 # https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create#completions/create-temperature```Some additional options are available to control the prompt generation process.```from akashic_records import configconfig.type_hint = True # Set to False to disable all type hints in prompts# The package isn't always able to get a working completion from the API.# In the event that something goes wrong (syntax error in the generated code, runtime error trying to run it, etc)# The package will try to generate new completions.# The `attempts` value controls how many times it will try.config.attempts = 5 # Set to -1 for unlimited tries.```## What's with the name?The name `akashic_records` is inspired by the spiritual belief of the [Akashic Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akashic_records). In this belief, the Akashic Records are a repository all universal events, thoughts, words, emotions and intent ever to have occurred in the past, present, or future in terms of all entities and life forms.This seemed fitting for a package that in some sense contains the implementation of &quot;every function&quot;.</longdescription>

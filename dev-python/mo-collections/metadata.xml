	<longdescription>More Collections================Some useful data structures for collections of data### Class `Index`Provide indexing for a list. Inner properties can be used for keys, and keys can be tuples of properties.  ### Class `UniqueIndex`Same as Index, but includes checks and optimization to ensure members' keys are unique.### Class `Queue`A `Queue` is a list, with `add()` and `pop()`. It ensures members in the queue are not duplicated by not adding the ones already found in the queue.### Class `Matrix`A multidimensional grid of values that can be used like a `Mapping` from a-tuple-of-coordinates to the value at that coordinate. Plus a few other convenience methods.This is a naive implementation. The hope it is a simple facade to a faster implementation.### Class `Relation`Store the many-to-many relations between two domains     </longdescription>

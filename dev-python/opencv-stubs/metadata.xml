If you would like a type/function to be added or modified, please open an issue or a PR. There may also be a few errors as some types have been added progrmmatically. Please open an issue if you see one.The typing is still a work in progress, if you want a function/method to be added first you can open an issue.The stubs include the docstrings as they are otherwise not available in the IDE (as far as I know).These stubs are a temporary help until official ones are made (see [this issue](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/14590) and [this PR](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/20370)).## InstallationThe package is available on pypi [here](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-stubs/), you can install it with:```pip install opencv-stubs```The dependency on opencv is optional, and can be accessed with:- `pip install opencv-stubs[opencv]`- `pip install opencv-stubs[opencv-contrib]`- `pip install opencv-stubs[opencv-headless]`## AcknowledgementsA stub file with opencv functions can be found on the [Microsoft stubs repo](https://github.com/microsoft/python-type-stubs/tree/main/cv2). This package reused those functions (with some added typing).## TODO:- [ ] Do something about `cv2.gapi.cv`, `cv2.utils.cv2` and `cv2.mat_wrapper.cv` (do not duplicate everything if possible).- [ ] Handle cases like `cv2.misc.version.cv2.misc.version.cv2.misc.get_ocv_version()`.- [ ] Only include the `opencv-contrib` specific stubs when using `opencv-stubs[opencv-contrib]`.</longdescription>

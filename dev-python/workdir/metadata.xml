	<longdescription>=======workdir=======|Latest Version| |Travis Status| |Coveralls Status|A simple module for easily isolating temporary file I/O to a directory.  Ever developed a command-line tool which required a lot of file manipulation?  Caching, perhaps?  You don't want to use the cwd and keeping all of your paths straight if you're working outside of it can be a pain.  This tool may be the pain-reliever you need!A tale of sin and woe=====================Well, not really.  I've just developed a bunch of tools that rely on various bits of temporary or isolated file I/O, and found myself implementing this pattern over and over again.  Eventually, I got tired of doing it and decided to develop this handy module.  Now I'm passing the savings on to you!Compatibility=============As far as I know, ``workdir`` is compatible with every version of Python from 2.6 through 3.5.  It should also be compatible with all major platforms including Linux, OSX, and Windows.  If not, let me know!Installation============.. code-block ::    pip install workdirExamples========Use it as a staging area for downloaded archives:.. code:: python    import workdir    import shutil    workdir.options.path = '~/.myfilecache'    with workdir.as_cwd():        download_remote_archive('somefile')        unpack_archive('somefile', 'somedir')    shutil.copy(workdir.path_to_file('somedir', 'unpackedfilefromarchive'),                os.path.join('otherdir', 'unpackedfilefromarchive'))Use it as a working directory in your git repo (added to `.gitignore`, of course):.. code:: python    import workdir    workdir.options.path = '.gitrepo.work'    workdir.sync()    with workdir.as_cwd():        futz_with_source_tree()        more_futzing().. |Latest Version| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/workdir.svg    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/workdir    :alt: Latest Version.. |Travis Status| image:: https://img.shields.io/travis/ajk8/workdir-python/master.svg    :target: https://travis-ci.org/ajk8/workdir-python    :alt: Travis-ci build status.. |Coveralls Status| image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/github/ajk8/workdir-python/badge.svg?branch=master     :target: https://coveralls.io/github/ajk8/workdir-python?branch=master     :alt: Coveralls test coverage</longdescription>

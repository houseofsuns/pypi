	<longdescription># Azure Key Vault Administration client library for Python&gt;**Note:** The Administration library only works with [Managed HSM][managed_hsm] – functions targeting a Key Vault will fail.Azure Key Vault helps solve the following problems:- Vault administration (this library) - role-based access control (RBAC), and vault-level backup and restore options- Cryptographic key management ([azure-keyvault-keys](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-keys)) - create, store, and controlaccess to the keys used to encrypt your data- Secrets management([azure-keyvault-secrets](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-secrets)) -securely store and control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys,and other secrets- Certificate management([azure-keyvault-certificates](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-certificates)) -create, manage, and deploy public and private SSL/TLS certificates[Source code][library_src]| [Package (PyPI)][pypi_package_administration]| [Package (Conda)](https://anaconda.org/microsoft/azure-keyvault/)| [API reference documentation][reference_docs]| [Product documentation][keyvault_docs]| [Samples][administration_samples]## _Disclaimer__Azure SDK Python packages support for Python 2.7 has ended 01 January 2022. For more information and questions, please refer to https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/20691.__Python 3.7 or later is required to use this package. For more details, please refer to [Azure SDK for Python version support policy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/wiki/Azure-SDKs-Python-version-support-policy)._## Getting started### Install packagesInstall [azure-keyvault-administration][pypi_package_administration] and[azure-identity][azure_identity_pypi] with [pip][pip]:```Bashpip install azure-keyvault-administration azure-identity```[azure-identity][azure_identity] is used for Azure Active Directoryauthentication as demonstrated below.### Prerequisites* An [Azure subscription][azure_sub]* Python 3.7 or later* An existing [Key Vault Managed HSM][managed_hsm]. If you need to create one, you can do so using the Azure CLI by following the steps in [this document][managed_hsm_cli].### Authenticate the clientIn order to interact with the Azure Key Vault service, you will need an instance of either a [KeyVaultAccessControlClient](#create-a-keyvaultaccesscontrolclient) or [KeyVaultBackupClient](#create-a-keyvaultbackupclient), as well as a **vault url** (which you may see as &quot;DNS Name&quot; in the Azure Portal) and a credential object. This document demonstrates using a [DefaultAzureCredential][default_cred_ref], which is appropriate for most scenarios, including local development and production environments. We recommend using a [managed identity][managed_identity] for authentication in production environments.See [azure-identity][azure_identity] documentation for more information about other methods of authentication and their corresponding credential types.#### Create a KeyVaultAccessControlClientAfter configuring your environment for the [DefaultAzureCredential][default_cred_ref] to use a suitable method of authentication, you can do the following to create an access control client (replacing the value of `vault_url` with your Managed HSM's URL):```pythonfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredentialfrom azure.keyvault.administration import KeyVaultAccessControlClientcredential = DefaultAzureCredential()client = KeyVaultAccessControlClient(    vault_url=&quot;https://my-managed-hsm-name.managedhsm.azure.net/&quot;,    credential=credential)```&gt; **NOTE:** For an asynchronous client, import `azure.keyvault.administration.aio`'s `KeyVaultAccessControlClient` instead.#### Create a KeyVaultBackupClientAfter configuring your environment for the [DefaultAzureCredential][default_cred_ref] to use a suitable method of authentication, you can do the following to create a backup client (replacing the value of `vault_url` with your Managed HSM's URL):```pythonfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredentialfrom azure.keyvault.administration import KeyVaultBackupClientcredential = DefaultAzureCredential()client = KeyVaultBackupClient(    vault_url=&quot;https://my-managed-hsm-name.managedhsm.azure.net/&quot;,    credential=credential)```&gt; **NOTE:** For an asynchronous client, import `azure.keyvault.administration.aio`'s `KeyVaultBackupClient` instead.#### Create a KeyVaultSettingsClientAfter configuring your environment for the [DefaultAzureCredential][default_cred_ref] to use a suitable method of authentication, you can do the following to create a settings client (replacing the value of `vault_url` with your Managed HSM's URL):```pythonfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredentialfrom azure.keyvault.administration import KeyVaultSettingsClientcredential = DefaultAzureCredential()client = KeyVaultSettingsClient(    vault_url=&quot;https://my-managed-hsm-name.managedhsm.azure.net/&quot;,    credential=credential)```&gt; **NOTE:** For an asynchronous client, import `azure.keyvault.administration.aio`'s `KeyVaultSettingsClient` instead.## Key concepts### Role definitionA role definition defines the operations that can be performed, such as read, write, and delete. It can also define the operations that are excluded from allowed operations.A role definition is specified as part of a role assignment.### Role assignmentA role assignment is the association of a role definition to a service principal. They can be created, listed, fetched individually, and deleted.### KeyVaultAccessControlClientA `KeyVaultAccessControlClient` manages role definitions and role assignments.### KeyVaultBackupClientA `KeyVaultBackupClient` performs full key backups, full key restores, and selective key restores.### KeyVaultSettingsClientA `KeyVaultSettingsClient` manages Managed HSM account settings.## ExamplesThis section contains code snippets covering common tasks:* Access control    * [List all role definitions](#list-all-role-definitions)    * [Set, get, and delete a role definition](#set-get-and-delete-a-role-defintion)    * [List all role assignments](#list-all-role-assignments)    * [Create, get, and delete a role assignment](#create-get-and-delete-a-role-assignment)* Backup and restore    * [Perform a full key backup](#perform-a-full-key-backup)    * [Perform a full key restore](#perform-a-full-key-restore)### List all role definitionsList the role definitions available for assignment.```pythonfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredentialfrom azure.keyvault.administration import KeyVaultAccessControlClient, KeyVaultRoleScopecredential = DefaultAzureCredential()client = KeyVaultAccessControlClient(    vault_url=&quot;https://my-managed-hsm-name.managedhsm.azure.net/&quot;,    credential=credential)# this will list all role definitions available for assignmentrole_definitions = client.list_role_definitions(KeyVaultRoleScope.GLOBAL)for definition in role_definitions:    print(definition.id)    print(definition.role_name)    print(definition.description)```### Set, get, and delete a role definition`set_role_definition` can be used to either create a custom role definition or update an existing definition with the specified name.```pythonimport uuidfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredentialfrom azure.keyvault.administration import (    KeyVaultAccessControlClient,    KeyVaultDataAction,    KeyVaultPermission,    KeyVaultRoleScope)credential = DefaultAzureCredential()client = KeyVaultAccessControlClient(    vault_url=&quot;https://my-managed-hsm-name.managedhsm.azure.net/&quot;,    credential=credential)# create a custom role definitionpermissions = [KeyVaultPermission(allowed_data_actions=[KeyVaultDataAction.READ_HSM_KEY])]created_definition = client.set_role_definition(KeyVaultRoleScope.GLOBAL, permissions=permissions)# update the custom role definitionpermissions = [    KeyVaultPermission(allowed_data_actions=[], denied_data_actions=[KeyVaultDataAction.READ_HSM_KEY])]updated_definition = client.set_role_definition(    KeyVaultRoleScope.GLOBAL, permissions=permissions, role_name=created_definition.name)# get the custom role definitiondefinition = client.get_role_definition(KeyVaultRoleScope.GLOBAL, role_name=definition_name)# delete the custom role definitiondeleted_definition = client.delete_role_definition(KeyVaultRoleScope.GLOBAL, role_name=definition_name)```### List all role assignmentsBefore creating a new role assignment in the [next snippet](#create-get-and-delete-a-role-assignment), list all of the current role assignments:```pythonfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredentialfrom azure.keyvault.administration import KeyVaultAccessControlClient, KeyVaultRoleScopecredential = DefaultAzureCredential()client = KeyVaultAccessControlClient(    vault_url=&quot;https://my-managed-hsm-name.managedhsm.azure.net/&quot;,    credential=credential)# this will list all role assignmentsrole_assignments = client.list_role_assignments(KeyVaultRoleScope.GLOBAL)for assignment in role_assignments:    print(assignment.name)    print(assignment.principal_id)    print(assignment.role_definition_id)```### Create, get, and delete a role assignmentAssign a role to a service principal. This will require a role definition ID and service principal object ID. You can use an ID from the retrieved [list of role definitions](#list-all-role-definitions) for the former, and an assignment's `principal_id` from the list retrieved in the [above snippet](#list-all-role-assignments) for the latter.```pythonfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredentialfrom azure.keyvault.administration import KeyVaultAccessControlClient, KeyVaultRoleScopecredential = DefaultAzureCredential()client = KeyVaultAccessControlClient(    vault_url=&quot;https://my-managed-hsm-name.managedhsm.azure.net/&quot;,    credential=credential)# Replace &lt;role-definition-id&gt; with the id of a definition from the fetched list from an earlier examplerole_definition_id = &quot;&lt;role-definition-id&gt;&quot;# Replace &lt;service-principal-object-id&gt; with the principal_id of an assignment returned from the previous exampleprincipal_id = &quot;&lt;service-principal-object-id&gt;&quot;# first, let's create the role assignmentrole_assignment = client.create_role_assignment(KeyVaultRoleScope.GLOBAL, role_definition_id, principal_id)print(role_assignment.name)print(role_assignment.principal_id)print(role_assignment.role_definition_id)# now, we get itrole_assignment = client.get_role_assignment(KeyVaultRoleScope.GLOBAL, role_assignment.name)print(role_assignment.name)print(role_assignment.principal_id)print(role_assignment.role_definition_id)# finally, we delete this role assignmentrole_assignment = client.delete_role_assignment(KeyVaultRoleScope.GLOBAL, role_assignment.name)print(role_assignment.name)print(role_assignment.principal_id)print(role_assignment.role_definition_id)```### Perform a full key backupBack up your entire collection of keys. The backing store for full key backups is a blob storage container using Shared Access Signature authentication.For more details on creating a SAS token using the `BlobServiceClient`, see the sample [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob/samples/blob_samples_authentication.py#L105).Alternatively, it is possible to [generate a SAS token in Storage Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vs-azure-tools-storage-manage-with-storage-explorer?tabs=windows#generate-a-shared-access-signature-in-storage-explorer)```pythonfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredentialfrom azure.keyvault.administration import KeyVaultBackupClientcredential = DefaultAzureCredential()client = KeyVaultBackupClient(vault_url=&quot;https://my-managed-hsm-name.managedhsm.azure.net/&quot;, credential=credential)# blob storage container URL, for example https://&lt;account name&gt;.blob.core.windows.net/backupblob_storage_url = &quot;&lt;your-blob-storage-url&gt;&quot;sas_token = &quot;&lt;your-sas-token&gt;&quot;  # replace with a sas token to your storage account# Backup is a long-running operation. The client returns a poller object whose result() method# blocks until the backup is complete, then returns an object representing the backup operation.backup_poller = client.begin_backup(blob_storage_url, sas_token)backup_operation = backup_poller.result()# this is the Azure Storage Blob URL of the backupprint(backup_operation.folder_url)```### Perform a full key restoreRestore your entire collection of keys from a backup. The data source for a full key restore is a storage blob accessed using Shared Access Signature authentication.You will also need the `azure_storage_blob_container_uri` from the [above snippet](#perform-a-full-key-backup).For more details on creating a SAS token using the `BlobServiceClient`, see the sample [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob/samples/blob_samples_authentication.py#L105).Alternatively, it is possible to [generate a SAS token in Storage Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vs-azure-tools-storage-manage-with-storage-explorer?tabs=windows#generate-a-shared-access-signature-in-storage-explorer)```pythonfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredentialfrom azure.keyvault.administration import KeyVaultBackupClientcredential = DefaultAzureCredential()client = KeyVaultBackupClient(vault_url=&quot;https://my-managed-hsm-name.managedhsm.azure.net/&quot;, credential=credential)sas_token = &quot;&lt;your-sas-token&gt;&quot;  # replace with a sas token to your storage account# URL to a storage blob, for example https://&lt;account name&gt;.blob.core.windows.net/backup/mhsm-account-2020090117323313blob_url = &quot;&lt;your-blob-url&gt;&quot;# Restore is a long-running operation. The client returns a poller object whose wait() method# blocks until the restore is complete.restore_poller = client.begin_restore(blob_url, sas_token)restore_poller.wait()```## TroubleshootingSee the `azure-keyvault-administration`[troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-administration/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)for details on how to diagnose various failure scenarios.### GeneralKey Vault clients raise exceptions defined in [azure-core][azure_core_exceptions].For example, if you try to get a role assignment that doesn't exist, KeyVaultAccessControlClientraises [ResourceNotFoundError](https://aka.ms/azsdk-python-core-exceptions-resource-not-found-error):```pythonfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredentialfrom azure.keyvault.administration import KeyVaultAccessControlClientfrom azure.core.exceptions import ResourceNotFoundErrorcredential = DefaultAzureCredential()client = KeyVaultAccessControlClient(vault_url=&quot;https://my-managed-hsm-name.managedhsm.azure.net/&quot;, credential=credential)try:    client.get_role_assignment(&quot;/&quot;, &quot;which-does-not-exist&quot;)except ResourceNotFoundError as e:    print(e.message)```Clients from the Administration library can only be used to perform operations on a managed HSM, so attempting to do so on a Key Vault will raise an error.## Next stepsSeveral samples are available in the Azure SDK for Python GitHub repository.

To restore a  single key, pass the key's name to `KeyVaultBackupClient.begin_restore`:  ```  # before (4.0.0b3):  client.begin_selective_restore(folder_url, sas_token, key_name)  # after:  client.begin_restore(folder_url, sas_token, key_name=key_name)  ```- Removed `KeyVaultBackupClient.get_backup_status` and `.get_restore_status`. Use  the pollers returned by `KeyVaultBackupClient.begin_backup` and `.begin_restore`  to check whether an operation has completed- `KeyVaultRoleAssignment`'s `principal_id`, `role_definition_id`, and `scope`  are now properties of a `properties` property  ```  # before (4.0.0b3):  print(KeyVaultRoleAssignment.scope)  # after:  print(KeyVaultRoleAssignment.properties.scope)  ```- Renamed `KeyVaultPermission` properties:  - `allowed_actions` -&gt; `actions`  - `denied_actions` -&gt; `not_actions`  - `allowed_data_actions` -&gt; `data_actions`  - `denied_data_actions` -&gt; `denied_data_actions`- Renamed argument `role_assignment_name` to `name` in  `KeyVaultAccessControlClient.create_role_assignment`, `.delete_role_assignment`,  and `.get_role_assignment`- Renamed argument `role_definition_name` to `name` in  `KeyVaultAccessControlClient.delete_role_definition` and `.get_role_definition`- Renamed argument `role_scope` to `scope` in `KeyVaultAccessControlClient` methods## 4.0.0b3 (2021-02-09)### Added- `KeyVaultAccessControlClient` supports managing custom role definitions### Breaking Changes- Renamed `KeyVaultBackupClient.begin_full_backup()` to `.begin_backup()`- Renamed `KeyVaultBackupClient.begin_full_restore()` to `.begin_restore()`- Renamed `BackupOperation.azure_storage_blob_container_uri` to `.folder_url`- Renamed `id` property of `BackupOperation`, `RestoreOperation`, and `SelectiveKeyRestoreOperation` to `job_id`- Renamed `blob_storage_uri` parameters of `KeyVaultBackupClient.begin_restore()`  and `.begin_selective_restore()` to `folder_url`- Removed redundant `folder_name` parameter from  `KeyVaultBackupClient.begin_restore()` and `.begin_selective_restore()` (the  `folder_url` parameter contains the folder name)- Renamed `KeyVaultPermission` attributes:  - `actions` -&gt; `allowed_actions`  - `data_actions` -&gt; `allowed_data_actions`  - `not_actions` -&gt; `denied_actions`  - `not_data_actions` -&gt; `denied_data_actions`- Renamed `KeyVaultRoleAssignment.assignment_id` to `.role_assignment_id`- Renamed `KeyVaultRoleScope` enum values:  - `global_value` -&gt; `GLOBAL`  - `keys_value` -&gt; `KEYS`## 4.0.0b2 (2020-10-06)### Added- `KeyVaultBackupClient.get_backup_status` and `.get_restore_status` enable  checking the status of a pending operation by its job ID  ([#13718](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/13718))### Breaking Changes- The `role_assignment_name` parameter of  `KeyVaultAccessControlClient.create_role_assignment` is now an optional  keyword-only argument. When this argument isn't passed, the client will  generate a name for the role assignment.  ([#13512](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/13512))## 4.0.0b1 (2020-09-08)### Added- `KeyVaultAccessControlClient` performs role-based access control operations- `KeyVaultBackupClient` performs full vault backup and full and selective  restore operations</longdescription>

The Degree Days.net API is used by numerous software systems doing automated analysis of energy-usage data from buildings around the world.For more on this Python library, please visit the quick-start guide at [www.degreedays.net/api/python](https://www.degreedays.net/api/python)For more on the Degree Days.net API, please visit [www.degreedays.net/api/](https://www.degreedays.net/api/)For more on degree days and how best to use them, please visit [www.degreedays.net](https://www.degreedays.net/)This client library will run on Python 2 (2.5 and above) and Python 3.  It has zero dependencies.  For development you can use it with the free test API account described at [www.degreedays.net/api/test](https://www.degreedays.net/api/test) but for production use you'll need a commercial Degree Days.net API account from [www.degreedays.net/api/signup](https://www.degreedays.net/api/signup)The quick-start guide at [www.degreedays.net/api/python](https://www.degreedays.net/api/python) will probably be enough to get you going, but please feel free to email us if you'd like any help or if you have any feedback.

Population figures are read from a JSON file into Python dictionaries at import time. The API then only exposes the dictionaries.**The given figures are estimates at best.** Read below for more details on the data source.## InterfaceThe API is formed by 3 functions:* `get_population_a2`: population for a 2-letter country code* `get_population_a3`: population for a 3-letter country code* `get_population`: population for either a 2-letter or a 3-letter country codeAll functions return `None` if no country is found for the given country code. **Lookup is case insensitive**, i.e. `&quot;DE&quot;` and `&quot;de&quot;` give same results.Lookups using country names are difficult &amp; not currently supported, but the source JSON file does contain them. This is to make the source file more comprehensible. If all you have to work with is a country name, consider using [`pycountry`](https://pypi.org/project/pycountry/) to resolve your names to ISO 3166 codes first.If you would like to build your own wrapper around the source JSON, you can do:```pythoncountries: t.List[t.Dict] = pypopulation._load_file()```## InstallationWith `pip` from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/):```pip install pypopulation```## DevelopmentI'm using [`Poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) to maintain development dependencies. These dependencies are only used to assure code quality. They are not necessary to use the package, and are not installed in a production environment.Replicate the development environment:```poetry install```Run lint, tests and produce a `.coverage` file:```poetry run flake8poetry run coverage run -m unittest```These commands run in CI (GH Actions) on pull requests against `master`. Tests are ran on all supported Python versions. Refer to the [`Checks`](.github/workflows/checks.yml) workflow for more information. New releases trigger the [`Publish`](.github/workflows/publish.yml) workflow, which builds a distribution and pushes it to PyPI.## Data sourceThe population figures were sourced from [The World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL) (`2020-07-01`). This dataset provides the country name, alpha-3 code, and population figures found in the resource JSON file. The data was enriched with alpha-2 country codes for each row. Rows not corresponding to political countries were removed, e.g. &quot;Middle East &amp; North Africa (excluding high income)&quot;. Some country names were adjusted for readability, e.g. expanded abbreviations. **No adjustments were made to the population figures**. Please refer to the linked page for a more detailed description of the dataset.This projects aims to expose the linked data to Python code. It does not guarantee correctness of the provided figures.</longdescription>

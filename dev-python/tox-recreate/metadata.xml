But what about your package's requirements inthe `install_requires` setting in `setup.cfg`? If those change tox won'tautomatically recreate the venv, you're expected to run `tox --recreate`yourself.tox-recreate keeps track of the hash of your `setup.cfg` file and triggers toxto recreate your venvs if it changes.## Setting up Your tox-recreate Development EnvironmentFirst you'll need to install:* [Git](https://git-scm.com/).  On Ubuntu: `sudo apt install git`, on macOS: `brew install git`.* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).  This is probably already installed, run `make --version` to check.* [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).  Follow the instructions in pyenv's README to install it.  The **Homebrew** method works best on macOS.  The **Basic GitHub Checkout** method works best on Ubuntu.  You _don't_ need to set up pyenv's shell integration (&quot;shims&quot;), you can  [use pyenv without shims](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#using-pyenv-without-shims).Then to set up your development environment:```terminalgit clone https://github.com/hypothesis/tox-recreate.gitcd tox_recreatemake help```## Releasing a New Version of the Project1. First, to get PyPI publishing working you need to go to:   &lt;https://github.com/organizations/hypothesis/settings/secrets/actions/PYPI_TOKEN&gt;   and add tox-recreate to the `PYPI_TOKEN` secret's selected   repositories.2. Now that the tox-recreate project has access to the `PYPI_TOKEN` secret   you can release a new version by just [creating a new GitHub release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository).   Publishing a new GitHub release will automatically trigger   [a GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/pypi.yml)   that will build the new version of your Python package and upload it to   &lt;https://pypi.org/project/tox-recreate&gt;.## Changing the Project's Python VersionsTo change what versions of Python the project uses:1. Change the Python versions in the   [cookiecutter.json](.cookiecutter/cookiecutter.json) file. For example:   ```json   &quot;python_versions&quot;: &quot;3.10.4, 3.9.12&quot;,   ```2. Re-run the cookiecutter template:   ```terminal   make template   ```3. Commit everything to git and send a pull request## Changing the Project's Python DependenciesTo change the production dependencies in the `setup.cfg` file:1. Change the dependencies in the [`.cookiecutter/includes/setuptools/install_requires`](.cookiecutter/includes/setuptools/install_requires) file.   If this file doesn't exist yet create it and add some dependencies to it.   For example:   ```   pyramid   sqlalchemy   celery   ```2. Re-run the cookiecutter template:   ```terminal   make template   ```3. Commit everything to git and send a pull requestTo change the project's formatting, linting and test dependencies:1. Change the dependencies in the [`.cookiecutter/includes/tox/deps`](.cookiecutter/includes/tox/deps) file.   If this file doesn't exist yet create it and add some dependencies to it.   Use tox's [factor-conditional settings](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/config.html#factors-and-factor-conditional-settings)   to limit which environment(s) each dependency is used in.   For example:   ```   lint: flake8,   format: autopep8,   lint,tests: pytest-faker,   ```2. Re-run the cookiecutter template:   ```terminal   make template   ```3. Commit everything to git and send a pull requestTesting Manually----------------To test it manually you can install your local development copy of`tox-recreate` into the local development environment of another tox-usingproject such as[cookiecutter-pypackage-test](https://github.com/hypothesis/cookiecutter-pypackage-test):1. Install a local development copy of `cookiecutter-pypackage-test` in a temporary directory:   ```terminal   git clone https://github.com/hypothesis/cookiecutter-pypackage-test.git /tmp/cookiecutter-pypackage-test   ```2. Run `cookiecutter-pypackage-test`'s `make sure` command to make sure that   everything is working and to trigger tox to create its `.tox/.tox`   venv:   ```terminal   make --directory &quot;/tmp/cookiecutter-pypackage-test&quot; sure   ```3. Uninstall the production copy of `tox-recreate` from `cookiecutter-pypackage-test`'s `.tox/.tox` venv:   ```terminal   /tmp/cookiecutter-pypackage-test/.tox/.tox/bin/pip uninstall tox-recreate   ```4. Install your local development copy of tox-recreate into `cookiecutter-pypackage-test`'s `.tox/.tox` venv:   ```terminal   /tmp/cookiecutter-pypackage-test/.tox/.tox/bin/pip install -e .   ```5. Now `cookiecutter-pypackage-test` commands will use your local development copy of `tox-recreate`:   ```terminal   make --directory &quot;/tmp/cookiecutter-pypackage-test&quot; test   ```</longdescription>

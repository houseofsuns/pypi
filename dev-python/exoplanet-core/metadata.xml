Most users probably won't install orinteract with `exoplanet-core` directly, instead using it via[exoplanet](https://docs.exoplanet.codes) itself. However, there are a fewreasons why you might be here:1. You want to evaluate a quadratically limb darkened light curve or solve   Kepler's equation in numpy, JAX, or PyMC3, using fast and well-tested code.2. You might have found an issue with one of the compiled ops for `exoplanet`   and want to [report](https://github.com/exoplanet-dev/exoplanet-core/issues)   or [fix](https://github.com/exoplanet-dev/exoplanet-core/pulls) it.3. You might be looking to build a better alternative to `exoplanet`.All of these are excellent reasons to be here, so welcome!## MotivationThis library is developed separately from the `exoplanet` codebase for severalreasons, but the main one is that the code in this repo needs to change at aless frequent cadence than the main exoplanet modeling code and there is somecost associated with re-compiling the backend. I'm hoping that this separationwill make it easier for people to contribute to the exoplanet project withoutdealing with compilation issues. This also means that some users can use justthe computational components here without the heavy dependencies required by theexoplanet project. This might be useful, for example, for people who just want ahigh performance solver for Kepler's equation or fast quadraticallylimb-darkened light curves.## InstallationThe best way to install `exoplanet-core` is using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io):```bashpython -m pip install exoplanet-core```By default this will only install the `numpy` ops and its dependencies (only`numpy` itself). So if you want to install the dependencies for the `jax` or`pymc` versions, you can run:```bashpython -m pip install &quot;exoplanet-core[jax]&quot;# orpython -m pip install &quot;exoplanet-core[pymc]&quot;```You can also install `exoplanet-core` using [conda](https://docs.conda.io) from`conda-forge`:```bashconda install -c conda-forge exoplanet-core```## UsageIf you're developing new ops or fixing existing ones, you'll probably want toskip to the next section, but if you just want to solve Kepler's equation orcompute a limb darkened light curve, you can use the following snippets.To solve Kepler's equation and compute the true anomaly for an array ofeccentricities:```pythonfrom exoplanet_core import keplerecc = 0.3M = # compute the mean anomaly as a function of time for your measurementssinf, cosf = kepler(M, ecc)# Use the true anomaly to evaluate your model```To compute the relative flux for a quadratically limb darkened light curve atsome projected center-to-center distance `b` and radius ratio `ror`:```pythonfrom exoplanet_core import quad_limbdark_light_curveu1, u2 = 0.3, 0.2ror = 0.05b = # Compute the impact parameter as a function of timeflux = quad_limbdark_light_curve(u1, u2, b, ror)```where `u1` and `u2` are the usual limb darkening parameters and the resultingflux is in relative units where `0` is the unocculted flux. Some otherimplementations that you might be familiar with return this value plus one.## API Reference`exoplanet-core` currently provides three ops, but only two are intended forgeneral consumption: `kepler` and `quad_solution_vector`. The three interfaces(`numpy`, `jax`, and `pymc`) are designed to have the same API, so you canimport them interchangeably as:```pythonfrom exoplanet_core.{interface} import ops```where `{interface}` is `numpy`, `jax`, or `pymc`.#### `kepler````pythonsin_true_anomaly, cos_true_anomaly = ops.kepler(mean_anomaly, eccentricity)```Solve Kepler's equation and convert to the true anomaly using a fast method(Brandt et al., in prep) that gives nearly machine precision across the fullvalid parameter range.| Parameter      | Type    | Description                             || :------------- | :------ | :-------------------------------------- || `mean_anomaly` | `array` | This does not need to be range reduced. || `eccentricity` | `array` | Must be in the range `[0, 1)`.          || Returns            | Type    | Description                             || :----------------- | :------ | :-------------------------------------- || `sin_true_anomaly` | `array` | The sine and cosine of the true anomaly || `cos_true_anomaly` | `array` | evaluated at the input coordinates.     |#### `quad_solution_vector````pythonsoln = ops.quad_solution_vector(impact_parameter, radius_ratio)```Compute the &quot;solution vector&quot; as defined by [Agol et al.(2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03222) for a quadratically limb darkenedlight curve.

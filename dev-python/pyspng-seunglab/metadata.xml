	<longdescription>[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/pyspng-seunglab.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/pyspng-seunglab)**Note:** This is a fork of pyspng which can be found here: https://github.com/nurpax/pyspng/. See below for a list of differences.**Pyspng** is a small library to for efficiently loading PNG files to numpy arrays.Pyspng does not offer any image manipulation functionality.Pyspng was originally written to speed up loading uncompressed (PNG compression level 0),making the PNG file format more suitable to be used in machine learning datasets.  Pyspnguses the native [libspng](https://github.com/randy408/libspng) library for fast PNGdecoding.  Synthetic benchmarks indicate pyspng to be roughly 2-3x faster inloading uncompressed PNGs than the Python Pillow library.## Scripting Example```pythonimport numpy as npimport pyspngfrom pyspng import ProgressiveMode# DECODINGwith open('test.png', 'rb') as fin:    nparr = pyspng.load(fin.read())# ENCODINGbinary = pyspng.encode(    nparr,    # Options: NONE (0), PROGRESSIVE (1), INTERLACED (2)    progressive=ProgressiveMode.PROGRESSIVE,     compress_level=6)with open('test.png', 'wb') as fout:    fout.write(binary)```## CLI ExampleThere is a CLI included with this distribution.```bash# turn a numpy file into a highly compressed progressive PNGpyspng example.npy --level 9 --progressive # -&gt; example.png# create a highly compressed progressive interlaced PNGpyspng example.npy --level 9 --interlaced # -&gt; example.png# convert a PNG into a numpy file example.npypyspng -d example.png # read headerpyspng --header example.png```## Installation```bashpip install pyspng-seunglab```Binary wheels are built for Linux, MacOS, and Windows. This library is intended to be a drop-in replacement for pyspng, so simultaneous installations are not possible. If this is inconvinient, we can adjust this.## Differences from pyspng1. Compiles on MacOS2. Upgrades spng to 0.7.23. Fixes a bug for decoding grayscale with alpha4. Adds an encoder function (new in libspng)5. Replaces zlib with miniz-2.2.0 for simplicity.6. Adds CLI for compressing/decompressing npy files.7. Adds function for examining PNG headers.## Licensepyspng and pyspng-seunglab are provided under a BSD-style license that can be found in the LICENSE file.

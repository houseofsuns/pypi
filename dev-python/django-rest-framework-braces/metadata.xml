Name inspired by `django-braces &lt;https://github.com/brack3t/django-braces&gt;`_.* Free software: MIT license* GitHub: https://github.com/dealertrack/django-rest-framework-braces* Documentation: https://django-rest-framework-braces.readthedocs.io.Installing----------Easiest way to install ``django-rest-framework-braces`` is by using ``pip``::    $ pip install django-rest-framework-bracesUsage-----Once installed, you can use any of the supplied utilities by simply importing them.For example::    from drf_braces.mixins import MultipleSerializersViewMixin    class MyViewSet(MultipleSerializersViewMixin, GenericViewSet):        def create(self, request):            serializer = self.get_serializer(serializer_class=MySerializer)            ...For full list of available utilities, please refer to the `documentation &lt;https://django-rest-framework-braces.readthedocs.io&gt;`_.Testing-------To run the tests you need to install testing requirements first::    $ make installThen to run tests, you can use use Makefile command::    $ make testHistory-------0.3.4 (2019-02-25)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Added ``EnforceValidationFieldMixin.capture_failed_field``, ``FormSerializerFieldMixin.capture_failed_field``,  and ``FormSerializerBase.capture_failed_fields`` to capture the optional fields that failed.0.3.3 (2019-02-21)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Fixing invalid data being copied over in ``FormSerializer`` when fail mode is not ``fail``0.3.2 (2018-11-21)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Fixing ``DoubleAsStrJsonEncoder`` by subclassing from DRF which supports datetimes, etc0.3.1 (2018-11-07)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Fixing ``SwappingSerializerMixin`` by supporting ``ListSerializer``0.3.0 (2018-11-05)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Added ``SwappingSerializerMixin``.  Allows to declaratively swap fields any field instances in child serializers.* Added ``DoubleAsStrJsonEncoder`` for handicapped API clients.0.2.3 (2017-10-18)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Fixed how choices are normalized in ``SerializerForm`` to ``[(key, key)]``  vs previously ``[(key, value)]`` to match DRF's handling of choices unlike Django forms.* Added support for ``Form.all_fields`` and ``Form.all_base_fields``  in ``SerializerForm`` which supports custom form classes which implement such API.* Added support for ``FormSerializer.Meta.exclude`` which allows to specify fields to exclude.0.2.2 (2017-05-09)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Added ``rounding`` parameter to ``RoundedDecimalField`` which allows to define rounding direction  when rounding value.0.2.1 (2017-04-27)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Fixed bugs in ``RoundedDecimalField``0.2.0 (2017-04-25)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Added ``RoundedDecimalField`` for rounding off decimal to specified ``decimal_places``  instead of validing that higher precision is not allowed* Added ``URLField`` for automatic mapping between django forms and DRF serializers0.1.6 (2016-02-29)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Fixed a bug in ``SerializerForm`` in which form cleaned data was replaced with serializer data  instead of updating it.0.1.5 (2015-07-15)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Fixed a bug in ``EnforceValidationFieldMixin`` that it was overwriting ``to_internal_value`` instead of ``run_validation``0.1.4 (2015-07-13)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Test coverage is now at 100%!0.1.3 (2015-07-10)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Fixed bugs in ``AllowBlankNullFieldMixin``* All DRF fields not subclass both ``AllowBlankNullFieldMixin`` and ``EmptyStringFieldMixin``0.1.2 (2015-07-02)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Added custom ``to_representation()`` to ``EmptyStringFieldMixin`` which allows to pass empty string or ``None`` values.  This is especially useful for fields like ``IntegerField`` which would blow up when passing empty string value for non-required fields.0.1.1 (2015-06-25)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Fixed a bug in ``FormSerializer`` which did not honor ``field_mapping`` in any of the subclasses0.1.0 (2015-06-15)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* First release on PyPI.Credits-------Development Lead~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Mike Waters - https://github.com/mikewaters* Miroslav Shubernetskiy - https://github.com/miki725Contributors~~~~~~~~~~~~* Khaled Porlin - https://github.com/porlin72* Agam Dua - https://github.com/agamdua* Marc Marta - https://github.com/mmarta* ClairePhila - https://github.com/ClairePhila* Ndubisi Onuora - https://github.com/NdubisiOnuoraLicense-------::    The MIT License (MIT)    Copyright (c) 2015, dealertrack technologies    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy    of this software and associated documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to deal    in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights    to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell    copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is    furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:    The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in    all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

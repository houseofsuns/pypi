Just make sure to upgrade pip using,```shpython3 -m pip install --upgrade pip```### Installing cowboe ###cowboe is available on pypi and can be installed using pip as follows,```shpip install cowboe```### Building from source ###Download the source as a zip file from GitHub and extract the files to a new folder. Before building cowboe install the dependencies using pip as shown below and it will resolve all dependencies conflicts.```shcd &lt;location of extracted files with setup.py file&gt;pip3 install numpy scipy matplotlib seaborn shapely imageio pandaspython setup.py install```After the installation cowboe module should be available and it can be checked by using,```shpython -c &quot;import cowboe&quot;```Any error means cowboe was not installed sucessfully. ## Usagecowboe has different functions which perform individual task like running the cowboe algorithm, performing NM optimization, visualization of the pmf curves and summarizing the NM steps. A detailed explanation and examples with the required data files are provided in the examples directory. A simple but comprehensive example is shown below,```shfrom cowboe import pmftopoints, cowboe, cowboefit, settings_updatefrom cowboe import cowboeKS, cowboeRNM, cowboeNM, progressfile, NMprogress, cowboe3Dsurfacefrom cowboe import cowboe_wham, pmfcompare, multi_pmfcompare, cowboe_settings, wham_settingsfrom cowboe import cowboe_trajcut, cowboe_OVL, cowboe_pmfplot, pmfdiffimport numpy as npimport osimport warnings os.chdir('location of the examples folder')# uncomment the below two lines if you donot want to see the plot while running from commandline# matplotlib.use('Agg')# warnings.filterwarnings(&quot;ignore&quot;)# to update the cowboe_setting dictionary.cowboe_settings.update({&quot;param B&quot; : 2.0})# to convert the rest pmf into array for further processing.'''The below function generates a pickle file called variable.pkl and it will be used for further steps'''pmftopoints(location=os.path.join(loc,'testpmf'),\            testpmf='test_pmf.txt',\            order=12);# algorithm to get window distribution of the given parameters based on the test pmf data.'''for the initial guess from pmftopoints() the below function runs the cowboe algorithm to itertivelyconstruct windows and generates the samplingtime and forceconstant for each window in order to perform MD runs.''''''Here sc in the below function is the sampling considered in terms of nshere 8ns corresponds to 8ns/window for a total of n number of windowsThe defaults values like the conventional number of windows etc are used to calculate how much computations the user would have used through the conventionalroutine.And these and other values can be adjusted using dict updatee.g. cowboe_settings.update({&quot;ylim&quot; : (0,16)})'''cowboe(A=3.5000, \         B=2.0, \             V =0.8000 ,\                 sc =8,\                     name='3',\                         subtype='100mc',\                             location=loc+'/temppmf',\                                 equal_sampling=True);                                 # calculates PMF using wham for the given trajectories # must update list.txt which is the metadata file for the wham calculation.# more information on the tool is available here,'''Grossfield, Alan, “WHAM: the weighted histogram analysis method”, version 2.0.10, http://membrane.urmc.rochester.edu/wordpress/?page_id=126''''''All trajectory files must be given a '.traj' extensionlist.txt file should also be present for identifying the trajectory files.This file is same as the metadata file described in the wham documentation,http://membrane.urmc.rochester.edu/wordpress/?page_id=126'''# To update the wham_setting dictionary.

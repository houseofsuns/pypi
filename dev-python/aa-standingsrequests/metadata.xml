Standings Requests is a plugin for Alliance Auth. If you don't have Alliance Auth running already, please install it first before proceeding. (see the official [AA installation guide](https://allianceauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/auth/allianceauth/) for details)2. Standings Requests needs the app [django-eveuniverse](https://gitlab.com/ErikKalkoken/django-eveuniverse) to function. Please make sure it is installed, before before continuing.### Step 2 - Update Eve Online scopesAdd the following scopes to the Eve Online app used by Auth on [developers.eveonline.com](https://developers.eveonline.com/):```plainesi-alliances.read_contacts.v1esi-corporations.read_contacts.v1```### Step 3 - Python installationActivate your virtual environment and install this app with:```bashpip install aa-standingsrequests```### Step 4 - Django InstallationAdd `'standingsrequests'` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in your Alliance Auth local settings file. Also add the other settings from the [Settings Example](#settings-example) and update the example config for your alliance.The most important part of the settings is `STANDINGS_API_CHARID`, which need to be the Eve Online ID of the character that will be used to sync standings with your alliance or corporation.Run database migrations:```bashpython manage.py migrate standingsrequests```Copy static files to your webserver:```bashpython manage.py collectstatic```Finally restart Django and Celery.### Step 5 - Setup app within AuthOpen the standingsrequests app in Alliance Auth and add the token for the configured standings character. This will initiate the first pull of standings. You will get a notification once the standings pull is completed (Usually within a few minutes).Last, but not least make sure to add [permissions](#permissions) to groups / states as required to make the new app available to users.That's it, you should be ready to roll.## Settings ExampleHere is a complete example of all settings that goes into your local settings file.```Python# id of character to use for updating alliance contactsSTANDINGS_API_CHARID = 1234STR_CORP_IDS = [CORP1ID, CORP2ID, ...]STR_ALLIANCE_IDS = [YOUR_ALLIANCE_ID, ...]# This is a map, where the key is the State the user is in# and the value is a list of required scopes to checkSR_REQUIRED_SCOPES = {    'Member': ['publicData'],    'Blue': [],    '': []  # no state}# CELERY tasksCELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE['standings_requests_standings_update'] = {    'task': 'standings_requests.standings_update',    'schedule': crontab(minute='*/30'),}CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE['standings_requests_update_associations_api'] = {    'task': 'standings_requests.update_associations_api',    'schedule': crontab(minute='30', hour='*/3'),}CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE['standings_requests_validate_requests'] = {    'task': 'standings_requests.validate_requests',    'schedule': crontab(minute='0', hour='*/6'),}CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE['standings_requests_purge_stale_data'] = {    'task': 'standings_requests.purge_stale_data',    'schedule': crontab(minute='0', hour='*/24'),}```## SettingsHere is a brief explanation of all available settings:Name | Description | Default-- | -- | --`SR_CORPORATIONS_ENABLED` | switch to enable/disable ability to request standings for corporations | `True``SR_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED` | Send notifications to users about the results of standings requests and standing changes of their characters | `True``SR_OPERATION_MODE` | Select the entity type of your standings master. Can be: `&quot;alliance&quot;` or `&quot;corporation&quot;` | `&quot;alliance&quot;``SR_REQUIRED_SCOPES` | map of required scopes per state (Mandatory, can be [] per state) | -`SR_PAGE_CACHE_SECONDS` | Number of seconds to cache heavy pages like character and groups standing. Set to 0 to disable. | `600``SR_STANDINGS_STALE_HOURS` | Standing data will be considered stale and removed from the local database after the configured hours. The latest standings data will never be purged, no matter how old it is | `48``SR_STANDING_TIMEOUT_HOURS` | Max hours to wait for a standing to be effective after being marked actioned. Non effective standing requests will be reset when this timeout expires. | `24``SR_SYNC_BLUE_ALTS_ENABLED` | Automatically sync standing of alts known to Auth that have standing in game  | `True``STANDINGS_API_CHARID` | Eve Online ID of character to use for fetching alliance contacts from ESI (Mandatory) | -`STR_ALLIANCE_IDS` | Eve Online ID of alliances. Characters belonging to one of those alliances are considered &quot;in organization&quot;. Your main alliance goes here when in alliance mode. (Mandatory, can be []) | -`STR_CORP_IDS` | Eve Online ID of corporations. Characters belonging to one of those corporations are considered &quot;in organization&quot;. Your main corporation goes here when in corporation mode. (Mandatory, can be []) | -## PermissionsThese are all relevant permissions:Name | Description-- | --*abstract standings request - User can request standings* | This is the permission required to have basic access to this app and be able to request and maintain blue standings without them being revoked. IMPORTANT: When a user no longer has this permission all of their standings will be revoked.*contact set - User can view standings* | See which mains the character and corporation standing have been requested by. Typically you'll probably only want standings managers to have this.*abstract standings request - User can process standings requests* | User can see standings requests and process/approve/reject them.*contact set - User can export standing requests* | User can download all of the standings data, including main character associations, as a CSV file. Useful if you want to do some extra fancy processing in a spreadsheet or something.## Standings RequirementsThese are the requirements to be able to request and maintain blue standings. If a character or account falls out of these requirement scopes then their standing(s) will be revoked.Request Type | Requirements-- | --Character | • Character has been added to Auth and is owned by the requesting user.&lt;br&gt; • User has the `request_standings` permissions.Corporation | • All member characters of the corporation have been added to Auth and are owned by the requesting user&lt;br&gt;• User has the `request_standings` permission.Note that all characters need to maintain valid tokens in Auth or there standing will automatically be revoked.## Manual for Standing ManagersStanding managers have the ability to review standings requests on the &quot;Manage Requests&quot; page.### Standings RequestsStandings Requests are fairly straightforward, there are two options:#### RejectReject the standings request, effectively deleting it. The user will be able to request it again however.#### ActionedThe requested standing has been actioned/changed in game. The system then expects to see this request become effective within 24 hours. If it does not show up in a standings API pull within 24 hours the actioned flag is removed and it will show up as a standings request again.Once a standing is actioned it will be maintained as an &quot;effective&quot; standings request. If the standing is removed in game while it is still valid in the system then it will become an active request again.### Standings RevocationsStandings will show up here in one of two situations:1. The user has deleted the standings request for that contact, indicating they no longer require the standing.2. The user is no longer eligible to hold active standings.Currently it is not indicated which of these two cases (or which automatic revocation case) triggered the standing revocation.#### DeleteMake sure you fully understand delete before using it, you will usually use one of the other two options instead of delete. When you delete a standings request *it is literally deleted*. The system will no longer attempt to manage this request or verify that it has been revoked etc. *The standing becomes &quot;unmanaged&quot;*.#### UndoTurns the standing revocation into a standings request again. Useful if someone got booted from corp or auth temporarily. If they still don't have the requirements met the next time a validation pass happens then it will be turned into a revocation again.#### ActionedSame as for Standings Requests. The system will hold the revocation in the background until it sees it removed in game. If the standing has still not been unset (or set to neutral or below) in 24 hours then it will appear as a standings revocation again.## Management CommandsThis app comes with management commands that provide special features for admins.You can run any management command from the command. Make sure you are in the folder that also contains `manage.py` and that you have activate your venv:```bashpython manage.py NAME_OF_COMMAND```### `standingsrequests_sync_blue_alts`This command automatically creates accepted standing requests for alt characters on Auth that already have blue standing in game. This can be useful when this app is first installed to avoid having all users manually request standing for alts that are already blue.Standings created by this command will not have an actioner name set.## HistoryThis is a fork of [Basraah's standingrequests](https://gitlab.com/ErikKalkoken/aa-standingsrequests).Big thanks to Basraah for all his effort in developing the initial version.</longdescription>

For this it provides the backend `APIBackend` to evaluate qoqo quantum programs and the `api_devices` module to represent devices available on the emulators.### QRydDemo specific hardware operations (prototype)Rydberg atom based quantum devices support, in principle, operations not commonly found in other quantum hardware. Changes in device topology are one of these operations. qoqo-qryd adds support for changes in device topology to qoqo via the operations in its `pragma_operations` module.Note that this is a preview prototype and does not represent a finalized set of operations on the QRydDemo hardware.### Local simulator supporting specific hardware operationsqoqo-qryd includes a local [QuEST](https://github.com/QuEST-Kit/QuEST) based simulator for quantum devices supporting the Rydberg specific quantum operations. The simulator is intended to let users test the capabilities of quantum hardware with the additional operations.qoqo-qryd provides the simulator via the `SimulatorBackend` qoqo-compatible backend that uses the device prototypes in its `qryd_devices` module.Note that the devices for the simulator do not represent a finalized design for QRydDemo.## Accessing QRydDemo WebAPITo use the WebAPI, a QRydDemo account is required. Users can register via the [online registration form](https://thequantumlaend.de/get-access/).## InstallationThe `qoqo-qryd` package is available on PyPi as a source distribution and as precompiled wheels for linux and macOS on the x86 platform. Other platforms need to install from the source distribution.For both source distribution and pre-built wheels it can be installed via```shellpip install qoqo-qryd```When building from source `qoqo-qryd` requires rust, [maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin) and cmake to be installed locally. We recommend using [rustup](https://rustup.rs) to set up a rust toolchain. The pip command should also automatically install maturin to build a python package locally and install it.For a quick installation of the dependencies you can also use:```shellcurl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | shpip install maturin```## DocumentationThe [user documentation](https://hqsquantumsimulations.github.io/qoqo_qryd/) is provided on github pages.The API-documentation for qoqo-qryd can be found as an appendix of the user documentation.## ExamplesA small collection of [example python scripts](https://github.com/HQSquantumsimulations/qoqo_qryd/tree/main/qoqo-qryd/examples) for the QRydDemo project can be found in the project github repository. The examples include* `howto_webapi_qoqo.ipynb` provides an example accessing the QRydDemo's emulator with qoqo.* `switch_layout_example.py` shows how to construct a QRydDemo device and using the PragmaChangeQrydLayout operation to switch between layouts in a quantum Circuit.* `shift_qubits_example.py` shows how to construct a QRydDemo device and using the PragmaShiftQrydQubit operation to shift qubits between tweezer positions in a quantum Circuit.* `multi_qubit_example.py` shows how to use multi-qubit-operations.* `serialisation_example.py` demonstrates how to serialize a QuantumProgram to JSON format.## OpenSSLAcknowledgments related to using OpenSSL for http requests:&quot;This product includes software developed by the OpenSSL Projectfor use in the OpenSSL Toolkit (http://www.openssl.org/).&quot;This product includes cryptographic software written by Eric Young(eay@cryptsoft.com).

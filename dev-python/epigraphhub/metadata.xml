In fact, all applications designed to run on the EpiGraphHub platform rely heavily on it.This library should be used by users that want to contribute to the platform as well as by users that want to borrow some of the tools developed by our team in other opensource projects.EpiGraphHub library allows users make and apply:- Bayesian Statistics- Epidemiological analysis- Mathematical modelling- Cost-effectiveness analysis- Forecasting- Machine Learning- Text Mining- Geo-Spatial analysisThe EpiGraphHub library is also available for the [R](https://github.com/thegraphnetwork/r-epigraphhub/blob/main/epigraphhub.Rproj) language.## InstallationThe EpigraphHub library can be installed using pip:```$ pip install epigraphhub```## UsageView Example EpiGraphHub Applications in Our Documentation:- [Downloading Google Trends Data (Python version)](https://epigraphhub-libraries.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data/trends.html#downloading-google-trends-data-python-version)- [Fetching Raster data from WorldPop](https://epigraphhub-libraries.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data/worldpop.html)- [Downloading data from World Bank Data](https://epigraphhub-libraries.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data/worldbank.html)- [Epidemiological Data Analysis](https://epigraphhub-libraries.readthedocs.io/en/latest/analysis/index.html)## DocumentationThe official documentation is hosted on [ReadtheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/epigraphhub-libraries/).Check our [website](https://www.epigraphhub.org/) for most details about the EpiGraphHub project.## How to contributeIf you want to contribute to EpiGraphHub, check our [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/thegraphnetwork/epigraphhub_py/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).## Code of conductCheck our [Code of conduct](https://github.com/thegraphnetwork/epigraphhub_py/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).## 📈 ReleasesYou can see the list of available releases on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/thegraphnetwork/epigraphhub_py/releases) page.## 🛡 License[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/thegraphnetwork/epigraphhub_py)](https://github.com/thegraphnetwork/epigraphhub_py/blob/master/LICENSE)This project is licensed under the terms of the `GNU GPL v3.0` license.

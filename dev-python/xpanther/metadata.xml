If it doesn't show up (happens in pycharm sometimes), go to global site-packages (`pip show xpanther`&lt;--cmd command to find directory), find and copy xpanther package, and paste it to your project's venv._## This package contains 2 modules, `XPanther` and `XPantherIDE`, let's start with the powerhouse!Import XPanther to your file like:  ```pythonfrom xpanther import XPanther```## How to use:#### Insert inside **_XPanther()_** the whole **HTML/XML** text, which can be in the form of:- **string**, - the **path** to any local text file you might have or - a page **url** (check below for optional-parameter page_url).#### Insert inside **._capture()_** the **outerHTML/whole** text of element to be found:- as a **string**- or alternatively an **integer**, which represents the index of that element in the DOM, starting from 1 as the first (check below for interesting usage of index input).```pythonXPanther(dom).capture(element)```After writing this , run the code and the **xpath** of that element should be returned as value and printed in the console.#### Code execution illustrations:&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108073687/219906727-07172ca3-b5e9-4170-9538-9d0c777fb4c5.jpg&quot; width=&quot;900&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108073687/219906731-d7215aab-1526-440f-809a-f14c6f3b31ab.jpg&quot; width=&quot;900&quot;&gt;    #### **The class has a few optional-parameters that you can change to modify it in the way you want:**- `xml` (default: `False`): Set this to `True` if document is not HTML, this is because the xml document can contain uppercase characters in attributes, unlike html, so a different parser needs to be used.- `pre_formatted` (default: `False`): Set this to `True` if you have already formatted document and don't want formatter of XPanther to change anything.- `url_input` (default: `False`): Set this to `True` if you intend to insert page url intead of text or file as the dom parameter of this class.- `child_method` (default: `True`): Set this to `False` if you don't want the Xpath to be found using its children, reason for this can depend on context.- `show_all` (default: `False`): Set this to `True` if you want all possible working xpaths found and not resort to only the one chosen by program.- `no_digits` (default: `False`): Set this to `True` if you don't want element attributes that contain numbers.- `print_output` (default: `True`): Set this to `False` if you don't want the program to print anything in console but just return the xpath as a value in any variable or function.- `speed`  (default: `'normal'`): other valid options are `'fast'` -- (less detailed, faster execution), `'slow'` -- (more detailed, slower execution), or an integer (maximum is 50, which represent the number of attributes of element program can take and proccess to find combinations of).          if you have a slow computer, better set it to 'fast', cause it takes lesser number of combination and lowers memory and performance consumption, thus increasing speed of execution.### For most optimal usage, keep this values as default, you have to only change  to xml=True if you are not dealing with HTML, and url_input=True if you like to fetch the HTML directly from link. #### Interesting way which you can utilize putting an integer as parameter to capture(), is this function like here:```pythonfor x in range(100):    XPanther('xpath_test.txt').capture(x+1)```Literally, create and write an unique xpath for every element in the document if you want (change the number in range() accordingly).# If you are into web automation, that's where `XPantherIDE` comes into play.`XPantherIDE` is a simple Selenium script, that tries to mimic an IDE for finding xpaths instantly on any web page with just 1 click.Import:```pythonfrom xpanther import XPantherIDE```Use:```pythonXPantherIDE('page_url').start()```       #### After you run the program, the browser will open, and you can start finding xpaths by `right-clicking` over elements. A pop up alert will appear showing the xpath, you must accept/close the pop up before trying again. You can then just close the browser and the program terminates.#### The program will test each xpath if it works, it is corresponding to clicked element, and output it in the console along with its speed.### **Both programs are open to improvements or new ideas!**</longdescription>

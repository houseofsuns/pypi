	<longdescription># SquaredownWe use Square as our point of sale system for our businesses. It works really well for most applications, but it takes too long to produce reports in a way that meets our business needs and the process is just too manual. We needed an automated way to produce our customized reports either at a click of a button or on a schedule. To do that we download the Square data into a MongoDB database. This is the code that we use to connect Square to MongoDB.## Getting StartedThese instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.### PrerequisitesThis package supports the following version of Python.

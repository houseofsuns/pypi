Note that setting the `core.hooksPath` configuration variable would lead to [pre-commit failing](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/issues/1198). The `commit-msg` hook [runs after](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) the `pre-commit` hook, hence the two are de-coupled in this workflow.To associate a commit with an issue, you will need to reference the JIRA Issue key (For eg 'CIDC-1111') in the corresponding commit message.## Admin functionsUnder the (hidden) `admin` are several functions meant for CIDC administators / engineers.### CSMS```bashcidc admin test-csms```A simple API hit for a test of CSMS connection. Hits API endpoint `/admin/test_csms` which in turn gets CSMS's `/docs`.This tests that the API is able to successfully make connection with the CSMS, as the `/docs` endpoint requires authorization.As the API endpoint is protected, only users with role `cidc-admin` can make this request.### dbedit suiteA set of commands to list / remove data from the database, including shipments, clinical data, and assay/analysis data.It directly uses Google's cloud SDK to make a direct connection to the postgres cloud sql database, so it requires the user has `cloudsql.instances.connect` IAM permission.#### AuthenticationAuthentication uses Application Default Credentials (ADC). Log-in is done via:```bashgcloud auth application-default login```#### ConfigurationConfiguration of the environment ie staging versus production is done as above using:```bashcidc config get-envcidc config set-env ENV```Configuration of the database username is done via a pair of functions:```bashcidc admin get-usernamecidc admin set-username USERNAME```The password is requested every time you issue a command so as to not store it.#### Listing dataUnder the `list` subcommand of `cidc admin`, you can get descriptions of the data available in the database.- `cidc admin list clinical TRIAL_ID`  - prints a table describing all shipments for the given trial  - with the following columns:    - `object_url`, `filename`, `num_participants`, `created`, `comment`- `cidc admin list misc-data TRIAL_ID`  - prints a table describing all misc_data files for the given trial  - with the following columns:    - `batch_id`, `object_url`, `filename`, `created`, `description`- `cidc admin list shipments TRIAL_ID`  - prints a table describing all shipments for the given trial  - with the following columns:    - `upload_type`, `manifest_id`, `num_samples`, `created`- `cidc admin list assay TRIAL_ID ASSAY_OR_ANALYSIS`  - prints a table listing all samples for the given assay/analysis and trial  - any of the following values are allowed:    - `clinical_data`, same as `cidc admin list clinical TRIAL_ID`    - `misc_data`, same as `cidc admin list misc-data TRIAL_ID`    - analyses: `atacseq_analysis`, `ctdna_analysis`, `cytof_analysis`, `microbiome_analysis`, `rna_level1_analysis`, `tcr_analysis`, `wes_analysis`, `wes_analysis_old`, `wes_tumor_only_analysis`, `wes_tumor_only_analysis_old`    - assays: `atacseq`, `ctdna`, `cytof`, `hande`, `ihc`, `elisa`, `microbiome`, `mif`, `nanostring`, `olink`, `rna`, `tcr`, `wes`#### Removing dataUnder the `remove` subcommand of `cidc admin`, you can remove a wide variety of data from the JSON blobs.- `cidc admin remove clinical TRIAL_ID TARGET_ID`  - removes a given clinical data file from a given trial's metadata as well as the file itself from the portal  - `TARGET_ID` is the `filename` of the clinical data to remove, as from `cidc admin list clinical TRIAL_ID`    - special value `'*'` for all files for this trial- `cidc admin remove shipment TRIAL_ID TARGET_ID`  - removes a given shipment from a given trial's metadata  - `TARGET_ID` is the `manifest_id` of the shipment to remove, as from `cidc admin list shipments TRIAL_ID`- `cidc admin remove assay TRIAL_ID ASSAY_OR_ANALYSIS TARGET_ID`  - removes a given clinical data file from a given trial's metadata as well as the associated files themselves from the portal  - for `ASSAY_OR_ANALYSIS=clinical_data`, same as `cidc admin remove clinical TRIAL_ID TARGET_ID`  - `TARGET_ID` is a tuple of the ids to find the data to remove, as from `cidc admin list assay TRIAL_ID ASSAY_OR_ANALYSIS`.    - It cannot go past where is divisible in the data, but can end early to remove the whole section.    - Namely:      - `elisa`: requires only `assay_run_id`      - `misc_data`, `olink`: require `batch_id` with an optional `filename`      - `nanostring`: requires `batch_id` and optional `run_id`      - `rna_level1_analysis`, `wes_tumor_only_analysis`,  `wes_tumor_only_analysis_old`: requires only `cimac_id`      - `wes_analysis`, `wes_analysis_old`: requires only `run_id`      - otherwise: requires `batch_id` and optional `cimac_id`</longdescription>

	<longdescription># Shoal Client READMEshoal-client will configure cvmfs to use the closest squid server to you by contacting the shoal serverand using cvmfs-talk to update the active proxy configuration.shoal-client is a simple python script typically configured to run with cron to check for new squids periodically. Before setting the cronjob in place make sure that shoal-client isconfigured correctly (see Usage below).With the release of v0.6.4 the shoal-client now offers support for frontier. Running the shoal-clientwith the --frontier or -f option will produce an output string instead of attempting to update theproxies via cvmfs-talk. See Usage below for more information.## Installation**Note**: Requires Python 2.4+**Note**: Shoal config files will be located either at `~/.shoal/` or `/etc/shoal/` if installed root permissions.### Recommended Instalation Method: Use pip1. `sudo python3 -m pip install shoal-client` or, if using an old python2 version of pip: `pip install shoal-client`2. Copy the configuration file to proper location    ```    # For python3    cp /usr/local/share/shoal-client/shoal_client.conf /etc/shoal/        # For python2    cp /usr/share/shoal-client/shoal_client.conf /etc/shoal/    ````3. Check settings in `shoal_client.conf` update as needed    ## UsageConfirm the that you configured shoal-client as expected by checking the output of `shoal-client --dump`The output is a list of servers that will be set as proxies using cvmfs-talk. For example you will see something like the following:    http://squid.example1.com:3128;http://squid.example2.com:3128;http://squid.example3.com:3128;http://squid.example4.com:3128;http://squid.example5.org:3128;DIRECTIf the output looks resonable now set a crontab entry to run shoal say every 30 minutes:    0,30 * * * * /usr/bin/shoal-clientNew in version 0.6.4 is the --frontier option that will produce an output string suitable for frontier.Users will need to use a simple script that runs shoal-client and uses the output to set the proxies.An example script can be found [here](https://github.com/hep-gc/shoal/blob/master/shoal-client/scripts/frontier_set.sh) in the shoal-client/scripts directory.Example output when running `shoal-client --frontier`:    (serverurl=http://PresetServer.ca:3128)(proxyurl=http://PROXY.FROM.SHOAL.1:3128)(proxyurl=http://PROXY.FROM.SHOAL.2:3128)### Flags and Options| Option | Description || --- | --- || -d or --dump | Print closest proxies to terminal for testing or debugging. || -s `hostname` or --server `hostname`| Specifies URL of the desired shoal-server to contact. Takes precedence over the option in config file. || -n `int` or --squids `int` | Specifies the number of squids to retrieve from the shoal-server. || -f or --frontier | Outputs a string appropriate for use as the frontier proxy enviroment variable instead of using cvmfs-talk to update the active proxy configuration. || -k or --skip-broadcast | Skips waiting to hear from a shoal-agent on the local network and goes directly to the shoal server for a squid. Only reccomended when you know there is no squid//agent on the local network. |Shoal client now uses the cvmfs_talk protocol. To view the list of returned squids issue:     cvmfs_talk proxy info## Other Installation Methods### Using Pip1. `pip install shoal-client`2. Copy the configuration file to proper location    ```    # For python3    cp /usr/local/share/shoal-client/shoal_client.conf /etc/shoal/        # For python2    cp /usr/share/shoal-client/shoal_client.conf /etc/shoal/    ```3. Check settings in `shoal_client.conf` update as needed### Using Git1. `git clone git://github.com/hep-gc/shoal.git`2. `cd shoal/shoal-client/`3. `python setup.py install`4. Copy the configuration file to proper location `cp conf/shoal_client.conf /etc/shoal/`5. Check settings in `shoal_client.conf` update as needed</longdescription>

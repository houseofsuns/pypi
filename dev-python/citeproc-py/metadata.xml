It aims to implement the`CSL 1.0.1 specification`_. citeproc-py can output styled citations andbibliographies in a number of different output formats. Currentlysupported are plain text, reStructuredText and HTML. Other formats canbe added easily.citeproc-py uses `semantic versioning`_. Currently, its major versionnumber is still at 0, meaning the API is not yet stable. However, youshould not expect to see any major API changes soon... _CSL: http://citationstyles.org/.. _CSL 1.0.1 specification: https://docs.citationstyles.org/en/1.0.1/specification.html.. _semantic versioning: http://semver.org/Requirements------------citeproc-py supports Python 3.6 and up. It depends on `lxml`_ for parsing andnavigating the CSL style and locale files... _lxml: http://lxml.de/Installation------------The recommended way of installing citeproc-py is by using `pip`_::   pip install citeproc-pyIf lxml isn't installed, pip will try to install it for you... _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/If you insist, you can manually install citeproc-py from distribution packageshosted at `PyPI`_. Please ignore the release archives offered by GitHub... _PyPI: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citeproc-py/Getting Started---------------To get started with citeproc-py, take a look at the examples under``examples/``. Two examples are provided, one parsing references from aJSON representation of references as supported by citeproc-js, anotherparsing the references from a BibTeX file. Both show and explain how tocite references and render the bibliography.CSL Compatibility-----------------Currently, citeproc-py passes almost 60% of the (relevant) tests in the`citeproc-test suite`_. However, it is more than 60% complete, asciteproc-py doesn't take care of double spaces and repeated punctuationmarks yet, making a good deal of the tests fail. In addition, thefollowing features have not yet been implemented (there are probablysome I forgot though):-  disambiguation/year-suffix-  et-al-subsequent-min/et-al-subsequent-use-first-  collapsing-  punctuation-in-quote-  displayAlso, some `citeproc-js`_ functionality that is not part of the CSL specis not (yet) supported:-  raw dates-  static-ordering-  literal names.. _citeproc-test suite: https://github.com/citation-style-language/test-suite.. _citeproc-js: https://github.com/juris-m/citeproc-jsRunning the Tests-----------------First clone the `citeproc-test suite`_ so that it sits next to theciteproc-py directory. Now you can run ``citeproc-test.py`` (in the ``tests``directory). Run ``citeproc-test.py --help`` to see its usage information.Changelog---------Release 0.6.0 (2021-05-27)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Bug fixes* Various issues on Windows: testing, explicit utf-8 encoding* Strings with unescaped \ declared r&quot;aw&quot;Other changes:* Removed support for Python 2.7, 3.5 and added for 3.9* Travis CI is removed in favor of GitHub actions testing across  all 3 major OSes (MacOS, Windows, GNU/Linux Ubuntu)* CSL test-suite progressed from 5779a8c to c3db429Release 0.5.1 (2020-03-06)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Bug fixed:* avoid rnc2rng 2.6.2 which breaks installation of citeproc-pyRelease 0.5.0 (2020-02-09)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Enhancements:* handle commas and ampersands in a functional style* Number: handle commas and ampersands* added symbol for textquotesingle* specify fallback locales for fr-CA and es-CL* improved page number and ranges parsingBug fixed:* don't fail on empty page ranges (#90) (bbm)* detect end of file while parsing incorrect bib (#59) (John Vandenberg)Other changes:* Removed 3.2-3.4 and added 3.7, 3.8 to supported Pythons* Refactored locales handlingRelease 0.4.0 (2017-06-23)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~New features:* allow specifying the encoding of a BibTeX database file (#20 and #25)* BibTeX 'month' field: support integers and &quot;&lt;month&gt; &lt;day&gt;&quot; values* BibTeX 'pages' field: support &quot;10&quot;, &quot;10+&quot;, &quot;10-12&quot; and &quot;10--12&quot; formats* BibTeX entry types: map the non-standard 'thesis' and 'report' entries* update the CSL schema to version 1.0.1 (#5)* update the CSL locales to commit 49bf3fc0Bug fixed:* avoid crash when there is nothing to affix (David Lesieur)* fix BibTeX month to CSL month mapping (#24)* strip leading/trailing whitespace from BibTeX values (#37)Release 0.3.0 (2014-11-07)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Major improvements to the BibTeX parser:* split names into parts and assign them to the equivalent CSL name parts* fixed handling of accent macros and escaped characters* more compatible (La)TeX macro handling in general (but still basic)* handle standard Computer Modern ligatures such as --, ---, and &lt;&lt;* added unit tests for the BibTeX and LaTeX parsersOther changes:* disable RelaxNG validation of CSL styles by default (API change)Release 0.2.0 (2014-10-25)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* bad cite callback function can determine how a bad cite is displayed (hetsch)* added option to disable RelaxNG validation (Jasper Op de Coul)* distutils was replaced with setuptools (Joshua Carp)* bug fixes (Yaroslav Halchenko, David Lesieur)* CitationStylesBibliography.bibliography() now returns the list of entries</longdescription>

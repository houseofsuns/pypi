Python2 and all Python3 versions that have past their end-of-life date may still work but are nolonger supported.  ## Installation```bashpip install pynut3```## UsageAssuming you have a UPS which is connected to a host on the network with IP `192.168.2.17` it can be interogated as follows:```python3from pynut3 import nut3client = nut3.PyNUT3Client(host='192.168.2.17')print(client.help())ups_dict = client.list_ups()for k1, v1 in ups_dict.items():    print(f&quot;{v1} is called with id {k1}&quot;)    vars_dict = client.list_vars(k1)    for k2, v2 in vars_dict.items():        print(f&quot;{k2}\t:\t{v2}&quot;)```Please note that this module has completely and intentionally broken backwards compatibility with (previous) versions of PyNUT.## AcknowledgementsBased on various NUT Client related Python scripts, written by David Goncalves as [PyNUT](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/tree/master/scripts/python), and released under GPL v3.   Later overhauled by rshipp with Python3 modifications by hordurk, george2 and mezz64.Others will have contributed along the way. I was not able to reliably find their names.Further updates in this fork are by me (Mausy5043) and based/inspired on prior work from timurlenk07, StSAV012, rshipp &amp; Rojer-X86## LicenseThe GPL v3 license continues to apply.

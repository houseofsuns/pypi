	<longdescription>sftpretty=========A pretty quick and simple interface to paramiko SFTP. Provides multi-threadedroutines with progress notifications for reliable, asynchronous transfers. APython3 optimized fork of pysftp with additional features &amp; improvements.* Built-in retry decorator* Hash function for integrity checking* Improved local &amp; remote directory mapping* Improved logging mechanism* More tests* Multi-threaded directory transfers* OpenSSH config file support* Progress notifications* Support for ciphers, compression, digests, kex &amp; key type options* Support for disabled algorithms* Support for ED25519 &amp; ECDSA keys* Support for private key passwords* Thread-safe connection manager* Transfer ResumptionExample-------.. code-block:: python    from sftpretty import CnOpts, Connection    # Basic    with Connection('hostname', username='me', password='secret') as sftp:        # Temporarily chdir to public/.        with sftp.cd('public'):            # Upload file to public/ on remote.            sftp.put('/my/local/filename')            # Download a remote file from public/.            sftp.get('remote_file')    with Connection('hostname', private_key='~/.ssh/id_ed25519',                    private_key_pass='secret') as sftp:        # Upload local directory to remote_directory.        sftp.put_d('/my/local', '/remote_directory')        # Recursively download a remote_directory and save it to /tmp locally.        sftp.get_r('remote_directory', '/tmp')    # Advanced    # Use password authentication    with Connection('hostname', username='me', password='secret') as sftp:        # Upload local directory to remote_directory.

These areintended as an easy platform-independent tool to create zip files withan arbitrary file name and an arbitrary root (the top-level folder afterextracting a zip) from files and folders at arbitrary locations on the filesystem.Typical usage includes:*   Deploy zip archives of Sphinx-documentation while releasing Python packages:    .. code-block:: shell        zip-folder --auto-root --outfile docs/_build/artifacts/mypackage-v1.0.0.zip docs/_build/html    creates a file ``mypackage-v1.0.0.zip`` in ``docs/_build/artifacts`` that    unzips as a folder ``mypackage-v1.0.0`` containing the files originally in    ``docs/_build/html/``.*   Create zip files pulled together from different locations, for emailing:    .. code-block:: shell        zip-files -a -o report.zip ./report2020-01.tex /scratch/project/plots/*.pdf    creates a file ``report.zip`` that unzips as a folder    ``report`` containing the file ``report2020-01.tex`` and all the pdf files    originally in ``/scratch/project/plots/``.    .. code-block:: shell        zip-files -f report2020-01 -o report.zip ./report2020-01.tex /scratch/project/plots/*.pdf    does the same, but unzips as a folder ``report2020-01`` instead of ``report``.Development of zip-files happens on `Github`_.Installation------------To install the latest released version of zip-files, run this command in your terminal:.. code-block:: shell    pip install zip_filesThis is the preferred method to install zip-files, as it will always installthe most recent stable release.  It will result in the executable commands``zip-files`` and ``zip-folder`` being added to your environment's ``bin``folder... _Github: https://github.com/goerz/zip_filesUsage-----zip-files~~~~~~~~~.. code-block:: console    Usage: zip-files [OPTIONS] [FILES]...

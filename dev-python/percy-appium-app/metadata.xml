	<longdescription># percy-appium-python[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/percy-appium-app.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/percy-appium-app/)![Test](https://github.com/percy/percy-appium-python/workflows/Test/badge.svg)[Percy](https://percy.io) visual testing for Python Appium.## Installationnpm install `@percy/cli`:```sh-session$ npm install --save-dev @percy/cli```pip install Percy appium package:```ssh-session$ pip install percy-appium-app```&gt; Note: This package is tested on Python versions 3.6, 3.8, 3.9 as part of unit tests. It should ideally work on all Python 3.6+ versions[NOTE] Appium-Python-Client(&gt;= v2.9.0) is having compatibility issues with urllib3 latest versions. To solve the issue it is recommended to add `urllib3&gt;=1.26.15,&lt;2` in your requirements.txt file.## UsageThis is an example test using the `percy_screenshot` function.``` pythonfrom appium import webdriverfrom percy import percy_screenshotdriver = webdriver.Remote(&quot;https://&quot; + userName + &quot;:&quot; + accessKey + &quot;@hub-cloud.browserstack.com/wd/hub&quot;, desired_caps)# take a screenshotpercy_screenshot(driver, 'here is some name')```Running the test above normally will result in the following log:```sh-session[percy] Percy is not running, disabling screenshots```When running with [`percyapp:exec`](https://github.com/percy/cli/tree/master/packages/cli-exec#app-exec), and your project's`PERCY_TOKEN`, a new Percy build will be created and screenshots will be uploaded to your project.```sh-session$ export PERCY_TOKEN=[your-project-token]$ percy app:exec -- [python test command][percy] Percy has started![percy] Created build #1: https://percy.io/[your-project][percy] Screenshot taken &quot;Python example&quot;[percy] Stopping percy...[percy] Finalized build #1: https://percy.io/[your-project][percy] Done!```## Configuration`percy_screenshot(driver, name[, **kwargs])`- `driver` (**required**) - A appium driver instance- `name` (**required**) - The screenshot name; must be unique to each screenshot- `device_name` (**optional**) - The device name used for capturing screenshot- `orientation` (**optional**) - Orientation of device while capturing screeenshot; Allowed values [`portrait` | `landscape`]- `status_bar_height` (**optional**) - Height of status bar; int- `nav_bar_height` (**optional**) - Height of navigation bar; int- `full_screen` (**optional**) - Indicate whether app is full screen; boolean- `fullpage` (**optional**) - [Experimental] only supported on App Automate driver sessions [ needs @percy/cli 1.20.2+ ]; boolean- `screen_lengths` (**optional**) - [Experimental] max screen lengths for fullPage [ needs @percy/cli 1.20.2+ ]; boolean- `scrollable_xpath` (**optional**) - [Experimental] scrollable element xpath for fullpage [ needs @percy/cli 1.20.2+ ]; string- `scrollable_id` (**optional**) - [Experimental] scrollable element accessibility id for fullpage [ needs @percy/cli 1.20.2+ ]; string- `ignore_regions_xpaths` (**optional**) - elements xpaths that user want to ignore in visual diff [ needs @percy/cli 1.23.0+ ]; list of string- `ignore_region_accessibility_ids` (**optional**) - elements accessibility_ids that user want to ignore in visual diff [ needs @percy/cli 1.23.0+ ]; list of string- `ignore_region_appium_elements` (**optional**) - appium elements that user want to ignore in visual diff [ needs @percy/cli 1.23.0+ ]; list of appium element object- `custom_ignore_regions` (**optional**) - custom locations that user want to ignore in visual diff [ needs @percy/cli 1.23.0+ ]; list of ignore_region object  - IgnoreRegion:-    - Description: This class represents a rectangular area on a screen that needs to be ignored for visual diff.    - Constructor:      ```      init(self, top, bottom, left, right)      ```    - Parameters:      `top` (int): Top coordinate of the ignore region.      `bottom` (int): Bottom coordinate of the ignore region.      `left` (int): Left coordinate of the ignore region.      `right` (int): Right coordinate of the ignore region.    - Raises:ValueError: If top, bottom, left, or right is less than 0 or top is greater than or equal to bottom or left is greater than or equal to right.    - valid: Ignore region should be within the boundaries of the screen.## Running with Hybrid AppsFor a hybrid app, we need to switch to native context before taking screenshot.- Add a helper method similar to following for say flutter based hybrid app:```pythondef percy_screenshot_flutter(driver, name: str, **kwargs):  driver.switch_to.context('NATIVE_APP')  percy_screenshot(driver, name, **kwargs)  driver.switch_to.context('FLUTTER')```- Call PercyScreenshotFlutter helper function when you want to take screenshot.```pythonpercy_screenshot_flutter(driver, name, **kwargs)```&gt; Note: &gt;&gt; For other hybrid apps the `driver.switch_to.context('FLUTTER')` would change to context that it uses like say WEBVIEW etc.&gt;## Running Percy on Automate`percy_screenshot(driver, name, options)` [ needs @percy/cli 1.27.0-beta.0+ ];- `driver` (**required**) - A appium driver instance- `name` (**required**) - The screenshot name; must be unique to each screenshot- `options` (**optional**) - There are various options supported by percy_screenshot to server further functionality.    - `freeze_animation` - Boolean value by default it falls back to `false`, you can pass `true` and percy will freeze image based animations.    - `percy_css` - Custom CSS to be added to DOM before the screenshot being taken. Note: This gets removed once the screenshot is taken.    - `ignore_region_xpaths` - elements in the DOM can be ignored using xpath    - `ignore_region_selectors` - elements in the DOM can be ignored using selectors.    - `ignore_region_appium_elements` - elements can be ignored using appium_elements.    - `custom_ignore_regions` - elements can be ignored using custom boundaries      - IgnoreRegion:-        - Description: This class represents a rectangular area on a screen that needs to be ignored for visual diff.        - Constructor:          ```          init(self, top, bottom, left, right)          ```        - Parameters:          `top` (int): Top coordinate of the ignore region.          `bottom` (int): Bottom coordinate of the ignore region.          `left` (int): Left coordinate of the ignore region.          `right` (int): Right coordinate of the ignore region.        - Raises:ValueError: If top, bottom, left, or right is less than 0 or top is greater than or equal to bottom or left is greater than or equal to right.        - valid: Ignore region should be within the boundaries of the screen.### Creating Percy on automate buildNote: Automate Percy Token starts with `auto` keyword. The command can be triggered using `exec` keyword.```sh-session$ export PERCY_TOKEN=[your-project-token]$ percy exec -- [python test command][percy] Percy has started![percy] [Python example] : Starting automate screenshot ...[percy] Screenshot taken &quot;Python example&quot;[percy] Stopping percy...[percy] Finalized build #1: https://percy.io/[your-project][percy] Done!```Refer to docs here: [Percy on Automate](https://docs.percy.io/docs/integrate-functional-testing-with-visual-testing)### Migrating ConfigIf you have a previous Percy configuration file, migrate it to the newest version with the[`config:migrate`](https://github.com/percy/cli/tree/master/packages/cli-config#percy-configmigrate-filepath-output) command:```sh-session$ percy config:migrate```</longdescription>

If location has ' ' in name, input location wrapped with double quotes: --location &quot;LOCATION NAME&quot;additional (optional) arguments:  -ota         Updating FW version to latest for all devices  -no_gp_zone          don't use Global pacing group by zone (all bridges will be GPG=0)  -pacing_interval PACING_INTERVAL                        Pacing interval for all devices  -ignore_bridges [IGNORE_BRIDGES [IGNORE_BRIDGES ...]]                        bridges to ignore in the tool - their configuration won't be changed  -expected_num_brgs EXPECTED_NUM_BRGS                        Number of expected bridges in location. The tool will try to connect to all bridges (excluding those specified in ignore bridges) until reaching expected number.example usage: wlt-config --owner wiliot --location &quot;My Deployment&quot; --ota_upgrade --pacing_interval 10 --ignore_bridges 1234ABCD0123```### Calibration ManagementConfigure Wiliot Bridge calibration mode, broadcast is optional```usage: wlt-calibration-mgmt -owner OwnerID -brg BridgeID -gw GW -mode CalibrationMode [-timeout TIMEOUT]usage (broadcast): wlt-calibration-mgmt -owner OwnerID -gw GW -mode CalibrationMode [-timeout TIMEOUT]required arguments:  -owner OWNER  Owner ID  -brg BRG      Bridge ID (required only for non broadcast)  -gw GW        GW ID to configure bridge (required only for broadcast)  -mode Mode    CalibrationMode on of 3 options: 0-regular, 1-no ch37, 2-ch37 on data onlyoptional arguments:  -timeout TIMEOUT      Minutes timeout (not required, defaults to 5 minutes)  example usage: wlt-calibration-mgmt -owner wiliot -brg 0123ABCD -gw AB1234CD -mode 1```### Firmware UpdateUpdate Wiliot Gateways and Bridges firmware version OTA. #### Print Available Versions  Prints all avaliable Firmware versions for update for every GW Type```usage: wlt-firmware -owner OWNER [-beta] versionsoptional arguments:  -beta              show available beta versions / update to beta firmwareexample usage: wlt-firmware -o wiliot versions``` #### Firmware Update Run OTA Process, first updating specified GWs to latest / specified FW version.

As a result, the CAcertificates included in the OS are no longer usable. To avoid getting SSL related errors from the code when running under this setup you needto execute Install Certificates.command Python script. Typically you will find it under~~~~/Applications/Python\ 3.7/Install\ Certificates.command~~~~-----------------#### Python 3 on MacOSThe default Python version on mac is 2.x. Since Wiliot package requires Python 3.x you should download Python3 (e.g.  Python3.7) and make python 3 your default.There are many ways how to do it such as add python3 to your PATH (one possible solution https://www.educative.io/edpresso/how-to-add-python-to-the-path-variable-in-mac)</longdescription>

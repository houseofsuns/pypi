You can customize the exact mix by specifying one or more [extras](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/?highlight=extras#installing-extras) when installing the package. ### Core installed packages| package       | Description                       || ------------- | --------------------------------- || bandit        | Finds common security issues      || commitizen    | Standardizes commit messages      || isort         | Sorts imports                     || pre-commit    | Pre-commit hook manager           || pylint        | Static code analysis              || pytest        | Testing with Python               || pytest-cov    | Coverage support for pytest       || pytest-pylint | Pylint support for pytest         || safety        | Dependency vulnerability scanning || wheel         | Package distribution tools        || yamllint      | Lint YAML configuration files     || yapf          | Customizable code formatting      |### Installed and required by pib_cli| package       | Description                        || ------------- | ---------------------------------- || click         | Command line interface toolkit     || jsonschema    | JSON Schema validation for Python  || GitPython     | Interact with Git repositories     || PyYAML        | YAML parser and emitter for Python |  - `pip install pib_cli` to install only these dependencies.  - These become indirect **development** dependencies of **YOUR** project, so it's good to keep that in mind.### 'docs' extras| package                   | Description                                                || ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- || darglint                  | Sphinx style guide enforcement                             || sphinx                    | Python documentation generator                             || sphinx-autopackagesummary | Template nested module content                             || sphinx_rtd_theme          | The [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) Sphinx theme |   - `pip install pib_cli[docs]` to add these dependencies to the core installation.### 'docstrings' extras| package    | Description                       || ---------- | --------------------------------- || pydocstyle | PEP 257 enforcement               |  - `pip install[docstrings]` to add these dependencies to the core installation.### 'types' extras| package    | Description                       || ---------- | --------------------------------- || mypy       | Static type checker               |  - `pip install pib_cli[types]` to add these dependencies to the core installation.### 'pib_docs' extras| package                   | Description                                                || ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- || sphinx                    | Python documentation generator                             || sphinx-autopackagesummary | Templates nested module content                            || sphinx-click              | Generates CLI documentation                                || sphinx-intl               | Generates documentation translations                       || sphinx-jsonschema         | Generates JSON schema documentation                        || sphinx_rtd_theme          | The [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) Sphinx theme |   - `pip install pib_cli[pib_docs]` to add these dependencies to the core installation.  - These extras exist only to support building `pib_cli` documentation- they aren't meant to be consumed by user projects.### Installing multiple extrasThis is straightforward to do:  - `pip install pib_cli[docs,docstrings,types]`## Customizing the Command Line InterfaceThe most powerful feature of `pib_cli` is its ability to customize how it interacts with the packages it brings to your project.  In this way it's very similar to the standard Linux [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) command- with the notable difference being that `pib_cli` is packaged with a suite of Python libraries.**The CLI configuration file is in YAML format, and conforms to [this](https://github.com/niall-byrne/pib_cli/blob/master/pib_cli/config/schemas) set of JSON schemas.**  - pib_cli v1.0.0 introduces a [new JSON schema version](https://github.com/niall-byrne/pib_cli/blob/master/pib_cli/config/schemas/cli_base_schema_v2.0.0.json).  - pib_cli v1.2.0 introduces [further refinements to the JSON schema](https://github.com/niall-byrne/pib_cli/blob/master/pib_cli/config/schemas/cli_base_schema_v2.1.0.json) but is fully backwards compatible with v1.0.0, and **ALL** legacy configuration files.### Creating a '.pib.yml' fileThe `.pib.yml` file is where you can take control, and customize `pib_cli` behaviour to suit your particular needs.  This file should adhere to the specification detailed above- read on for further detail.The top level of your `.pib.yml` file should include metadata information.  This metadata is used to tell `pib_cli` where to find your project's codebase and any documentation (Sphinx) definitions.```yamlmetadata:  project_name: &quot;Tell pib_cli the folder your codebase is in.&quot;  documentation_root: &quot;Tell pib_cli where to find your documentation definitions.&quot;cli_definition:  - [A YAML array of cli command definitions, which are detailed in the next section].```  - The `cli_definition` section is mandatory, and `pib_cli` will throw an error if it's missing.  - The metadata itself though is actually optional, and can also be declared using environment variables.**Understanding pib_cli metadata**Metadata tells `pib_cli` where to find your project's files, so it's important to set these values appropriately:  - `project_name` is your project's name from a Python perspective.  It's the top level folder (inside your git repository) that houses your codebase, such that `from &lt;project_name&gt; import *` would be accessing your codebase.  - `documentation_root` is a relative path from your repository's root to a folder containing a Sphinx Makefile.  This is purely a convenience definition for any documentation related commands.**Environment variables and pib_cli**You may also define your project's metadata by setting environment variables.  This would allow you to reuse the same CLI configuration for multiple projects:  - `project_name` can also be defined by `PIB_PROJECT_NAME` environment variable  - `documentation_root` can also be defined by the `PIB_DOCUMENTATION_ROOT` environment variableWhen configuration AND environment variables exist, `pib_cli` will **prefer to use environment variable values**.**Environment variables and pib_cli commands**Regardless of whether you have used configuration or environment variables, when your CLI commands are executed, the environment variables will be available in the shell:  - `PIB_PROJECT_NAME` will always be defined and accessible from inside the shell  - `PIB_DOCUMENTATION_ROOT` will always be defined and accessible from inside the shell### Adding a CLI definition to a '.pib.yml' fileThe `cli_definition` YAML key, should contain a list of definitions for CLI commands you wish to use.Each command should adhere to this format (and you can have many commands for whatever tasks you need to perform):```yaml    - name: &quot;command-name&quot;      description: &quot;A description of the command.&quot;      container_only: false # Optional restriction of the command to a PIB container      path: &quot;repo_root&quot;      commands:        - &quot;one or more&quot;        - &quot;shell commands&quot;        - &quot;each run in a discrete environment&quot;        - &quot;The ${PIB_DOCUMENTATION_ROOT} environment variable is also available if you need to navigate to that folder.&quot;        - &quot;The ${PIB_PROJECT_NAME} environment variable is available if you need to navigate to that folder.&quot;        - &quot;Any extra arguments passed are stored in the ${PIB_OVERLOAD_ARGUMENTS} environment variable.&quot;      success: &quot;Success Message&quot;      failure: &quot;Failure Message&quot;```Notes on this configuration format:   - `container_only` restricts the command to working only inside a [Python-in-a-Box](https://github.com/niall-byrne/python-in-a-box) container environment.  (Completely optional key to include, defaults to `false`.)  - `path` must be one of:    - `repo_root` (The root folder of your code repository.)    - `documentation_root` (Defaults to the folder `documentation`, can be customized with metadata or environment variables.)    - `project_root` (The `project_name` folder as defined with metadata or environment variables.)### Validating a '.pib.yml' fileUse `pib_cli` to validate new configuration files before activating them:  - `dev @pib config -c &lt;path to your file&gt; validate`### Activating a '.pib.yml' fileTo `activate` your configuration, use one of the following methods:   1. You can set the environment variable `PIB_CONFIG_FILE_LOCATION` to the absolute path where the file is located.   2. Or just move your new `.pib.yml` file to the top level folder (the repository root) of your project.Use the command `dev @pib config where` to confirm it's been activated.If a `.pib.yml` file cannot be found with either of these methods, then the [default config](https://github.com/niall-byrne/pib_cli/blob/master/pib_cli/config/default_cli_config.yml) will be used.## Development Guide for `pib_cli`Please see the documentation [here](https://github.com/niall-byrne/pib_cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).## Environment Variable SummaryThis table summarizes the environment variables that can be used with `pib_cli`:| Name                      | Purpose                                                                   || ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- || PIB_CONFIG_FILE_LOCATION  | The absolute path to the configuration file that should be used.          | | PIB_DOCUMENTATION_ROOT    | A relative path from the repository root where a Sphinx Makefile lives.   || PIB_OVERLOAD_ARGUMENTS    | Reserved to pass arguments to customized CLI commands.                    || PIB_PROJECT_NAME          | The top level folder in the repository where the codebase is found.       |</longdescription>

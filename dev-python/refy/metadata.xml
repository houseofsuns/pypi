	<longdescription># refyA scientific papers recommendation tool.## Overview`refy` leverages Natural Langual Processing (NLP) machine learning tools to find new papers that might be relevant given the ones that you've read already. There's a few software tools out there that facilitate the exploration of scientific literature, including:* [meta.org](https://www.meta.org/) which allows users to set up feeds that identify newly published papers that seem relevant given a set of *keywords** [inciteful](https://inciteful.xyz/) and [scite.ai](https://scite.ai/) let you explore the network of citations around a given paper of interest* [connected papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/) let's you visualize a graph representation of papers related to a given paper of interestMost currently available software is limited in two key ways:1. Tools like [meta.org](https://www.meta.org/) rely on keywords, but keywords (e.g. computational neuroscience, Parkinson's Disease) are often overly general. As a result of that you have to sift through a lot irrelevant literature before you find something interesting2. Other tools like [connected papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/) only work with one input paper at the time: you give it the title of a paper you've read and they give you suggestions. This is limiting: any software that can analyse **all papers you've read** can use a lot more information to find new papers that match more closely your interests.This is what `refy` is for: **`refy` analyzes the abstracts of several papers of yours and matches them agaist published preprints**. By using many input papers at once `refy` has a lot more information at its disposal which (hopefully) means that it can better recommend relevant papers. By using the abstracts and not the paper titles, authors or keywords, `refy` focuses exclusively on the content of an article and has access to a wealth of data.Refy downloads recently published preprints from BiorXiv and ArXiv, we thank BiorXiv and ArXiv for the API services they made freely available.## Usage### InstallationIf you have an environment with `python &gt;= 3.6`, you can install `refy` with:```pip install refy```### getting suggested papers```pythonimport refyd = refy.Recomender( 'library.bib',            # path to your .bib file  n_days=30,               # fetch preprints from the last N days  html_path=&quot;test.html&quot;,   # save results to a .html (Optional)  N=10                     # number of recomended papers )```</longdescription>

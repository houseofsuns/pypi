	<longdescription># SRMD ncnn Vulkan Python![CI](https://github.com/ArchieMeng/srmd-ncnn-vulkan-python/workflows/CI/badge.svg)[srmd-ncnn-vulkan](https://github.com/nihui/srmd-ncnn-vulkan) is nihui's ncnn implementation of srmd converter. Runs fast on Intel / AMD / Nvidia with Vulkan API.This project is a Python wrapper of nihui's project.srmd-ncnn-vulkan-python wraps [srmd-ncnn-vulkan project](https://github.com/nihui/srmd-ncnn-vulkan) by SWIG to make it easier to integrate srmd-ncnn-vulkan with existing python projects.This project only wrapped the original SRMD class. As a result, functions other than the core upscaling and denoising such as multi-thread loading and saving are not available. Of course, the auto tilesize and prepadding settings are implements, so don't worry about them.## [Download](https://github.com/ArchieMeng/srmd-ncnn-vulkan-python/releases)linux x64, Windows x64 and MacOS x64 releases are available now. For other platforms, you may compile it on your own.The reason why MacOS ARM64 build is not available is that it needs ARM Python Dev Libs which I have no ideas on how toget it on Github's MacOS x64 VM. Moreover, I don't have a Mac.## BuildFirst, you have to install python, python development package (Python native development libs in Visual Studio), vulkan SDK and SWIG on your platform. And then:### Linux1. install dependencies: cmake, vulkan sdk, swig and python-devDebian, Ubuntu and other Debian-like Distros```shellapt-get install cmake libvulkan-dev swig python3-dev```Arch Distros```shellpacman -S base-devel cmake vulkan-headers vulkan-icd-loader swig python````2. Build with CMake```shellgit clone https://github.com/ArchieMeng/srmd-ncnn-vulkan-python.gitcd srmd-ncnn-vulkan-pythongit submodule update --init --recursivecmake -B build srccd buildmake```### WindowsI used Visual Studio 2019 and msvc v142 to build this project for Windows.Install visual studio and open the project directory, and build. Job done.The only problem on Windows is that, you cannot use [CMake for Windows](https://cmake.org/download/) to generate the Visual Studio solution file and build it. This will make the lib crash on loading.The only way is [use Visual Studio to open the project as directory](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/visual-cobol/vc50/VS2019/GUID-BE1C48AA-DB22-4F38-9644-E9B48658EF36.html), and build it from Visual Studio.1. install dependencies: cmake, vulkan sdk, swig and python-dev- download vulkan sdk from https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home- download SWIG from http://www.swig.org/download.html- install python with dev libs either from official website or Visual Studio  (The python dev environment and python native dev libs components)2. cmake the project. Either reference the linux build method or just do it on Visual Studio.### Mac OS X1. install dependencies: cmake, vulkan sdk, swig and python-dev- download vulkan sdk from https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home- If you have homebrew installed, run the command below to get SWIG```shellbrew install swig```- I guess python dev is out-of-box in Mac. If not, google it.2. Build with CMake- You can pass -DUSE_STATIC_MOLTENVK=ON option to avoid linking the vulkan loader library on MacOS```shellgit clone https://github.com/ArchieMeng/srmd-ncnn-vulkan-python.gitcd srmd-ncnn-vulkan-pythongit submodule update --init --recursivecmake -B build srccd buildmake```## Usages### Example program```pythonfrom PIL import Imagefrom srmd_ncnn_vulkan import Srmdim = Image.open(&quot;0.jpg&quot;)upscaler = Srmd(gpuid=0)out_im = upscaler.process(im)out_im.save(&quot;1.png&quot;)```## Original SRMD Project- https://github.com/cszn/SRMD- https://github.com/cszn/KAIR- https://github.com/nihui/srmd-ncnn-vulkan## Other Open-Source Code Used- https://github.com/Tencent/ncnn for fast neural network inference on ALL PLATFORMS- https://github.com/nothings/stb for decoding and encoding image on Linux / MacOS- https://github.com/tronkko/dirent for listing files in directory on Windows</longdescription>

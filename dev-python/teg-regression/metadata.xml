	<longdescription>Linear regression, with p-values and AIC for the full model, p-values per coefficient, and tests of linear constraints on regression coefficients. The formulas are based on Bingham &amp; Fry.The module uses only the modules numpy and math (built-in).## Basic usageBy default, do not add an explicit intercept to the predictors. The intercept will be appended as an additional predictor, unless the argument explicit_intercept is given and set to True (for if you want to define constraints involving the intercept).Example, using simulated data:import numpy as npimport teg_regressionnObs = 300nPred = 5fix_coeffs = {0: 1, 3: 2} # Set to empty dict to simulate the null model.X, y = teg_regression.sim_data(nObs, nPred, fix_coeffs=fix_coeffs, fix_intercept=20)O = teg_regression.run_regression(X, y)The function returns a dictionary O with statistical values and prints out (unless report=False is set as an argument):Test of the model:F(5,294) = 0.849, p = 0.516AIC constrained - free = -1.28e+03 (negative supports constraints).Tests per coefficient.Predictor 0: b = 0.00522, F(1,294) = 0.00842, p = 0.927Predictor 1: b = 0.00324, F(1,294) = 0.00373, p = 0.951Predictor 2: b = -0.0759, F(1,294) = 1.88, p = 0.172Predictor 3: b = -0.093, F(1,294) = 2.69, p = 0.102Predictor 4: b = 0.0182, F(1,294) = 0.115, p = 0.735Intercept: b = 20.6, F(1,294) = 1.04e+05, p = 1.11e-16### Linear constraintsLinear constraints specify hypotheses in terms of weighted sums of the coefficients, to be tested against the free model. E.g., assuming we have four predictors, the matrix equation[1 0 0 0]           [0][0 1 0 0] * betas = [0][0 0 1 0]           [0]would constrain the first three predictors to be zero.Similarly,[1 -1 0 0] * betas = 0Would constrain the first and second predictor to be equal.The Constraints argument, specifying the desired hypothesis, is a dictionary with the &quot;coefficients&quot; matrix, as a 2D array, and the &quot;constants&quot; vector, also as an array. The example below shows the Constraints setup to set two specific predictor-coefficients to 0.pred_to_test = [1, 2]Constraints = {}Constraints['coefficients'] = np.array([[0 for a in range(X.shape[1])] for newrow in range(2)]).reshape(2, X.shape[1])Constraints['coefficients'][0][pred_to_test[0]] = 1Constraints['coefficients'][1][pred_to_test[1]] = 1Constraints['constants'] = np.array([0, 0])O = teg_regression.run_regression(X, y, Constraints)</longdescription>

	<longdescription># AWSC - AWS CommanderAWSC is a tool inspired by [k9s](https://github.com/derailed/k9s) - the goal is to create a similarly easy to use terminal-based UI for the AWS API.## Installation### RequirementsAWSC has been tested with and therefore requires python 3.8 or later.### Stable releasesAWSC is available on pypi and can be installed via pip.```bash$ pip3 install awsc````### Edge versionsYou can install the latest git revision from the root directory of the repository by issuing:```bash$ sudo python3 setup.py install```## First useThrough either installation method, the `awsc` binary should become available.Upon launching AWSC, you are prompted to set an encryption key (password) for your database of access credentials. You will have to enter this encryption key every time you launch AWSC.You will then be taken to the list of AWS contexts and you should see an empty list. You can either add a new context by pressing a - you'll have to add your access and secret key manually; or you can import the current AWS CLI context by pressing i.For navigation , refer to the top right hotkey display on each screen.### Command paletteThe command palette can be accessed by pressing :. This allows you to navigate between the different AWS resources. Most resources have short names that are accepted, but the full name of the resource without spaces should also be accepted. For an exhaustive list of commands that are available, type 'help' and press enter.### DefaultsYou can configure a default context, region and ssh key in their relevant screens. These are remembered and automatically set on each launch. Your default SSH key is only used if the keypair for the instance you are accessing does not already have an associated SSH key.## Version historyRefer to the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for release notes on versions.</longdescription>

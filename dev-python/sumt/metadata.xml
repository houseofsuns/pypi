The input trees can be in one or more input files, and will typically be from a Bayesian MCMC analysis (BEAST or MrBayes for instance) or from a bootstrap procedure. `sumt` can compute four different kinds of main tree summaries:* Majority rule consensus tree* Majority rule consensus tree, with all compatible bipartitions added* Maximum clade credibility tree* Maximum bipartition credibility treeBranch labels on these trees indicate clade support. `sumt` also produces a summary of observed bipartitions along with branch length means and variances and, optionally, a list of tree topologies and how frequently they were observed. The name is taken from the `sumt` command in [MrBayes](https://nbisweden.github.io/MrBayes/index.html), whose functionality it was originally meant to resemble. Clade support values and topology frequencies can be interpreted as posterior probabilities if the input trees are from a Bayesian MCMC analysis.## AvailabilityThe `sumt` source code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/agormp/sumt. The executable can be installed from PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/sumt/## Installation```python3 -m pip install sumt```Upgrading to latest version:```python3 -m pip install --upgrade sumt```## Dependencies`sumt` relies on the [phylotreelib library](https://github.com/agormp/phylotreelib) for phylogeny-related matters, and on [psutil](https://pypi.org/project/psutil/) for (optionally) monitoring memory usage. These are automatically included when using pip to install.## Overview* Input:* One or more files containing phylogenetic trees (all trees must have same leaf names), in NEXUS or Newick format.* Typically trees are from a Bayesian MCMC analysis, but could also be from a bootstrap procedure* Can read sample files from BEAST and MrBayes* Output:* File containing summary tree with clade support values (= frequency of bipartition or clade in input trees).     * The summary tree can be one of these:    * Majority rule consensus tree    * Majority rule consensus tree, with all compatible bipartitions added* Maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree     * Maximum bipartition credibility (MBC) tree - this is similar to MCC, but ignoring location of root.    * The file also contains a second consensus tree where branch labels indicate bipartition IDs, which can be used for interpreting bipartition file below.* File containing list of bipartitions (in &quot;*.&quot; format) present in input trees, along with mean and variance of corresponding branch lengths. This list includes both bipartitions that correspond to branches in the summary tree, and bipartitions not included in the summary tree (e.g., low frequency bipartitions).* During run: progress bar showing percentage of file analyzed* (Optionally) File containing list of observed tree topologies with posterior and cumulated probabilities* Optimized for speed and memory usage:* Consensus tree computed from 100,000 trees with 41 leaves in 28 s, using max 49 MB memory on 2021 MacBook (4,440 distinct bipartitions seen)* Same file processed in 30 s, using max 2.83 GB memory when also keeping track of topologies (74,283 distinct topologies seen)* Option to discard fraction of trees as burn-in (for Bayesian analyses)* Option to compute average standard deviation of split frequencies when multiple input files are given. This can be used as a measure of convergence of Bayesian analyses, assuming that different files represent independent MCMC chains.* Option to include all compatible bipartitions in consensus tree (in addition to those that are present in more than 50% of input trees).* Options to root consensus tree using either outgroup, midpoint, [minimum variance](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28800608/) rooting, or based on where root is most frequently placed in input tree sample* Option to set node depths to mean of those observed in input trees (only useful when input trees are based on clock model)* Option to set node depths using &quot;common ancestor heights&quot; in input trees (same as &quot;treeannotator -heights ca&quot; in the BEAST2 package; only useful when input trees are based on clock model)* Option to assign specific weights to different input files.* Option to automatically assign weights so all files have equal impact regardless of number of trees in them.* Option to set basename of output files (default: basename will be stem of input file name)* Program prints information about run to stdout:* Number of leaves on tree* Number of different toplogies seen in input trees (if also using option -t)* Number of bipartitions or clades seen in input trees, along with theoretical maximum* Number of bipartitions in summary tree, along with theoretical maximum* Indication of whether summary tree is resolved* Indication of whether summary tree has been explicitly rooted and how* Log credibility (sum of logs of bipartition or clade frequencies in summary tree)* Indication of how branch lengths have been set* Root credibility (when input trees are clock trees)* Report of maximum memory usage during processing## Usage```usage: sumt [-h] [--version] [--con | --all | --mcc | --mbc]            [--noblen | --biplen | --meandepth | --cadepth]            [--rootmid | --rootminvar | -r TAXON [TAXON ...] | --rootfile FILE |            --rootmaxfreq] [-b NUM] [-t NUM] [-s] [-f NUM] [-n] [-v] [-q] [--basename NAME]            [--autow] [--informat FORMAT] [-i FILE | -w WEIGHT FILE]Computes summary tree and statistics from set of phylogenetic treesoptions:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  --version             show the program's version number and exitType of summary tree (pick one option):  --con                 majority rule consensus tree  --all                 majority rule consensus tree with all compatible bipartitions added  --mcc                 Maximum Clade Credibility (MCC) tree. The MCC tree is determined by                        inspecting tree samples and selecting the tree that has the highest                        product of clade frequencies (= highest sum of log of clade                        frequencies). The MCC tree is therefore a tree that has been                        observed in the pool of tree samples, differing from the consensus                        tree which typically does not match any individual sample. NOTE 1:                        only meaningful if input trees are estimated using clock model.                        NOTE 2: by default, the MCC tree uses the rooting of the specific                        tree sample. This will often (but not always) correspond to the                        bipartition where the root is most commonly found in the input                        trees.  --mbc                 Maximum Bipartition Credibility (MBC) tree. The MBC tree is similar                        to the MCC tree but counting bipartitions instead of clades, i.e.                        ignoring rooting (two input trees can have the same set of                        bipartitions, but be rooted in different locations).Estimation of branch lengths (pick one option):  --noblen              Do not set branch lengths (only the topology and branch- or clade-                        support of the summary tree are estimated).  --biplen              Set branch lengths in summary tree based on average for                        corresponding leaf bipartitions:each branch in tree corresponds to                        a bipartition of the leaves into two groups. Branch lenghts are set                        to the mean of the length of thecorresponding bipartition across                        all input trees.  --meandepth           set node depth for each clade to mean node depth observed for that                        clade among input trees (and branch lengths are then based on these                        depths). Warning: option is intended for input trees estimated                        using a clock model. It requires that all clades in the summary                        tree have been observed in the input trees, and may fail for some                        rootings.NOTE: mean is computed across trees where the specific,                        monophyletic clade is present, and may therefore be based on very                        few (down to one) values. NOTE 2: may result in negative branch                        lengths.  --cadepth             'Common Ancestor depth'. Same as option '--height ca' in                        treeannotator. Uses all trees in input set when determining node-                        depths. For a given clade: (1) Find the most recent common ancestor                        of the leaves in that clade in each of the input trees. (2) Compute                        node-depth of clade as the mean of the depths of these MRCAs. This                        is different from --meandepth where only trees with that exact                        clade are included when computing the mean. Warning: option is                        intended for input trees estimated using a clock model. It requires                        that all clades in the summary tree have been observed in the input                        trees, and may fail for some rootings.Rooting of summary tree:  --rootmid             perform midpoint rooting of summary tree  --rootminvar          perform minimum variance rooting of summary tree  -r TAXON [TAXON ...]  root summary tree on specified outgroup taxon/taxa  --rootfile FILE       root summary tree on outgroup taxa listed in file (one name per                        line)  --rootmaxfreq         root summary tree on bipartition where root is located most                        frequently in input trees.

A bipartition - or split - is a division of leaf-names into two groups: those on one side of an internal branch, and those on the other side. Two trees with different topologies can have the same bipartition, and that internal branch is then said to have been observed in both trees. `sumt` keeps track of bipartition frequencies, as well as means and variances of the lengths of the corresponding branches. For branches included on the summary tree, the clade support value is the same as the value in the column PROB (i.e., the frequency of the bipartion among the input trees).Bipartitions are indicated using the &quot;asterisk and dots&quot; notation also used by e.g. MrBayes: Columns correspond to taxa (with column 1 = taxon 1). All taxa with &quot;\*&quot; (or &quot;.&quot;) are in the same half of the bipartition. The ID column contains either a leaf name or a numerical branchID that corresponds to branch labels given in the second tree in the consensus tree file (in this case there are 5 leaves, and therefore only two internal branches). Branch IDs are numbered consecutively in order of bipartition frequency (so the branch with ID=7 has the 7th highest observed bipartition frequency).```List of bipartitions:PART = Description of partition in .* formatPROB = Posterior probability of the partitionBLEN = Mean branch lengthVAR  = Branch length varianceSEM  = Standard error of the mean for branch lengthID   = Leaf name or internal branch label, for those bipartitions that are included in consensus treePART    PROB      BLEN       VAR          SEM          ID*....   1.000000  0.07561    (0.0003703)  (0.0003512)  Chimpanzee.*...   1.000000  0.3551     (0.01894  )  (0.002512 )  Gibbon..*..   1.000000  0.0728     (0.0005512)  (0.0004285)  Gorilla...*.   1.000000  0.05689    (0.0002746)  (0.0003025)  Human....*   1.000000  0.2793     (0.008997 )  (0.001731 )  Orangutan.*..*   1.000000  0.1464     (0.003637 )  (0.001101 )  6*..*.   0.971686  0.03674    (0.0004015)  (0.000371 )  7```#### Tree probabilitiesThis is the content of the file `primates.trprobs`. In this case there were only 5 leaves corresponding to a total of 15 possible trees, of which 3 were seen in the MCMC samples. Note: For data sets with more than about 15-20 taxa, each sampled tree will typically be unique and all topologies therefore have the same probability, meaning the credible set is not very useful. (Bipartitions or clades on those trees will, however, not be unique, and clade probabilities carry useful information).```#NEXUS[This file contains the 99% most probable trees found during theMCMC search, sorted by posterior probability (the 99% HPD interval).Lower case 'p' indicates the posterior probability of a tree.Upper case 'P' indicates the cumulative posterior probability.]begin trees;    translate        1     Chimpanzee,        2     Gibbon,        3     Gorilla,        4     Human,        5     Orangutan    ;    tree tree_1 [p = 0.971686] [P = 0.971686] = ((3,(5,2)),1,4);    tree tree_2 [p = 0.014990] [P = 0.986676] = ((5,2),(3,1),4);    tree tree_3 [p = 0.013324] [P = 1.000000] = (((5,2),1),3,4);end;```#### Consensus treeThis is the content of the file `primates.con`. The difference between the two trees is the information given as branch labels:* First tree: labels are bipartition frequencies (= posterior probability of bipartition, if tree samples are from Bayesian MCMC analysis)* Second tree: labels are the branchIDs also indicated in the bipartition summary in the file `primates.parts`. This should make it simpler to understand what branch the bipartition corresponds to (open the tree file in a treeviewer such as FigTree and view the branch labels).```#NEXUSbegin trees;   [In this tree branch labels indicate the posterior probability of the bipartition corresponding to the branch.]   tree prob = ((Orangutan:0.279279,(Gorilla:0.0728019,(Chimpanzee:0.0756054,Human:0.0568895)0.972:0.0367431)1.000:0.146428):0.0758066,Gibbon:0.355086);   [In this tree branch labels indicate the bipartition ID listed in the file primates.parts.

Note: input trees need to be based on a clock model for this to be meaningful. * `-b 0.25`: Discard 25% of tree samples as burn-in* `--meandepth`: set node depth for each clade to mean node depth observed for that specific, monophyletic clade among input trees (this is the same as `treeannotator -heights mean` in the BEAST2 package). Note: only meaningful when input trees are clock trees.* `-n`: Overwrite any existing output files with no warning* `-s`: Compute average standard deviation of clade frequencies as a measure of MCMC convergence* `--basename beast_summary`: produce output files with the indicated stem * `-i beastrun1.trees -i beastrun2.trees`: Summarise the tree samples in the files `beastrun1.trees` and `beastrun2.trees````sumt --mcc -b 0.25 --meandepth -ns --basename beast_summary -i beastrun1.trees -i beastrun2.trees ```### Example 6: #### Maximum bipartition credibility tree with common ancestor node depths, rooted at most frequent positionThe command below causes sumt to do the following:* `--mbc`: Compute maximum bipartition credibility tree* `-b 0.25`: Discard 25% of tree samples as burn-in* `--cadepth`: set node depth for each clade to mean node depth observed for MRCA of that clade among input trees (this is the same as `treeannotator -heights ca` in the BEAST2 package).

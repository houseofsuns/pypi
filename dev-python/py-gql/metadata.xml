It is however still in a fairly experimental phase and to reflect that versions are still in the `0.x.y`.The API is still subject to change as different part of the codebase are iterated on and are getting more use against production codebases.Development setup-----------------Make sure you are using Python 3.6+ (you can run the tests under 3.5 but `other development tasks such as black are not guaranteed to work).Clone this repo and create a virtualenv before installing the development dependencies:```bashgit clone git@github.com:lirsacc/py-gql.gitpython -m venv $WORKON_HOME/py-gql --copiespip install -U -r requirements-dev.txtpip install -e .```Development tasks are available through [invoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org/). Check [`tasks.py`](./tasks.py) or use `inv -l` to list all available tasks and `inv --help {TASK}` to get help on a specific task. Most of the tools used should be usable directly, but the tasks provide some common aliases and targets.As a shortcut, `inv check` will run all checks that are normally run on CI (lint, typecheck and tests).CI is done on [Github Actions](https://github.com/lirsacc/py-gql/actions).### Branches- The last tag should correspond to the latest release version- `master` contains unreleased changes that are planned to be released- `dev` is used for experimenting and hard changes such as rebase and force pushed should be expected. For now this is the branch I used in side projects and where most of the iteration happens.</longdescription>

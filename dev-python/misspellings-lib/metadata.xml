	<longdescription># misspelling## Spell checker for code&gt; This is a project originally imported/forked from the abandoned project https://github.com/lyda/misspell-checkThis is a Python library and tool to check for misspelled words insource code. It does this by looking for words from a list ofcommon misspellings. The dictionary it uses to do this is basedon the Wikipedia list of common misspellings.- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lists_of_common_misspellings/For_machinesThe list has been slightly modified to remove some changes thatcause a number of false positives. In particular `ok-&gt;OK` wasremoved (ok is frequently used in perl tests for instance).## Opinionated versionThis includes custom additions that should be considered opinionated, such ascancellation vs. cancelation. This is not recommended for anyone's use.## ContributionsContributions are welcome! Please add unit tests for new featuresor bug fixes. To run all the unit tests run `pytest tests/`.You can review `coverage` of added tests by running `pytest --cov=tests`.Note that tests are run on `GitHub Actions` for all supported python versions whenever the tree on GitHub is pushed to.The packaged version is available via `pip` or `easy_install` as `misspellings-lib`. The project page is on `pypi`:The source code is available in the following locations:- Bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/lyda/misspell-check/src- code.google: http://code.google.com/p/misspell-check/- Github: https://github.com/lyda/misspell-check- Gitorious: https://gitorious.org/uu/misspell-check- Sourceforge: https://sourceforge.net/p/misspell-check- Mazulo's GitHub: https://github.com/mazulo/misspellingPull requests on any of those platforms or emailed patches are fine.## To doSome items on the TODO list:- Implement option to interactively fix files.- Give some thought to supporting multiple languages?- Might a &quot;common misspellings&quot; list be different for different English  users - might an American make one set of mistakes while a German  writing English make another? Source of this data?- Fix sed flag. We need to have it support sed -i optionally, have it output all  unambiguous sed commands, have it be more careful on what it  replaces. It might also be an idea to have a perl output option.- Use generators to allow finding errors as you go. However, currently misspellings  grabs all files first, then checks them, which can take a while.- Lacking tests for misspellings cli.## Credits- `Kevin Lyda`: Initial shell goo and python version.- `Steven Myint`: Better python idioms and style. Mixed case support. Travis/tox support.- `Maciej Blizinski`: Potential use in `OpenCSW` pushed move to python.- `Ville Skyttä`: Sped up wordification, editor-friendly reporting.- `coverage`: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coverage- `Kevin Lyda`: https://github.com/lyda- `Steven Myint`: https://github.com/myint- `Maciej Blizinski`: https://github.com/automatthias- `Ville Skyttä`: https://github.com/scop- `pypi`: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/misspellings- `OpenCSW`: http://www.opencsw.org/</longdescription>

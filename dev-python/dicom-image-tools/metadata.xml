Adding functionality often used for programmatic image analysis.The package is still in early development and more features will be added.# Install Dicom Image ToolsInstall using pipenv by running:``$ pipenv install dicom-image-tools``Install using pip by running:``$ pip install dicom-image-tools``Only **Python 3.10+** is supported.See project wiki for more detailed documentation# UsageWhen you've installed the package you import it as any other package using  ```python import dicom_image_tools ``` ## Importing DICOM imagesThere are two functions for importing DICOM images, ``import_dicom_file(file: pathlib.Path)`` and ``import_dicom_from_folder(folder: pathlib.Path, recursively: bool = True)``.The latter function has an optional input argument for specifying if the folder given should be searched for DICOM files recursively, default = ``True`` Both will return the image/-s in ``DicomStudy`` objects, the ``import_dicom_from_folder`` function returns a dictionary with the _Study Instance UID_ as the _key_ and the corresponding ``DicomStudy`` object as _value_.You can then add additional files to the ``DicomStudy`` object through the ``DicomStudy.add_file`` which takes the file path as a ``pathlib.Path`` object as input.The ``DicomStudy.Series`` is a list of all series belonging to the study that has been imported. Each ``DicomStudy.Series`` item is an object containing the image/image volume and metadata for each image. The image/image volume is accessed through the ``ImageVolume`` attribute of the ``DicomStudy.Series`` item, and the metadata in the ``CompleteMetadata`` attribute.</longdescription>

It was created as an educational (self-educational) project in order to explain how does [HTTP/1.1](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Evolution_of_HTTP) works (I'm lying, it was to understand it).```pythonimport asynciofrom threadsnake.turbo import Application, HttpRequest, HttpResponseapp = Application(8080)@app.get('/')def main(app:Application, req:HttpRequest, res:HttpResponse):    res.end('Served by threadsnake!')asyncio.run(app.run())```_The previous example sets a server wich listens at port 8080 and responds to every get resquest to the path /_Threadsnake is designed to be lightweight and simple, yet able to serve hypertext and other resources sucessfully. Futhermore, as it was build over the [The Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/), it has no third party dependencies.## FeaturesAs I said, threadsnake is an academic project, not intended to be used as an fully production tool. However, it actually has some interesting capacities out of the box:* [Static files](https://dev.moradev.dev/threadsnake/examples/static_files)* [Session management](https://dev.moradev.dev/threadsnake/examples/session_management)* [Files upload and download](https://dev.moradev.dev/threadsnake/examples/files)* [Multipart-form data parsing](https://dev.moradev.dev/threadsnake/examples/body_parsing)* [Authorization parameters parsing](https://dev.moradev.dev/threadsnake/examples/authorization)...And much more. In fact, I'm compiling [a lot of examples](https://dev.moradev.dev/threadsnake/examples) in order to show how can you use all those options to make a feature-rich and fully functional web server.## Installing threadsnake### Installing through pipThe main way to get threadsnake is using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):    pip install threadsnakeIf you did it well, the [python package manager](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) will download and install threadsnake on your system. If not, well... That means something went wrong. Check [this link](https://dev.moradev.dev/threadsnake/installing_troubleshoot/pip) in order to solve the pip installation method. Those other links may be helpful:* [Installing packages](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/)* [Installing Python Modules](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html)### Downloading from PypiYes, i know it's redundant, but you always can go to [pypi](https://pypi.org/) and download the package [directly](https://pypi.org/project/threadsnake/#files) (The 'directly' part is the actual link to pypi. However, as all we know, we feel more comfortable by clicking the literal link, so, here you have it: [https://pypi.org/project/threadsnake/#files](https://pypi.org/project/threadsnake/#files)).### Downloading from the repository ...if still hereIf [Murphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law) is obsessed with you (Seriously, if you're still reading, it have to be true) and all the above fails, then you have no option than going to the repository at [github](https://github.com/LostSavannah/threadsnake).## Documentation and Issues Wow... You're still reading. You have to be some sort of... Anime Archetype. Well, as you can see right now we lack of a proper documentation. You have to understand, it's a new and small project. That said, once I finish uploading the examples, I'm planning to publish the [documentation in this link](https://dev.moradev.dev/threadsnake/documentation/) and the bugs tracking [to this other link](https://dev.moradev.dev/threadsnake/issues/). Till then... you know. Don't let your dreams be dreams.

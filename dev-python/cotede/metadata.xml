My goal is to minimize the burden on manual expert QC improving the consistency, performance, and reliability of the QC procedure for oceanographic data, especially for real-time operations.CoTeDe is the result from several generations of quality control systems that started in 2006 with real-time QC of TSGs and were later expanded for other platforms including CTDs, XBTs, gliders, and others.----------Why CoTeDe----------CoTeDe contains several QC procedures that can be easily combined in different ways:- Pre-set standard tests according to the recommendations by GTSPP, EGOOS, XBT, Argo or QARTOD;- Custom set of tests, including user defined thresholds;- Two different fuzzy logic approaches: as proposed by Timms et. al 2011 &amp; Morello et. al. 2014, and using usual defuzification by the bisector;- A novel approach based on Anomaly Detection, described by `Castelao 2021 &lt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2021.104803&gt;`_ (available since 2014 `&lt;http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02714&gt;`_).Each measuring platform is a different realm with its own procedures, metadata, and meaningful visualization. So CoTeDe focuses on providing a robust framework with the procedures and lets each application, and the user, to decide how to drive the QC.For instance, the `pySeabird package &lt;http://seabird.castelao.net&gt;`_ is another package that understands CTD and uses CoTeDe as a plugin to QC.-------------Documentation-------------A detailed documentation is available at http://cotede.readthedocs.org, while a collection of notebooks with examples is available athttp://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/castelao/CoTeDe/tree/master/docs/notebooks/--------Citation--------If you use CoTeDe, or replicate part of it, in your work/package, please consider including the reference:Castelão, G.

Inversion of roles to generalize CoTeDe for other uses. Before CoTeDe would depend on pySeabird, but now CoTeDe is an optional requirement for pySeabird to QC CTD and TSG.0.19----------------* CARS features and flags0.17 - Mar, 2016----------------* Implementing fuzzy procedures inside CoTeDe, thus removing dependency on scikit-fuzzy. scikit-fuzzy is broken, hence compromising tests and development of CoTeDe.0.16 - Mar, 2016----------------* Using external package `OceansDB &lt;https://github.com/castelao/oceansdb&gt;`_ to handle climatologies and bathymetry.0.15 - Dec, 2015----------------* Moved procedures to handle climatology to external standalone packages.0.14 - Aug, 2015----------------* Interface for human calibration of anomaly detection* Implemented fuzzy logic criteria0.13 - July, 2015-----------------* Major improvements in the anomaly detection submodule* Partial support to thermosalinographs (TSG)* Working on WOA test to generalize for profiles and tracks* Adding .json to default QC configuration filenames* Moved load_cfg from qc to utils0.12----Since 0.9 some of the most important changes.* Following OceanSites vocabulary for variable names (PRES, TEMP, PSAL...)* Partial support to Argo profiles* Added density invertion test* Included haversine to avoid dependency on MAUD.* tox and travis support.0.9 - Dec, 2013---------------* A few people already had access but at this point it went open publicly.0.7.3-----* Creating fProfileQC()0.5.4 - Nov, 2013-----------------* Including Tukey53H test0.5.0-----* Implemented ProfileQCCollection (later moved to PySeabird).0.4 - Sep, 2013---------------* Gradient and spike tests with depth conditional thresholds.* CruiseQC (later replaced by ProfileQCCollection).* Use default threshold values for the QC tests.0.1 - May 24, 2013------------------* Renamed to CoTeDe. Another major refactoring.QC_ML - 2011------------* Renamed to QC_ML, a machine learning approach to quality control hydrographic data, the initial prototype of Anomaly Detection approach. I refactored the system I developed to quality control TSG, to evaluate the PIRATA's CTD stations for INPE. At that point I migrated from my personal Subversion server to Bitbucket, and I lost the detailed history and logs before that. 2008----* Modified to parse Seabird CTDs so that the .cnv files could be directly QCed.2006----* A system to automaticaly quality control TSG data on realtime for AOML-NOAA. The data was handled in a PostgreSQL database, and only the traditional tests were applied, i.e. a sequence of binary tests (spike, gradient, valid position ...).</longdescription>

	<longdescription># pytorch_runstatsRunning/online statistics for PyTorch.[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pytorch-runstats/badge/?version=latest)](https://pytorch-runstats.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)`torch_runstats` implements memory-efficient online reductions on tensors. Notable features: - Arbitrary sample shapes beyond single scalars - Reduction over arbitrary dimensions of each sample - &quot;Batched&quot;/&quot;binned&quot; reduction into multiple running tallies using a per-sample bin index.   This can be useful, for example, in accumulating statistics over samples by some kind of &quot;type&quot; index or for accumulating statistics per-graph in a `pytorch_geometric`-like [batching scheme](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/batching.html). (This feature is similar to [`torch_scatter`](https://pytorch-scatter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions/scatter.html).) - Option to ignore NaN values with correct sample counting.**Note:** the implementations currently heavily uses in-place operations for peformance and memory efficiency. This probably doesn't play nice with the autograd engine — this is currently likely the wrong library for accumulating running statistics you want to backward through. (See [TorchMetrics](https://torchmetrics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for a possible alternative.)For more information, please see [the docs](https://pytorch-runstats.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).## Install`torch_runstats` requires PyTorch.The library can be installed from PyPI:```bash$ pip install torch_runstats```The latest development version of the code can also be installed from `git`:```bash$ git clone https://github.com/mir-group/pytorch_runstats```and install it by running```bash$ cd torch_runstats/$ pip install .```You can run the tests with```bash$ pytest tests/```## License`pytorch_runstats` is distributed under an [MIT license](LICENSE).</longdescription>

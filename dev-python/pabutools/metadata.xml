	<longdescription># pabutools---tools for participatory budgetingPabutools provides two submodules: **model** and **rules**. ## model Provides the classes representing voters, candidates and election instances.  - **Voter(id, sex=None, age=None, subunits=set())** with the following attributes:- id: unique ID of the voter,- sex: 'M' (male), 'F' (female) or None (no information),- age: a natural number or None (no information),- subunits: a set of strings (subunits which the voter belongs to).  - **Candidate(id, cost, name=None, subunit=None)** with the following attributes:- id: unique ID of the candidate,- cost: a natural number,- name: string or None (no information),- subunit: string or None (no information or a citywide project).  - **Election(name=None, voters=None, profile=None, budget=0, subunits = None)** with the following attributes:- voters: a set of Voter instances,- profile: a dict where keys are Candidate instances and values are dicts in which keys are Voter instances and values are natural numbers (voters' utilities over candidates; if a voter has utility 0, she can be skipped),- budget: a natural number,- subunits: a set of strings (subunits within the instance).and the following methods:- read_from_files(pattern): takes as an input the pattern of the filepaths of Pabulib files and fills the data of the newly created Election instance with them (e.g. calling Election().read_from_files('pabulib/poland_warszawa_2021*') will create a PB election out of all Pabulib files under the provided path starting with 'poland_warszawa_2021'). If the pattern fits more than one file, they should all be from the same country, unit and year. By default, approval utilities are considered to be binary.- cost_to_binary_utilities(): if the utilities are cost utilities, they are converted to binary- binary_to_cost_utilities(): if the utilities are binary, they are converted to cost utilities    - cost_to_score_utilities(): if the utilities are cost utilities, they are converted to score utilities- score_to_cost_utilities(): if the utilities are score utilities, they are converted to cost utilities ## rulesProvides the implementation of a number of voting rules for PB. All the methods take as an argument an election instance and return a set of elected candidates. - **utilitarian_greedy(e : Election)**: the simple greedy algorithm, - **phragmen(e : Election)**: the Phragmen's Sequential Method, - **equal_shares(e : Election, completion=None)**: the method of equal shares. The 'completion' parameter can take the following values: - None: no completion (default option). - 'binsearch': initial endowments of the voters are set to maximize the exhaustiveness of the elected committee with the use of binary search. - 'add1': initial endowments of the voters are increased similarly as above so that the committee is as exhaustive as possible; instead of using binary search, we keep increasing voters' endowments by 1 unit until the outcome is exhaustive or we exceed the original budget. - 'add1_utilitarian': similarly as in add1 completion, but if the outcome is still not exhaustive, it is completed by utilitarian greedy. - 'utilitarian_greedy': the completion with utilitarian_greedy. - 'phragmen': the completion with the Phragmen's Sequential Method. - 'eps': the completion by &quot;epsilon utilities&quot;</longdescription>

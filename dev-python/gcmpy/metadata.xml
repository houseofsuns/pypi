Random graph models providean excellent framework to integrate topology with dynamics. The topology of a network is crucial to the outcome of a dynamical process, such as an epidemic, occurring over a network.To create the networks, ``gcmpy`` creates a joint degree distribution object through a variety of analytical or empirical methods. Once constructed, this joint distribution is sampled to obtain a joint degree sequence. The joint sequence is then used in the GCM algorithm to create a networkx graph. It can also be used to create an edge list directly, which is significantly faster.There is also a tools library for obtaining useful quantities from the networkas well as converting a joint degree distribution into excess joint degree distributions and vice versa, for example. We also provide an MCMC rewiring algorithm to stochastically rewire a synthetic network's correlations structure to a  target joint excess joint degree distributions. Installation------------You can install ``gcmpy`` directly from PyPi using ``pip``:.. code-block:: bash   pip install gcmpyThe master distribution of ``gcmpy`` is hosted on GitHub. To obtain acopy, just clone the repo:.. code-block:: bash        git clone git@github.com:PeterStAndrews/gcmpy.git    cd gcmpy    python setup.py installThe unit tests can be discovered from the project root using .. code-block:: bash    python3 -m unittest discover -v -s test/ -p 'test_*.py'Documentation-------------API documentation for ``gcmpy`` is available on `ReadTheDocs &lt;https://peterstandrews-gcmpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`_Author and license------------------Copyright (c) 2021, Peter Mann &lt;pm78@st-andrews.ac.uk&gt;Licensed under the `GNU General Public License v2 or later (GPLv2+) &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html&gt;`_.</longdescription>

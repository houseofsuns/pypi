	<longdescription># RhythmRhythm allows you to design and control workflows made of Celery tasks. A workflow is a sequence of steps to run oneafter the other. Rhythm simplifies the process of executing workflows consisting of long-running tasks with reliability.The following are the features of Rhythm workflows:- If a workflow consisting of three steps (S1, S2, and S3) encounters a failure while executing S2 (even after retries  by Celery), it is possible to resume the workflow later. Resuming the workflow with restart S2 with previous arguments  and after its completion S3 will be run.- A workflow can be paused and resumed later.- You can keep track of which step is currently running, as well as its progress.### Installation```pip install sca-rhythm```see on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/sca-rhythm/)### PrerequisitesCelery app should be configured with a mongo database backend.### Create Tasks with `WorkflowTask` class```pythonimport osimport timefrom celery import Celeryfrom sca_rhythm import WorkflowTaskapp = Celery(&quot;tasks&quot;)@app.task(base=WorkflowTask, bind=True)def task1(self, batch_id, **kwargs):    print(f'task - {os.getpid()} 1 starts with {batch_id}')    # do work    time.sleep(1)    # update progress to result backend    # sets the task's state as &quot;PROGRESS&quot;    self.update_progress({        'done': 2873,        'total': 100000    })    # do some more work    return batch_id, {'return_obj': 'foo'}```#### :warning: Task Constraints :warning:1. The task signature must contain `**kwargs` for the workflow orchestration to function.2. The return type must be of list / tuple type and the first element of the return value is sent to the next task as   its argument.### Create Workflows with `Workflow` class```pythonfrom celery import Celeryfrom sca_rhythm import Workflowsteps = [    {        'name': 'inspect',        'task': 'tasks.inspect'    },    {        'name': 'archive',        'task': 'tasks.archive'    },    {        'name': 'stage',        'task': 'tasks.stage'    }]wf = Workflow(app, steps=steps, name='archive_batch')wf.start('batch-id-test')```### Pause and Resume WorkflowsPausing a workflow stop the current running task and resuming a workflow will restart the stopped task with the samearguments.```pythonwf = Workflow(app, workflow_id='2f87decb-a431-472b-b26e-32c894993881')wf.pause()wf.resume()```### Build &amp; Publish```bashpoetry installpoetry publish --build```### Task Status- PENDING: Task state is unknown (assumed pending since you know the id).- STARTED: Task was started by a worker (task_track_started = True)- SUCCESS: Task succeeded- FAILURE: Task failed- REVOKED: Task was revoked- RETRY: Task is waiting for retry.### Workflow StatusThe workflow status is a summative status that is determined by the status of the initial step that is not marked as &quot;SUCCESS,&quot; which is referred to as a &quot;pending step&quot;.- PENDING - the pending step is the first step in the workflow and its status is pending.- STARTED - the status of the pending step is one of STARTED, RETRY, PENDING.- REVOKED - the pending step was revoked, the workflow can be resumed.- FAILURE - the pending step was failed, the workflow can be resumed.- SUCCESS - all steps have succeeded.#### Status Groups:- DONE: { SUCCESS, FAILURE, REVOKED }- ACTIVE: !DONE</longdescription>

	<longdescription># Project OverviewThe CHART MagNum (Magnum Numerics) aims at introducing advanced design techniques in order to support the design process of superconducting accelerator magnet.The project responds to the following strategic goals:- Sustainability  Ensure that outstanding modeling work will have an impact on present or future designs. This also require that models have clearly defined scope and range of applicability.- Traceability  Ensure that the modeler is able to trace back the input parameters, code and script versions, etc., that have been used to produce a particular plot in a ppt or pdf.  Traceability is even more important in multi-scale and multi-model analysis.- Repeatability  Ensure that results presented at, e.g., a Conceptual Design Review can be reproduced at any later time.  Ensure that as-built models can be re-run at any moment during a potentially decades-long project life cycle.- Flexibility  Allow for different labs and collaborators to have/prefer different licenses.  Enable researchers to implement innovative ideas while building upon existing best practices, but without having to solve legacy issues.- Usability  Encapsulate the increased flexibility behind easy-to-use UIs for the standard design work.The project implements a number of concepts introduced by the MBSE (Model-Based System Engineering) methdology.In particular, MBSE shifts the focus from documents to models as primary means of communication in complex system design projects.</longdescription>

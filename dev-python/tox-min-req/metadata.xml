But `deps` and package are installed in two independent steps. So it means that some of dependencies could be upgraded or downgraded when installing package. The `PIP_CONSTRAINT` variable is used to pin the dependencies. And it will apply to call of `pip install` during dependency resolving. ## Installation```consolepip install tox-min-req```## License`tox-min-req` is distributed under the terms of the [MIT](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html) license.# UsageThe basic usage is to set the `MIN_REQ` environment variable to `1````bash$ MIN_REQ=1 tox -e py37```## Configuration optionsThe `tox-min-req` plugin allow to provide following environment configuration options:* `min_req` - set to `1` to enable the minimum requirements testing, could be used instead of environment variable.* `min_req_constraints` - list of additional constrains that will be used to generate the constrains file.    It could be useful in following scenarios:  * Some of dependencies in old version is incompatible with its dependencies in latest version. (see Known issues)  * Maintainers would like to test also some problematic dependencies in old version, but not oldest supported version.```ini[tox]envlist = py310[testenv]extras = testrecreate = Truecommands = pytest test_file.pymin_req = 1min_req_constraints=    coverage==6.5.0    babel==2.6.0    six==1.14.0    -r {project_dir}/constraints.txt```Please note that `-r {project_dir}/constraints.txt` will be put in generated constrains file, not parsed.# Known issues## Pinning only direct dependenciesAs this plugin parse only `setup.cfg` or `pyproject.toml` file, it is not possible to pin the indirect dependencies.To provide the indirect dependencies pinning, the `min_req_constraints` environment configuration option could be used.## Space in constrains file path`pip` is using the space as file path separator in `PIP_CONSTRAINT` variable. The plugin is storing the generated constrains file in the `.tox` temporary directory.If the path to the temporary directory contains space, the `pip` will not be able to find the constrains file.In such situation there is a need to set the `TOX_MIN_REQ_CONSTRAINTS` environment variableto the path where constrains file could be written.```bash$ TOX_MIN_REQ_CONSTRAINTS=/tmp MIN_REQ=1 tox -e py37```It is also possible to use the `--min-req-constraints-path` command line option to set the path to the constrains file.```bash$ tox --min-req-constraints-path=/tmp -e py37``` </longdescription>

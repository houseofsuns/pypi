If you need data access (e.g. to train your machine learning models),please contact [Markus Matiaschek](mailto:info@childgrowthmonitor.org) for details.If you have access to scan data, you can use: `cgmml/data_utils` to understand and visualize the data.## Repository structureThe source code is in `cgmml/`.Due to AzureML, all code for a single experiment run needs to reside in one directory.Example: All code for one specific training, e.g. a ResNet training, needs to be in this training directory.However, many of our trainings (and also evaluation runs) share large portions of code.In order to reduce code duplication, we copy shared(a.k.a. common) utility code with `copy_dir()` from `cgmml/common/` into the training/evaluation directory.This way, during the experiment run, the code is in the directory and can be used during the run.### Run linting / tests```bash# Make sure to be in the root dir of this repositoryflake8 cgmml/pytest```### Release cgm-ml-commonCommon functionalities of this repo are released on pypi: &lt;https://pypi.org/project/cgm-ml-common/&gt;To release a new version of cgm-ml-common:* Configure the version you wish to release in `setup.py`* Publish the release using the pipeline `.github/workflows/pypi-release.yml`## ContributingPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.## VersioningOur [releases](https://github.com/Welthungerhilfe/cgm-ml/releases) use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org).You can find a chronologically ordered list of notable changes in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).## LicenseThis project is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0.

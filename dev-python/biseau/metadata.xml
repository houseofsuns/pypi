	<longdescription># BiseauBuild by Input Some Easy ASP from User.Helps the exploration of formal structures by using ASP as a DSL for drawing graphs.For a Graphical User Interface, see the [biseau-gui](https://gitlab.inria.fr/lbourneu/biseau-gui) package.For the initial version of biseau published in the[FCA4AI'18 workshop](https://fca4ai.hse.ru/2018) at IJCAI,see [the archived repository biseau-initial](https://gitlab.inria.fr/lbourneu/biseau-initial)## PrinciplesNow, you may want to read about:- [visualization details](doc/user-doc.mkd#visualization-principles), that explains the theory behind the visualization itself.- [visualization DSL](doc/user-doc.mkd#asp-to-dot), that explains which atoms produces which effect in visualization.- [scripting](doc/user-doc.mkd#scripting), that allow you to implement new behavior for biseau.### Export as standalone scriptCurrently under development.## InstallationSee [user documentation](doc/user-doc.mkd#installation) for details,but in short, you need [clingo](https://potassco.org/clingo/),[graphviz](http://graphviz.org/) and `make install-deps`.Biseau and its gui are packaged, so if you already have clingo and graphviz, you should be good with:    pip install biseau biseau-gui## UsageSee [user documentation](doc/user-doc.mkd#basic-usage) for details.See [`Makefile`](Makefile) for various recipes.Running biseau can be done using the following commands:    python -m biseau gui     # run the Graphical User Interface (if biseau-gui is installed)    python -m biseau         # run the Command Line Interface    python -m biseau --help  # get help for the CLI# Notes### Bomb attack errorTo save you from some kind of attacks, Pillow may prevent you to create large images. To fix that, you can use something like:    from PIL import Image    Image.MAX_IMAGE_PIXELS = 20000  # or None, if you are feeling adventurous</longdescription>

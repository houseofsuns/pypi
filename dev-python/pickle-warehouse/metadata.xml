	<longdescription>Pickle Warehouse==================Pickle Warehouse makes it easy to save Pythonobjects to files with meaningful identifiers.How to use-------------------Pickle Warehouse provides a dictionary-like objectthat is associated with a particular directory onyour computer. ::    from pickle_warehouse import Warehouse    warehouse = Warehouse('/tmp/a-directory')The keys correspond to files, and the values getpickled to the files. ::    warehouse['filename'] = range(100)    import pickle    range(100) == pickle.load(open('/tmp/a-directory/filename', 'rb'))You can also read and delete things. ::    # Read    range(100) == warehouse['filename']    # Delete    del(warehouse['filename'])The coolest part is that the key gets interpretedin a fancy way. Aside from strings and string-like objects,you can use iterables of strings; all of these indices referto the file ``/tmp/a-directory/foo/bar/baz``::    warehouse[('foo','bar','baz')]    warehouse[['foo','bar','baz']]If you pass a relative path to a file, it will be broken up as you'd expect;that is, strings get split on slashes and backslashes. ::    warehouse['foo/bar/baz']    warehouse['foo\\bar\\baz']Note well: Specifying an absolute path won't save things outside the warehouse directory. ::    warehouse['/foo/bar/baz'] # -&gt; foo, bar, baz    warehouse['C:\\foo\\bar\\baz'] # -&gt; c, foo, bar, baz                                   # (lowercase &quot;c&quot;)If you pass a URL, it will also get broken up in a reasonable way. ::    # /tmp/a-directory/http/thomaslevine.com/!/?foo=bar#baz    warehouse['http://thomaslevine.com/!/?foo=bar#baz']    # /tmp/a-directory/thomaslevine.com/!?foo=bar#baz    warehouse['thomaslevine.com/!?foo=bar#baz']Dates and datetimes get converted to :code:`YYYY-MM-DD` format. ::    import datetime    # /tmp/a-directory/2014-02-26    warehouse[datetime.date(2014,2,26)]    warehouse[datetime.datetime(2014,2,26,13,6,42)]And you can mix these formats! ::    # /tmp/a-directory/http/thomaslevine.com/open-data/2014-02-26    warehouse[('http://thomaslevine.com/open-data', datetime.date(2014,2,26))]It also has typical dictionary methods like :code:`keys`, :code:`values`, :code:`items`,and :code:`update`.When to use----------------pickle-warehouse is for when you want a persistant store of Python objects.If you want an in-memory pickle store, look at_pickleDB: https://pythonhosted.org/pickleDB/.Pickle Warehouse is strictly better than Mongo, so you should use it anywherewhere you were previously using Mongo. Pickle Warehouse is designed forwrite-heavy workloads that need scalability (easy sharding), traditionaldatabase reliability (ACID), flexible schemas, and highly configurable indexing.Pickle Warehouse is acidic----------------------------Here's how it accomplishes that.Atomicity    Writes are made to a temporary file that gets renamed.Consistency    I don't get this one, but I'm pretty sure I have it.Isolation    Simultaneous writes are handled quite cleanly. If reads occur during writes, an error gets thrown, and you can try again.Durability    All data are saved to disk right away.Mongo replacement feature checklist----------------------------------------* Call fsync twice, just to make sure.* Schema validation on read and write (configurable), because who knows what you did yesterday or whether you change your mind later?* PID + random number (+ hash?) for random number generation* Inode exhaustion</longdescription>

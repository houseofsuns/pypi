	<longdescription># SliderSlide overlay software based on beamer and inkscape. This project is currently used in DTU coursebox. You can find a self-contained video guide here: - Youtube link: https://youtu.be/EoNZMX3QOnU - Gitlab link to example: https://gitlab.compute.dtu.dk/tuhe/slider/-/blob/main/examples/video/index.pdf## What it doesSlider allows you to combine free-hand drawing with a standard LaTeX beamer slideshow. It allows you to insert a special `\osvg{label}` tag in your beamer slides:```latex\begin{frame}\osvg{label}Various standard latex stuff\end{frame}```Then by running the `slider` command (see below) this will automatically create a transparent `.svg` file placed &quot;above&quot; the LaTeX contents which allows you to do free-hand drawing. While you could do this manually, slider has the advantage it maintains the **LaTeX** contents as a non-editable background layer in the `.svg` file so you can do absolute positioning etc. Naturally, you can insert new `\osvg` tags (and keep them updated) at any point by just running the `slider` command. ### Install:Simple pip-install the package and you should be all set.```terminalpip install beamer-slider```You can import the package using `import slider`. # Use and examplesGo to an empty directory where you want to start a slideshow and run the command:```terminalpython -m slider index.tex```This will start a small beamer project and populate it with the (few) necesary files to make the framework work. You can see the generated files in the `/examples/new_project` folder. The main `LaTeX` file looks like this:```latex \documentclass[aspectratio=43]{beamer}\usepackage{etoolbox}\newtoggle{overlabel_includesvgs}\newtoggle{overlabel_includelabels}\toggletrue{overlabel_includesvgs}\toggletrue{overlabel_includelabels}\input{beamer_slider_preamble.tex}\title{Example slide show}\author{Tue Herlau}\begin{document}\begin{frame}\maketitle\end{frame}\begin{frame}\osvg{myoverlay} % Use the \osvg{labelname} - tag to create new overlays. Run slider and check the ./osvgs directory for the svg files!\title{Slide with an overlay}This is some example text!\end{frame}\end{document}```And the generated PDF file looks like this:![alt text|small](https://gitlab.compute.dtu.dk/tuhe/slider/-/raw/main/docs/new_project_nup.png)Don't worry about the label in the upper-left corner: you can just turn it off with the LaTeX switch.Next, go to the `osvgs` folder. It will contain an image called `myoverlay.svg` (remember this was our label name).![alt text|small](https://gitlab.compute.dtu.dk/tuhe/slider/-/raw/main/docs/inkscape.png)At the start, this file contains all the LaTeX contents as editable `svg` contents which we can move around (for instance by rotating the text), and we can add free-hand drawings to the slide. The bottom layer of the image will always be a non-editable layer containing the **actual** LaTeX content of the slide (in this case the logo and text). You can use this for reference when you edit. When you are happy, simply save the file and re-run ```terminalpython -m slider index.tex```(it will automatically try to detect the `index.tex` if run without arguments). This will keep all layers up to date, flatten fonts and generally just make sure everything is okay. You can find the output in the `examples/basic1` folder and the `pdf` file will now look as follows:![alt text|small](https://gitlab.compute.dtu.dk/tuhe/slider/-/raw/main/docs/basic1_nup.png)Thats is! And since this is an overlay, you are free to add more LaTeX to the slide or contents to the `svg` and as long as you run `slider`, the `.svg` images will be kept up to date.## Additional features- You can add new overlays at any point by inserting a '\osvg{my_label}' command in your LaTeX document- Overlay-images with multiple layers are automatically converted into '\pause'-frames in LaTeX## Citing```bibtex@online{beamer_slider,title={Beamer-slider (0.1.7): \texttt{pip install beamer-slider}},url={https://lab.compute.dtu.dk/tuhe/slider},urldate = {2021-09-08}, month={9},publisher={Technical University of Denmark (DTU)},author={Tue Herlau},year={2021},}```</longdescription>

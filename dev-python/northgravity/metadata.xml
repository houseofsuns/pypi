	<longdescription># NORTH GRAVITY PYTHON SDK #This document describes the North Gravity Python SDK which enables external users to use the North Gravity platform tools within their Python scripts. The Python SDK can be used within:- a single Python script that is ran thanks to the Python Runner task within a pipeline in the North Gravity application- a single Jupyter Notebook that is ran thanks to the Jupyter Runner task within a pipeline in the North Gravity application- an ensemble of Python scripts that are part of a container, for a Task created by the user, used in a pipeline in the North Gravity application**Examples of usage can be found at the bottom of the documentation.** Note that the SDK does not cover everything from API documentation but rather commonly used features.The scope of the SDK:- **Datalake Handler** - downloading / uploading / reading files from the data lake  - **Status Handler** - sending statuses about the task run  - **Task Handler** - enables communication between tasks within a pipeline and reading/writing parameters - **Time Series Handler** - retrieves data directly from the time series database# How to install and set the package: ## Install```textpip3 install northgravity==0.1.13```As the library is available from pip, it can be installed as a specific version within a Python Task from within requirements.txt just by adding:```textnorthgravity==0.1.13```The package relies on the requests library so, in the project, the user must install this library in the requirements.txt file.```textpip3 install requests```## Environment VariablesThe package uses information from the environment variables. They are automatically provided when running a script within a pipeline (as a Task or within the Python/Jupyter Runners).If running locally the script, users must set them in the project to be able to run the project locally. Mandatory environment variables to set:- LOGIN → login received from North Gravity- PASSWORD → password to log in. Credentials are used to generate the token so that each request is authenticated.- NG_API_ENDPOINT → the URL to the North Gravity platform API (by default, the url is set to https://api.northgravity.com) This allows to pass the authentication process and directs users' requests to the North Gravity environment API.Alternatively, instead of the LOGIN and PASSWORD, you may set NG_API_KEY environment variable with an API key generated within the North Gravity platform to enable the authentication process.Other variables may be useful when creating the tasks within the platform:- NG_STATUS_GROUP_NAME → the group on the data lake where the pipeline is located, and is used to display the statuses- JOBID → any value; when the pipeline is executed, this value is set by the North Gravity platform- PIPELINE_ID → any value; when the pipeline is created, this value is set by the North Gravity platform --- - # Datalake Handler## How to download or read a file from data lake by its name ?The DatalakeHandler class can be used as follow within a script to download or upload a file:```pythonimport northgravity as ngimport pandas as pd# Instantiate the Datalake Handlerdh = ng.DatalakeHandler()# download file from data lake with name and group name# it will be saved locally with name local_name.csvdh.download_by_name(file_name='my_file.csv',                     group_name='My Group',                     file_type='SOURCE',                    dest_file_name='folder/local_name.csv',                    save=True,                    unzip=False)# OR read file from data lake with name and group name# it returns a BytesIO object (kept in the RAM, not saved in the disk)fileIO = dh.download_by_name(file_name='my_file.csv',                             group_name='My Group',                            file_type='SOURCE',                            dest_file_name=None,                            save=False,                            unzip=False)# read the object as pandas DataFramedf = pd.read_csv(fileIO)```The download methods allows to either:- download and save locally the wanted file, if *save=True*- read the file directly from the datalake and get a BytesIO object (kept in memory only, that can for example be read by pandas as a dataframe directly)Note that by default:- the file is NOT saved locally, but returned as a BytesIO object (streamed from the datalake).- the argument *dest_file_name=None*, which will save the downloaded file to the root folder with its original name.## How to download or read a file from data lake by its ID ?In the case that the file ID is known, it can be directly downloaded/read as follow:```pythonimport northgravity as ngimport pandas as pd# Instantiate the Datalake Handlerdh = ng.DatalakeHandler()# download file from data lake by its ID# it will be saved locally with name local_name.csvdh.download_by_id(file_id='XXXX-XXXX',                   dest_file_name='folder/local_name.csv',                  save=True,                  unzip=False)# read file from data lake by its ID# it returns a BytesIO objectfileIO = dh.download_by_id(file_id='XXXX-XXXX',                             dest_file_name=None,                            save=False,                            unzip=False)# read the object as pandas DataFramedf = pd.read_csv(fileIO)```The download methods allows to either:- download and save locally the wanted file, if *save=True*- read the file directly from the datalake and get a BytesIO object (kept in memory only, that can for example be read by pandas as a dataframe directly)Note that by default:- the file is NOT saved locally, but returned as a BytesIO object (streamed from the datalake).- the argument *dest_file_name=None*, which will save the downloaded file to the root folder with its original name.## How to upload a file to the data lake?The uploading method will upload to the given group the file at the specified path, and returns its ID on the lake:```pythonimport northgravity as ng# Instantiate the Datalake Handlerdh = ng.DatalakeHandler()# upload file to data lakefile_id = dh.upload_file(file='path/local_name.csv',                         group_name='My Group',                         file_upload_name='name_in_the_datalake.csv')```It is possible as well to stream a python object's content directly to the datalake from memory, without having to save the file on the disk.The prerequisite is to pass to the uploading method a BytesIO object (not other objects such as pandas Dataframe).```pythonimport northgravity as ngimport io# Instantiate the Datalake Handlerdh = ng.DatalakeHandler()# Turn the pandas DataFrame (df) to BytesIO for streamingfileIO = io.BytesIO(df.to_csv().encode()) # upload file to data lakefile_id = dh.upload_file(file=fileIO,                         group_name='My Group',                         file_upload_name='name_in_the_datalake.csv')```--- -# Timeseries Queries## How to get the list of existing symbols for a given group ?Data saved in the time series database is structured by group, keys and timestamp.Each set of keys has unique dates entries in the database, with corresponding columns values.To explore what are the available symbols for a given group, the following method can be used:```pythonimport northgravity as ng# Instantiate Timeseries classts = ng.Timeseries()# Get the list of symbols for given groupgroup = 'My Group'group_symbols = ts.get_symbols(group_name=group)```The default size of the returned list is 1 000 items.Note that the return object from the get_symbols() method is a JSON (python dict) where the keys and columns are accessible in the *items* key of the JSON.## How to query by metadata or descriptions?In order to find the symbols querying by the metadata, column or symbol names, search_for parameter may be used.It will look for passed string in the whole time series database and return the JSON with keys and columns where searched string appears.```pythonimport northgravity as ng# Instantiate Timeseries classts = ng.Timeseries()# Get the list of symbols for given groupsearch = 'Data description'searched_symbols = ts.get_symbols(search_for=search)```Passing both group_name and search_for parameters of the get_symbols() method allows to narrow down the results from selected group.The user must provide either group_name or search_for to the method in order to obtain the symbols.If trying to get the list of symbols from a group that contains more than 1 000 items, the results will be paginated (by default into chunks of 1 000 items).To navigate in the large results the *get_symbols()* method takes as extra arguments the size of the returned list and the from page:```pythonimport northgravity as ng# Instantiate Timeseries classts = ng.Timeseries()# Get the list of symbols for given groupgroup = 'My Group'# Get the results into chunks of 200 items for page 5# meaning the results from the 1000th till the 1200th group_symbols = ts.get_symbols(group_name=group, _size=200, _from=5)```By default, these parameters are _size=2000 (the maximum limit for the items lengths) and _from=0.## How to read data from Timeseries database?It is possible to use the SDK to directly query the TimeSeries database for data, given the symbol's keys, columns and the datalake group it is stored on.On the application, it is similar of creating a Dataprep instance, that selects a set of symbols from groups into a basket. The retrieved data can be:- streamed directly to memory, retrieved as a BytesIO object, by setting *file_name* as None (default value), - saved as a csv file locally with the provided path and name as *file_name*.The symbols are the keys the data was saved with in the database. For a given symbol, all the keys must be passed, as a dictionary object with the key name and value.It is possible to use a wildcard for the symbols values, to have all the values for that key, using *.The wanted columns are then passed as a list that can contain one or more items.If an empty list [ ] is passed to the function, it returns all the available columns.To read all available data for specific symbols and columns with no time frame, no start or end date are passed to the method.Extra settings are as well available to query data:- Metadata: to either return it in the query of not- Format: either get a Normalized CSV (NCSV) or a dataframe format- Timezone: get the timestamps in the timezone of the user's account or get the data in a specific timezone- Corrections: how to handle corrections to the TimeSeries database (corrections set to 'yes', 'no', 'history' or 'only')- Delta: whether to show by datatimestamp file (delta=False) or insert time (delta=True)The following code shows an example of how to query the TimseSeries database: : ```pythonimport northgravity as ngimport pandas as pd# Instantiate Timeseries classts = ng.Timeseries()# Symbols to query from databasesymbols = {'Key1': &quot;Val1&quot;, &quot;Key2&quot;: &quot;Val2&quot;}columns = ['Open', 'Close']# retrieve all available data from group acccording to keys &amp; columns # and save as query.csv in test/ts.retrieve_data_as_csv(file_name='test/query.csv',                        symbols=symbols,                        columns=columns,                        group_name='My Group'                        )# The retrieved data can be read as a pandas dataframedf = pd.read_csv(&quot;test/query.csv&quot;)# retrieve all available data from group acccording to keys &amp; columns # and stream to memory as BytesIO objectfileIO = ts.retrieve_data_as_csv(file_name=None,                                 symbols=symbols,                                 columns=columns,                                 group_name='My Group'                                 )# read as pandas dataframedf = pd.read_csv(fileIO)```## How to read data from Timeseries for specific dates?To retrieve data the data within specific time frame, user can specify the start and end date.There are two options how the start and end date may look like:- only date (e.g., 2021-01-04)- date and time (e.g., 2021-02-01T12:00:00; ISO format must be followed)For example, if user specified start_date=2021-02-01 and end_date=2021-02-06, then data will be retrieved like this: from 2021-02-01 00:00:00 till 2021-02-06 23:59:59.If date and time is specified then data will be retrieved exactly for the specified time frame.Note that ISO format must be followed: YYYY-MM-DD**T**HH:mm:ss. Pay attention to the &quot;T&quot; letter between date and time. ```pythonimport northgravity as ngimport pandas as pd# Instantiate Timeseries classts = ng.Timeseries()# Symbols to query from databasesymbols = {'Key1': &quot;Val1&quot;, &quot;Key2&quot;: &quot;Val2&quot;}columns = 'Open'# retrieve data between start_date and end_date# data will be retrieved between 2021-01-04 00:00:00 and 2021-02-05 23:59:59# saved as a csv file named test.csvts.retrieve_data_as_csv(file_name='test/test.csv',                        symbols=symbols,                        columns=columns,                        group_name='My Group',                        start_date='2021-01-04',                        end_date='2021-02-05'                        )# retrieve data for specific time frame# from 2021-01-04 12:30:00# to 2021-02-05 09:15:00ts.retrieve_data_as_csv(file_name='test/test.csv',                        symbols=symbols,                        columns=columns,                        group_name='My Group',                        start_date='2021-01-04T12:30:00',                        end_date='2021-02-05T09:15:00'                        )# For given keys, columns, group and dates range# Streaming instead of savingfileIO = ts.retrieve_data_as_csv(file_name=None,                                 symbols=symbols,                                 columns=columns,                                 group_name='My Group',                                 start_date='2021-01-04',                                 end_date='2021-02-05'                                 )# read as pandas dataframedf = pd.read_csv(fileIO)```## How to use a wildcard for a key's values ?To get all the value for one a several keys for the query, the character * can be used as a wildcard.The argument *allow_wildcard* should be set to True in the retrieval function to enable the use of wildcard. Please note that by default, the use of wildcards is **DISABLED**.```pythonimport northgravity as ngimport pandas as pd# Instantiate Timeseries classts = ng.Timeseries()# Symbols to query from databasesymbols = {'Key1': &quot;Val1&quot;, &quot;Key2&quot;: &quot;Val2&quot;, &quot;Key3&quot;: &quot;*&quot;}columns = ['Open', 'Close']# retrieve all history for the symbols with keys and columns# all values for Key3 will be returned# the data will be streamed to memoryfileIO = ts.retrieve_data_as_csv(file_name=None,                                 symbols=symbols,                                 columns=columns,                                 group_name='My Group',                                 allow_wildcard=True                                 )# read as pandas dataframedf = pd.read_csv(fileIO)```## How to get all the columns for a given set of keys ?To get all the columns values for a given set of keys in the database, the query can take an empty list as the queried columns, as follow:```pythonimport northgravity as ngimport pandas as pd# Instantiate Timeseries classts = ng.Timeseries()# Symbols to query from databasesymbols = {'Key1': &quot;Val1&quot;, &quot;Key2&quot;: &quot;Val2&quot;, &quot;Key3&quot;: &quot;Val3&quot;}columns = []# retrieve all history for the symbols with keys and columns# all columns for the set of keys will be returned# the data will be streamed to memoryfileIO = ts.retrieve_data_as_csv(file_name=None,                                 symbols=symbols,                                 columns=columns,                                 group_name='My Group'                                 )# read as pandas dataframedf = pd.read_csv(fileIO)```Note that this configuration can be used with keys wildcards (with *allow_wildacrd=True*) and any other setting.## How to modify the Time Zone of the data ?The timestamps in the queried time series are set by default in the timezone of the user's account, who created the script or the pipeline.It is described in the Date column header between brackets (for example *Date(UTC)*)To modify the time zone in the retrieved dataset, the timezone can be passed directly to the retrieval function as follow.It must respect the Continent/City format.```pythonimport northgravity as ngimport pandas as pd# Instantiate Timeseries classts = ng.Timeseries()# Symbols to query from databasesymbols = {'Key1': &quot;Val1&quot;, &quot;Key2&quot;: &quot;Val2&quot;}columns = ['Open', 'Close']# retrieve all available data from group according to keys &amp; columns # and stream to memory as BytesIO objectfileIO = ts.retrieve_data_as_csv(file_name=None,                                 symbols=symbols,                                 columns=columns,                                 group_name='My Group',                                 timezone='Europe/London'                                 )# read as pandas dataframedf = pd.read_csv(fileIO)```## How to get the metadata along with the data ? It is possible to get extra columns in the retrieved data, along with the keys &amp; columns values, containing the metadata of the symbols.It is done by setting the argument *metadata=True* in the retrieval function.By default, no metadata is included in the queried data.```pythonimport northgravity as ngimport pandas as pd# Instantiate Timeseries classts = ng.Timeseries()# Symbols to query from databasesymbols = {'Key1': &quot;Val1&quot;, &quot;Key2&quot;: &quot;Val2&quot;}columns = ['Open', 'Close']# retrieve all available data from group according to keys &amp; columns # and stream to memory as BytesIO objectfileIO = ts.retrieve_data_as_csv(file_name=None,                                 symbols=symbols,                                 columns=columns,                                 group_name='My Group',                                 metadata=True                                 )# read as pandas dataframedf = pd.read_csv(fileIO)```## How to modify the format of the received data ?The queried data comes by default as Normalized CSV format (NCSV), with in this order:* the keys columns,* the date column, with timestamps in either the default timezone or the specified one (*timezone* argument in the function),* the values columns,* the metadata columns, if wanted (*metadata=True*) By setting *NCSV=False* in the retrieval method, the data will be returned as Dataframe format (PANDAS in API docs), as a JSON.The JSON (python dict) has timestamps as keys and a dictionary containing pairs of symbols_columns and their value.```pythonimport northgravity as ngimport pandas as pd# Instantiate Timeseries classts = ng.Timeseries()# Symbols to query from databasesymbols = {'Key1': &quot;Val1&quot;, &quot;Key2&quot;: &quot;Val2&quot;}columns = ['Open', 'Close']# retrieve all available data from group according to keys &amp; columns # and stream to memory as BytesIO objectfile_json = ts.retrieve_data_as_csv(file_name=None,                                    symbols=symbols,                                    columns=columns,                                    group_name='My Group',                                    metadata=True,                                    NCSV=False                                    )# read as pandas dataframe# Transpose to have datetime as rows indexdf = pd.DataFrame(file_json).T```Note that the dataframe, created from the JSON containing the data, is then transposed to have timestamps as DatetimeIndex (along rows axis). --- - # Task HandlerUsers can extend the existing set of tasks on North Gravity platform by executing scripts or notebooks respectively from the Python Runner Task or the Jupyter Runner Task. This task then can be used in a pipeline and be able to communicate with other tasks by:- reading outputs from other tasks, as inputs- writing outputs, that can be used by others tasks as inputsA task can as well receive inputs directly as a file picked from the datalake, either for a specific file either for the newest available version of a file on the lake, given its name and group.Whithin a python script, run into either one of the **Python Runner Task**,  this is implemented as follow:## Read a Task InputThe input file passed to the Task can be: - either downloaded to the disk,- either to be read on the fly (useful when limited space on the disk but not in memory). ```pythonimport northgravity as ngimport pandas as pd# Instantiate TaskHandler classth = ng.TaskHandler()# the current task reads the file passed by a previous task, that is connected to it.# The passed file is downloaded and saved on the disk as data.csvth.download_from_input_parameter(arg_name='Input #1',                                  dest_file_name='data.csv',                                 save=True)# The passed file is downloaded and kept in the memory (streamed, not saved on the disk)file_content = th.download_from_input_parameter(arg_name='Input #2',                                                 dest_file_name=None,                                                save=False)# If a csv file was streamed, it can be read as pandas Dataframe for exampledf = pd.read_csv(file_content)```If dest_file_name=None then the file is saved on the disk with its original name from the datalake.## How to obtain additional file informationThere is a possibility to retrieve information related to the input parameters using the DatalakeHandler (```dh.get_info_from_id()```) and TaskHandler (``` th.read_task_parameter_value()```) together.```pythonimport northgravity as ngimport pandas as pd# Instantiate TaskHandler classth = ng.TaskHandler()# Instantiate the Datalake Handlerdh = ng.DatalakeHandler()dh.get_info_from_id(th.read_task_parameter_value('Input #1'))``` This can be used to retrieve any metadata associated with the file itself like file name or arrival time (time it was uploaded to the system)## Set a Task OutputThe output of the Task can be set :- either by uploading a file saved on the disk to the datalake,- either by streaming the python object content to the datalake as the destination file.Once uploaded, the Output is set to point to the file on the datalake (by its ID, name ,group name) ```pythonimport northgravity as ngimport io# Instantiate TaskHandler classth = ng.TaskHandler()# the first task uploads the file dataset.csv to My Final Group and pass the info about this file# so that the next task can read this file by connecting its input to the output Prepared Datasetth.upload_to_output_parameter(output_name='Output #1',                               file='path/dataset.csv',                               group_name='My Final Group',                              file_upload_name=None,                              file_type='SOURCE')# Convert the python object to upload as BytesIO objectdf_io = io.BytesIO(df.to_csv().encode())# Stream to the datalake as the destination fileth.upload_to_output_parameter(output_name='Output #1',                               file=df_io,                               group_name='My Final Group',                              file_upload_name='dataset.csv',                              file_type='SOURCE')```If file_upload_name=None then the saved file will be uploaded with its original name.If the file is streamed directly to the datalake, the file_upload_name argument must be set.--- -# StatusesSending status can be used to show in the application what is the progress of the task execution. It allows to use 3 different levels: - FINISHED (green),- WARNING (orange), - ERROR (red).Sending statuses remains optional as the North Gravity platform sends general statuses.Only if user needs to pass some specific information in the status, this is worth using.```pythonimport northgravity as ng# Instantiate the Status Handlersh = ng.StatusHandler()# Generic status sendersh.send_status(status='INFO', message='Crucial Information')# there are pre-defined statusessh.info(message='Pipeline Finished Successfully')sh.warn(message='Something suspicious is happening ...')sh.error(message='Oops, the task failed ...')```Note that the info status is informing the status service that the task executed successfully and is finished.There is also a possibility to send a warning status with a custom warning message under some circumstances and immediately stop the execution of the pipeline.```pythonfrom northgravity.ExceptionHandler import PythonStepWarnExceptioni=1if i&gt;1:    raise PythonStepWarnException(message='The value of i is bigger than 1! Stopping pipeline execution.')```--- -# Example 1 - OOPTo simplify the use of the SDK methods in a script, Python SDK methods can be inherited by the user’s main class. Below is an example of a class that has 3 methods:- Download raw data (or take from the previous task)- Process the data  - Upload the data to datalake and pass it to the next task ```pythonimport ioimport northgravity as ngimport pandas as pdclass Runner:    def __init__(self):        # Inherit the methods from the SDK Task Handler class        self.handler = ng.TaskHandler()        self.df = None            def download_data(self):        # the method from TaskHandler can be used directly        # it downloads the file passed as input Dataset and save it as data.csv        self.handler.download_from_input_parameter(arg_name='Dataset', dest_file_name='data.csv', save=True)                # Read as pandas dataframe        return pd.read_csv(&quot;data.csv&quot;)                def process_data(self, df):        # any logic here that processed the downloaded dataset and saves it as processed_data.csv                return df_processed        def upload_data(self, df_processed):        # Encode as bytesIO        fileIO = io.BytesIO(df_processed.to_csv().encode())                # pass the processed data csv file as the output of the task called Processed Data        self.handler.upload_to_output_parameter(output_name='Processed Dataset', file=fileIO, group_name='Final Group')                def run(self):        df = self.download_data()        df_processed = self.process_data(df)        self.upload_data(df_processed)                if __name__ == '__main__':    status = ng.StatusHandler()    Runner().run()    status.info('Test Pipeline Finished') ```# Example 2 - functional programmingThe SDK methods may be used in functional programming simple scripts.Below is an example of a script that:- Downloads the data from Input #1- Processes the data- Uploads the data to datalake and passes it to the next task ```python#### #This part consists of local running setup for development and testing purposes.# It is not needed when running on the northgravity platform, since those variables are available in the platform's environmentimport os# login and password to the northgravity application for authentication os.environ['LOGIN'] = ''os.environ['PASSWORD'] = ''# filename and name of the DataLake group to download the data fromos.environ['Input #1'] = &quot;{'name':'', 'groupName':''}&quot;# the DataLake group to save the file to# on the platform defaults to the group where the pipeline running the script is savedos.environ['NG_STATUS_GROUP_NAME'] = ''# specify the api endpoint to northgravity applicationos.environ['NG_API_ENDPOINT'] = ''#### import os, sysimport ioimport northgravity as ngimport pandas as pd# loggingimport logging ; logging.basicConfig(stream=sys.stdout, level=logging.DEBUG)log = logging.getLogger()# initialize taskhandler from the Python SDK to communicate between pipeline tasksth = ng.TaskHandler()# download data from Input #1 of the task (Python Runner)df_io = th.download_from_input_parameter('Input #1')df = pd.read_csv(df_io)log.info('Data from Input #1 downloaded.')# your code heredf_processed = your_processing_function(df)# stream the dataframe as the Bytes IO file (does not save the csv to disc)file_io = io.BytesIO(df_processed.to_csv(index=False).encode())# upload the file to Output #1 of the taskth.upload_to_output_parameter(output_name='Output #1',                                        file=file_io,                                        # add your file name here                                        file_upload_name='',                                        # the group name defaults to the pipeline group                                        # you can also use it explicitly: group_name='Name of The Group on Datalake'                                        group_name=os.environ.get('NG_STATUS_GROUP_NAME'),                                        # the dataframe is saved as a flat file                                        # use file_type='NCSV' to save NCSV-type datasets into Timeseries database                                        file_type='SOURCE')```## Who do I talk to? ##* Admin: NorthGravity info@northgravity.com</longdescription>

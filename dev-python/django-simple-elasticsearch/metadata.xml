	<longdescription>===========================Django Simple Elasticsearch===========================.. image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/django-simple-elasticsearch.png  :target: http://badge.fury.io/py/django-simple-elasticsearch.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/jaddison/django-simple-elasticsearch.png  :target: https://travis-ci.org/jaddison/django-simple-elasticsearch.. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/jaddison/django-simple-elasticsearch/badge.png  :target: https://coveralls.io/r/jaddison/django-simple-elasticsearchThis package provides a simple method of creating Elasticsearch indexes forDjango models.-----Versions--------Branch :code:`master` targets both Elasticsearch 2.x and 5.x and will receive newfeatures. Both `elasticsearch-py` 2.x and 5.x Python modules are currentlysupported. `Documentation &lt;http://django-simple-elasticsearch.readthedocs.io/&gt;`_Branch :code:`1.x` is the maintenance branch for the legacy 0.9.x versioned releases,which targeted Elasticsearch versions less than 2.0. This branch is unlikely toreceive new features, but will receive required fixes.`Documentation &lt;http://django-simple-elasticsearch.readthedocs.io/en/1.x/&gt;`_**Using a version older than 0.9.0? Please be aware that as of v0.9.0, this packagehas changed in a backwards-incompatible manner. Version 0.5 is deprecated and nolonger maintained.**-----Documentation-------------Visit the `django-simple-elasticsearch documentation on ReadTheDocs &lt;http://django-simple-elasticsearch.readthedocs.org/&gt;`_.Features--------* class mixin with a set of :code:`@classmethods` used to handle: * type mapping definition * individual object indexing and deletion * bulk object indexing * model signal handlers for pre/post_save and pre/post_delete (optional)* management command to handle index/type mapping initialization and bulk indexing * uses Elasticsearch aliases to ease the burden of re-indexing* small set of Django classes and functions to help deal with Elasticsearch querying * base search form class to handle input validation, query preparation and response handling * multi-search processor class to batch multiple Elasticsearch queries via :code:`_msearch` * 'get' shortcut functions* post index create/rebuild signals available to perform actions after certain stages (ie. add your own percolators)Installation------------At the command line::    $ easy_install django-simple-elasticsearchOr::    $ pip install django-simple-elasticsearchConfiguring-----------Add the simple_elasticsearch application to your INSTALLED_APPS list::    INSTALLED_APPS = (        ...        'simple_elasticsearch',    )Add any models to `ELASTICSEARCH_TYPE_CLASSES` setting for indexing using **es_manage** management command::    ELASTICSEARCH_TYPE_CLASSES = [        'blog.models.BlogPost'    ]License-------**django-simple-elasticsearch** is licensed as free software under the BSD license.Todo----* Review search classes - simplify functionality where possible. This may cause breaking changes.* Tests. Write them.* Documentation. Write it.History-------2.2.1 (2017-11-15)---------------------* Fixing an issue with the recently released elasticsearch-py 6.0.02.2.0 (2017-07-17)---------------------* Addressing inability to index models with a non-integer PK field (ie. `UUIDField`) - added ability to order bulk queryset on an arbitrary model field.2.1.7 (2017-03-21)---------------------* Allowing direct access (again) to underlying dict/list in `Result` and `Response` classes for serialization and other purposes.2.1.5 (2017-03-20)---------------------* Response class is now MutableSequence based, giving it the properties of a `list`. Its `results` attribute is deprecated, as you can now iterate over the results with the response instance itself.* Result class `results_meta` is deprecated. Use `meta` instead.* `get_from_es_or_None` now returns a `Result` object instead of the raw Elasticsearch result, for consistency.* `get_from_es_or_None` now catches only the Elasticsearch `NotFoundError` exception; previously it caught the more expansive `ElasticsearchException`, which could hide unrelated errors/issues.2.1.4 (2017-03-12)---------------------* Result class is now MutableMapping based, giving it the properties of a `dict`. Its `data` attribute is deprecated.2.1.3 (2017-03-11)---------------------* Minor changes to enable support for elasticsearch-py 5.x.2.1.0 (2017-03-10)---------------------* Addressing a packaging problem which erroneously included pyc/__pycache__ files.2.0.0 (2016-12-20)---------------------* **ALERT: this is a backwards incompatible release**; the old `1.x` (formerly `0.9.x`+) code is maintained on a separate branch for now.* Added support for Django 1.10.* Ported delete/cleanup functionality from `1.x`.* Removed support for Django versions older than 1.8. The goal going forward will be to only support Django versions that the Django core team lists as supported.* Removed elasticsearch-dsl support: responses and results are now represented by simpler internal representations; queries can ONLY be done via a `dict` form.* Removed `ElasticsearchForm` - it is easy enough to build a form to validate search input and then form a query `dict` manually.* Renamed `ElasticsearchIndexMixin` to `ElasticsearchTypeMixin`, seeing as the mixin represented an ES type mapping, not an actual index.* Renamed `ElasticsearchProcessor` to `SimpleSearch`.* Overall, this module has been greatly simplified.1.0.0 (2016-12-20)---------------------* Updated 0.9.x codebase version to 1.0.0.* Reversed decision on the deprecation of the 0.9.x codebase - it will be maintained in this new 1.x branch, although new functionality will mostly occur on newer releases.* Adding cleanup command to remove unaliased indices.* Added ELASTICSEARCH_DELETE_OLD_INDEXES setting to auto-remove after a rebuild.* Thanks to Github user @jimjkelly for the index removal inspiration.0.9.16 (2015-04-24)---------------------* Addressing Django 1.8 warnings.0.9.15 (2015-01-31)---------------------* BUGFIX: Merging pull request from @key that addresses Python 3 support (management command now works).0.9.14 (2015-01-31)---------------------* BUGFIX: Adding in missing `signals.py` file.0.9.13 (2015-01-30)---------------------* Added in new `post_indices_create` and `post_indices_rebuild` signals to allow users to run actions at various points during the index creation and bulk indexing processes.0.9.12 (2014-12-17)---------------------* fixed an issue where per-item request parameters were being added to the bulk data request JSON incorrectly. Tests updated.0.9.11 (2014-12-08)---------------------* added warning if Django's DEBUG=True (causes out of memory errors on constrained  systems due to Django query caching)* added index setting modification on rebuilding indices to remove replicas, lucene  segment merging and disabling the refresh interval - restoring the original  settings afterwards.0.9.10 (2014-12-04)---------------------* added `page` and `page_size` validation in `add_search()`0.9.9 (2014-11-24)---------------------* Renamed search form related classes - more breaking changes. Added in support  for Django's pagination classes (internal hack).0.9.8 (2014-11-23)---------------------* Revamped search form related classes - includes breaking changes.0.9.7 (2014-11-16)---------------------* Python3 supported mentioned in PyPi categorization; new testcases added. Minor  interface change (added `@classmethod`).0.9.6 (2014-11-16)---------------------* Python 3.3+ support, modified (no new) testcases.0.9.5 (2014-11-15)---------------------* Added in tox support, initial set of test cases and verified travis-ci is working.0.9.2 (2014-11-12)---------------------* Fixed broken management command.0.9.1 (2014-11-10)---------------------* Added missing management command module.0.9.0 (2014-11-10)---------------------* In what will become version 1.0, this 0.9.x codebase is a revamp of the  original codebase (v0.5.x). Completely breaking over previous versions.0.5.0 (2014-03-05)---------------------Final release in 0.x codebase - this old codebase is now unmaintained.</longdescription>

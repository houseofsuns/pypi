	<longdescription># libneoradio2![Intrepid Control Systems, Inc.](IntrepidCS_logo.png)# Documentationlibneoradio2 is a library to interface to Intrepid Control Systems, Inc. neoRAD-IO-2 product line. This library is a C library with binding to Python. More language bindings are in the works but unfinished currently.## C Library documentation:https://intrepidcs.github.io/libneoradio2/doc/html/libneoradio2_8h.html# Quick StartThis section is meant as a quickstart guide to building / installing libneoradio2## Python`pip install neoradio2`See [README.md](python/) in the python subdirectory for more details.## Linux### udev setupudev rules are required to be able to access devices as a normal user:Copy [99-intrepidcs.rules](99-intrepidcs.rules) to `/etc/udev/rules.d/` and then run the following command to reload udev:`sudo udevadm control --reload-rules &amp;&amp; sudo udevadm trigger`You may need to unplug and replug in the device in order for udev rules to fully take place.### Dependencies:Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install cmake build-essential libudev-dev`Fedora: `sudo dnf install cmake gcc-c++ libudev-devel`### Build from source```$ git submodule update --init --recursive$ mkdir build$ cd build$ cmake ..$ make$ sudo make install```## WindowsVisual studio 2015 or greater is required to build. cmake can also be used to build but is untested currently. -Build needs to be set to 32-bit. -hidapi/windows/hidapi.sln project needs to be opened and converted at least once in order to load correctly.# ExamplesExamples can be found under the example directory [here](example/) # neoRAD-IO2 Product LineThe neoRAD-IO2 series is a family of ruggedized products that provide an isolated analog, digital or temperature interface to a PC via the PCâ€™s USB port. These tools can also be paired with Intrepid products that include a USB port such as neoVI ION, neoVI FIRE 2, RAD-Galaxy, and RAD-Gigalog. In addition, the neoRAD-IO2-CANHUB can power and convert the native UART signal to CAN or CAN FD for use in any CAN device.The neoRAD-IO2 family communicates on an open source UART based serial communication protocol. Up to eight devices can be daisy chained. The chain length is limited by current supplied to the chain through USB. All neoRAD-IO2 devices have input to output isolation, and 2.5kV isolation between each of the eight banks. Bank to bank isolation is important because it allows the common mode voltage of each input signal to be different than the other channels in other banks. (This is a major source of measurement error and can damage to the product.) Additionally, noise on one channel will not affect other channels.

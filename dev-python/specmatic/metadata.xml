	<longdescription># Specmatic PythonThis is a Python library to run [Specmatic](https://specmatic.in).Specmatic is a contract driven development tool that allows us to turn OpenAPI contracts into executable specifications.&lt;br/&gt;Click below to learn more about Specmatic and Contract Driven Development&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[![Specmatic - Contract Driven Development](https://img.youtube.com/vi/3HPgpvd8MGg/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HPgpvd8MGg &quot;Specmatic - Contract Driven Development&quot;)  The specmatic python library provides three main functions:  - The ability to start and stop a python web app like flask/sanic.  - The ability to run specmatic in test mode against an open api contract/spec.  - The ability to stub out an api dependency using the specmatic stub feature.#### Running Contract TestsA contract test validates an open api specification against a running api service.  The open api specification can be present either locally or in a [Central Contract Repository](https://specmatic.in/documentation/central_contract_repository.html)  [Click here](https://specmatic.in/documentation/contract_tests.html) to learn more about contract tests.  #### How to use- Create a file called test_contract.py in your test folder.  - Declare an empty class in it called 'TestContract'.    This is could either be a normal class like:  ``````  class TestContract:    pass  ``````  Or you could also have a class which inherits from unittest.TestCase:  ``````  class TestContract(unittest.TestCase):    pass  ``````  Specmatic will use this class to inject tests dynamically into it when you run it via PyTest or UnitTest.## WSGI Apps#### To run contract tests with a stub for a wsgi app (like Flask):  ``````class TestContract:    pass        Specmatic() \    .with_project_root(PROJECT_ROOT) \    .with_stub(stub_host, stub_port, [expectation_json_file]) \    .with_wsgi_app(app, app_host, app_port) \    .test(TestContract) \    .run()`````` - In this, we are passing:  - an instance of your asgi app like flask   - app_host and app_port. If they are not specified, the app will be started on a random available port on 127.0.0.1.  - You would need a [specmatic.json](https://specmatic.in/documentation/specmatic_json.html) file to be present in the root directory of your project.  - an empty test class.  - stub_host, stub_port, optional list of json files to set expectations on the stub.      The stub_host, stub_port will be used to run the specmatic stub server.       If they are not supplied, the stub will be started on a random available port on 127.0.0.1.        [Click here](https://specmatic.in/documentation/service_virtualization_tutorial.html) to learn more about stubbing/service virtualization.-  You can run this test from either your IDE or command line by pointing pytest to your test folder:   ``````pytest test -v -s``````  - NOTE: Please ensure that you set the '-v' and '-s' flags while running pytest as otherwise pytest may swallow up the console output.  #### To run contract tests without a stub:``````class TestContract:    pass    Specmatic() \    .with_project_root(PROJECT_ROOT) \    .with_wsgi_app(app, app_host, app_port) \    .test(TestContract) \    .run()``````                        ## ASGI Apps#### To run contract tests with a stub for an asgi app (like sanic):- If you are using an asgi app like sanic, fastapi, use the ``````with_asgi_app`````` function and pass it a string in the 'module:app' format.``````class TestContract:    pass        Specmatic() \    .with_project_root(PROJECT_ROOT) \    .with_stub(stub_host, stub_port, [expectation_json_file]) \    .with_asgi_app('main:app', app_host, app_port) \    .test(TestContract) \    .run()``````### Passing extra agruments to stub/test- To pass arguments like '--strict', '--testBaseUrl', pass them as a list to the 'args' parameter:``````class TestContract:    passSpecmatic() \    .with_project_root(PROJECT_ROOT) \    .with_stub(stub_host, stub_port, [expectation_json_file], ['--strict']) \    .with_wsgi_app(app, port=app_port) \    .test(TestContract, args=['--testBaseURL=http://localhost:5000']) \    .run()``````## Common Issues- **'Error loading ASGI app'**    This error occurs when an incorrect app module string is passed to the ``````with_asgi_app`````` function.      #### Solutions:   - Try to identify the correct module in which your app variable is instantiated/imported.       For example if your 'app' variable is declared in main.py, try passing 'main:app'.     - Try running the app using uvicorn directly:       `````` uvciron 'main:app' ``````       If you are able to get the app started using uvicorn, it will work with specmatic too.  ## Sample Projects- [Check out the Specmatic Order BFF Python repo](https://github.com/znsio/specmatic-order-bff-python/) to see more examples of how to use specmatic with a Flask app.  - [Check out the Specmatic Order BFF Python Sanic repo](https://github.com/znsio/specmatic-order-bff-python-sanic/) to see more examples of how to use specmatic with a Sanic app.  - [Check out the Specmatic Order API Python repo](https://github.com/znsio/specmatic-order-api-python/) to see an examples of how to just run tests without using a stub.    </longdescription>

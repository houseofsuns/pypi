	<longdescription># pydvmaA Python package for dynamics and vibration measurements and analysis.## About pydvmaThis is a modular library for data-measurement and analysis in the context of dynamics and vibration, for use in student laboratory experiments as well as for research projects, developed at Cambridge University Engineering Department.A high-level interface allows straightforward application for common use-cases and a low-level interface provides more control when needed.The aim is for a library that is simple to use and simple to maintain. It is not a full-featured GUI, but when used in conjunction with Jupyter Notebooks it is intended to provide the best of both worlds: interactive tools for common tasks and command line interface for customisation.## Getting started### InstallationThe logger requires Python 3.7 or above to work with soundcard acquisition.On Windows:```conda install pyaudiopip install pydvma```Or clone this repository and install using:```python setup.py install```On Mac OS X: install PortAudio. If you use Homebrew, just run this:```shell$ brew install portaudio```On Linux: TBCAlternatively you can use the environment yml file provided:```conda env create -f logger_env.ymlactivate logger```### Running the loggerTo get started, open the file:```pydvma_template.ipynb```or within a Jupyter Notebook or Python console:```python%gui qtimport pydvma as dvmasettings = dvma.MySettings()osc = dvma.Oscilloscope(settings)logger = dvma.Logger(settings)```## RoadmapAt present the library has basic functionality for:- logging data using soundcards or National Instrument DAQs (requires NiDAQmx to be installed from NI, windows only)- logging with pre-trigger for impulse response measurements- logging with pc generated output (soundcard and NIDAQ)- computing frequency domain data- computing transfer function data- computing sonograms/spectrograms- basic modal analysis tools (mode-fitting)- saving and plotting data- export to Matlab- interactive tools for standard acquisition and analysis- oscilloscope view of input signalsThe plan is to include the following functionality:- wider support for import/export- more advanced modal analysis tools (e.g. global fitting)- extend the range of hardware that can be accessed from this library## Contributer guidelinesContributions to this project are welcomed, keeping in mind the project aims above:- If you find a bug, please report using GitHub's issue tracker- For bug-fixes and refinements: please feel free to clone the repository, make edits and create a pull request with a clear description of changes made.- If you would like to make a more significant contribution or change, then please be in contact to outline your suggestion.Please see the documentation for details of the code structure and templates for anticipated applications.</longdescription>

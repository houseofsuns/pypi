	<longdescription>Nephele: a shell for aws.```````````````````````````Overview========I wasn't happy with the AWS web console, because the UI feltdisjointed and was slow to navigate. So I slapped this together:a very simple interactive cli shell in python.I'm actively using it for work, so it supports the things thatI'm doing, rather than being an exhaustive system. I invitepull requests for missing features, bugfixes, etc.WARNINGS========This tool is incredibly immature. It WILL be changing considerably aslong as I'm using it, because I will be viewing the things it does (ordoesn't do), and the manner in which it does (or doesn't do) them asimpediments to my workflow.It is not even &quot;alpha&quot; level code yet, so expect things to be brokenor buggy. Also expect syntax to be in a fairly constant state of flux.Installation============.. code-block::    pip install nepheleUsage=====.. code-block:: bash    $ nephele    (aws)/: helpConfiguration=============Nephele reads `~/.nephele/config.yaml` during startup. Its format looks like this:.. code-block::   profile: {profile-name}   profiles:     {profile-name}:       awsProfile: {aws profile name}       ssh-jump-host: {jump host name or ip}       ssh-jump-user: {jump host username}     {profile-name-2}:       awsProfile: {aws profile name}       ssh-jump-host: {jump host name or ip}       ssh-jump-user: {jump host username}   ssh-macros:     {macro-name}: {remote command}SSH support===========If you've set up your `~/.nephele/config.yaml` with a correct`profiles.{profile}.ssh-jump-host` entry, then this is probably the bestpart of `nephele`.nephele can ssh to an instance without you having to figure out itsip, modify /etc/host, or know anything other than its aws instance id:.. code:: bash  (aws)/: ssh {instance-id}  /usr/bin/ssh {first private ip}  Last login: {sometime} from {somewhere}         __|  __|_  )         _|  (     /   Amazon Linux AMI        ___|\___|___|  https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/2016.09-release-notes/If you've navigated to an autoscaling group, you don't even need toknow the instance id. You can ssh by the instance's index in theautoscaling group's list of instances:.. code-block:: bash    (aws)/stack:{stack}/stack:{substack}/: asg 0    loading auto scaling group 0    loading stack resource arn:{arn}    AutoScaling Group:{name}    === Instances ===     0 Healthy az-2a {instance-id}     1 Healthy az-2b {instance-id}     2 Healthy az-2c {instance-id}    (aws)/stack:{stack}/stack:{substack}/asg:{asg}/: ssh 2    /usr/bin/ssh {first private ip}    Last login: {sometime} from {somewhere}         __|  __|_  )         _|  (     /   Amazon Linux AMI        ___|\___|___|    https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/2016.09-release-notes/It also supports port forwarding!.. code-block:: bash    (aws)/stack:{stack}/stack:{substack}/asg:{asg}/: ssh 2 -L 8888:localhost:8888    /usr/bin/ssh {first private ip}      Last login: {sometime} from {somewhere}         __|  __|_  )         _|  (     /   Amazon Linux AMI        ___|\___|___|    https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/2016.09-release-notes/    $ exit    (aws)/stack:{stack}/stack:{substack}/asg:{asg}/: ssh 2 -L 8888 # &lt;-- useful shorthand!So how do you set up your `~/.nephele/config.yaml` for this? It helps if yourAWS admins have set things up so that using ssh from a command line isfairly straightforward. If you need a `-J` option to ssh to connect toa host, specify the jump host user and password using`profiles.{profile}.ssh-jump-host` and`profiles.{profile}.ssh-jump-user`, respectively.SSH also supports selecting an ssh key based upon instance tags (orother instance metadata). To use this, implement an ssh plug-in, andplace it in `~/.nephele/plugins` to accomplish this. Here's anexample:.. code-block:: python    import os    class sshPlugin:      def getUserName(self, instance, profile):        &quot;&quot;&quot;        Given a description of an AWS instance and a nephele profile,        determine the user name to use when ssh-ing to that instance.        &quot;&quot;&quot;        return &quot;ec2-user&quot;      def getIdentityFile(self, instance, profile):        &quot;&quot;&quot;        Given a description of an AWS instance and a nephele profile,        determine the name of the ssh identity file to use when ssh-ing to        that instance.        &quot;&quot;&quot;        return os.path.join(os.path.expanduser(&quot;~&quot;),&quot;.ssh&quot;,&quot;keys&quot;,&quot;prod&quot;,'somekey.pem')Command Reference=================We use the excellent argparse module to specify how commands areused. This reference contains descriptions only; for details onsyntax, use any command's `-h` option.Globally Available Commands---------------------------config^^^^^^Deal with configuration. Available subcommands:* config print - print the current configuration* config reload - reload the current configuration from disk* config set - change a setting in the configuration* config save - save the configuration to diskmfa^^^Enter a 6-digit MFA token. Nephele will execute theappropriate `aws` command line to authenticate that token.instance^^^^^^^^Navigate to an instance. This is different from `ssh` in that it isn't_connecting_ to the instance; just navigating the shell there fordetailed inspection.profile^^^^^^^Select nephele profilequit^^^^Exit nephelessh^^^SSH to an instance. Note: This command is extended in more specific contexts, for exampleinside Autoscaling Groups.slash^^^^^Navigate back to the root level.For example, if you are in `(aws)/stack:.../asg:.../`, executing`slash` will place you in `(aws)/`.up^^^Navigate up by one level.For example, if you are in `(aws)/stack:.../asg:.../`, executing `up`will place you in `(aws)/stack:.../`.New Features============_Most Recent Last._Doesn't include bug fixes, or any features I forgot to list. Maybethat last bit was obvious :-DYes, you could figure this all out by looking at commit logs. Why wouldI make you go through that?* You can now input an MFA token by running `mfa {token}`. It's  rudimentary support at this point, and likely broken if you've never  used [aws-mfa](https://github.com/lonelyplanet/aws-mfa) before.* You can now ssh with shorthanded port forwarding. Basically, if you  want to forward a port on the remote server via the same local port,  you no longer have to use the `-L {port}:localhost:{port}`  syntax. Instead, just say `-L {port}`. You can still use the server  as a tunnel to yet another server, or choose different local/remote  port numbers with the old syntax though.* When launching, nephele automatically runs &quot;stacks&quot; for you.* --profile (short: -p) selects a specific AWS profile. This is  helpful when other processes require that your default profile be  one other than the one you would like nephele to use.* nephele now knows how to get your aws device info. I also tried to  make it file-compatible with aws-mfa, so you should in theory not  need the separate aws-mfa tool any longer - just use nephele to  manage your .aws/{mfa-related-files}, and you should be good to  go. Of course, my wife always says she wants to move to Theory,  because everything works... in Theory.* --mfa (short: -m) provide your mfa command at launch. If you *know*  your cached mfa credentials are expired, this saves the step of  waiting for nephele to get access denied.* there is now a `profile` command to change profiles after you've  started nephele.* `stacks` now adds `-e` and `-i` parameters so you can exclude or  include new stack states in the filter.* `~/.nephele/config.yaml` is the new config file. It has one setting for now,  `profile`. Example:.. code-block:: config    ---    profile: {aws profile name}* `ssh` commands now have a `-R`/`--replace-key` option. It is quite  possible in AWS for IP addresses to get recycled, especially if you  are creating/tearing-down cloudformation stacks while iterating on  their templates. When this happens, you don't want to have to go  hack on `~/.ssh/known_hosts` in order to ssh in to the host. This  option will run the appropriate command (`ssh-keygen -R {host}`) to  remove the entry before running ssh.* auto-scaling groups now support the `terminateInstance` command.* AwsStack now prints stack events and outputs as if they were normal  stack resources.* Added ability to glob when listing stacks. E.g., `stacks *cass*`  will list all stacks with &quot;cass&quot; as a substring.* Renamed from aws-shell to nephele (after the mythological cloud  nymph), and got the tool to be installable via pip.* You can now run a command across the instances in an auto scaling  group. Navigate to the group and use the `run` command.* Cloudwatch logging support has commenced. It's very rudimentary  so far - you can see log groups inside stacks, select them  using the `logGroup` command, and see that there are streams present.  The output is not beautified yet, and you can't actually see  the content of those streams yet. Soon.* IAM role support has commenced, too. It's also very rudimentary so  far. You can see roles inside cloudformation stacks, down to the  policy document level using the `role`. The output is not beautified yet  and it's purely read-only. I don't anticipate beautifying it, because  pprint() is good enough for me, but I certainly welcome patches if  it matters to you.* Cloudwatch logging support continues with the addition of the  `logStream` command, which is available from inside a `logGroup`.  Right now you can tail the logs, and they aren't beautified.  As I get more comfortable with the log-scanning API, I plan to add  some cross-stream log viewing at the `logGroup` level, probably  in the form of a grep-like capability. No promises, of course,  just logging where my head's at.* In an autoscaling group, the `printInstances` command has two new  options: `-t` to print the list of tags, and `-d` to print all the  node's details.* In a stack, the `copy` command now knows how to copy an asg's id  to the clipboard.* ASG's now support the `printActivities` and `printActivity` commands  to assist in debugging changes initiated by autoscaling.* ASG's now support showing scaling policies via the `printPolicy`  command.* ASG `run` command supports `-s` option to skip _n_ hosts* Stacks now display their parameters. These are escaped and &quot;elipsified&quot;  in order to fit. Will be adding a command to print a full parameter  value at some point.* stdplus.elipsifyMiddle is now a thing.* ssh commands no longer depend on `~/.ssh/config` working, instead  supporting `~/.nephele/config.yaml`* ssh now supports the fantastic -J option (you'll need a recent ssh  client for this to work)* ssh has a very limited macro capability. While it does not yet have  a way to do variable substitution, you can do something like this:.. code-block:: config    ssh-macros:      cassandrapid: pgrep -f CassandraDaemon    (aws)/stack:.../asg:.../: ssh -m 0 cassandrapid    /usr/bin/ssh 192.168.1.1 -q -J jump-host.us-west-2.generic.domain pgrep -f CassandraDaemon    3285    (aws)/stack:.../asg:.../:* You can now reload your config using the `config reload` command.* Started adding a command reference to this doc.* There is now a mechanism for determining which user and identity  files to use when ssh-ing, based on instance metadata. </longdescription>

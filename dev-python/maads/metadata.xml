Users can easily integrate Predictive Analytics and Prescriptive Analytics in any solution by wrapping additional code around the functions below.  To install this library a request should be made to **support@otics.ca** for a username and a MAADSTOKEN.  Once you have these credentials then install this Python library.**Compatibility**    - Python 3.8 or greater    - Minimal Python skills needed**Copyright**   - Author: Sebastian Maurice, PhD**Installation**   - At the command prompt write:     **pip install maads**     - This assumes you have [Downloaded Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and installed it on your computer.  **Syntax**  - There are literally two lines of code you need to write to train your data and make predictions:**Main functions:**   - **dotraining**     Executes hundreds of agents, running hundreds of advanced algorithms and completes in minutes.  A master agent then chooses the BEST algorithm that best  models your data.   - **dopredictions**     After training, make high quality predictions - takes 1-2 seconds.   - **hyperpredictions**     After training, make high quality predictions - takes less than half a second (about ~100 milliseconds). Users can also generate predictions using **non-python code** such as JAVA.  Using the **maadshyperpredictions.CLASS** file, java apps can call the MAADS prediction server to return predictions very fast.  Other apps, using **any** other language, can also call the MAADS prediction server using standard TCP/IP client/server communication protocols like REST:  This gives MAADS users' the maximum flexibility to integrate MAADS predictions in any solution!    You can also use hyperpredictions as an API (Python not needed) and make calls from any application using the following format: GET http://[maads server website]:[port]/[microserviceid]/?hyperpredict=[optimal algo key],[[input data]],[MAADSTOKEN]  MAADS hyper-prediction can also be used in a MICROSERVICES architecture that utilize API gateways (reverse proxies).  This allows organizations to balance loads on the server and manage millions or billions of connections, to hyper-predictions, per day without experiencing latency issues. **Support functions:**- **dolistkeys**        - List all of the keys associated with the data you have analysed. - **dolistkeyswithkey**        - List data associated with a single key.- **dodeletewithkey**        - Permanently delete all data associated with your key.- **returndata**        - Returns data from the string buffer.- **getpicklezip**        - Automatically downloads a ZIP file containing the optimal algorithms.  Users can modify the parameter estimates as they wish.- **sendpicklezip**        - Automatically upload a ZIP file containing the optimal algorithms to MAADS. The optimal algorithms will immediately take effect for predictions.- **deploytoprod**        - Automatically deploy the optimal algorithms to another MAADS server (i.e. production); MAADS will read the ZIP file, extract the algorithms and make all database updates.  This function is useful when your MAADS training server(s) and MAADS prediction server(s) are separate.  A powerful way to integrate MAADS in a distributed architecture is to automatically train your data, then deploy the optimal algorithms to some other server for predictions.  This is a great way to scale your analytics in a large (global) entreprise setting, seamlessly and fast, with MAADS!- **algoinfo**        - Get detailed information on the algorithm and other information.- **genpdf**        - Retrieve the PDF containing all of the detailed information on the algorithm and other information like model explanation and feature selection, etc.- **featureselectionjson**        - Returns JSON collection of feature selection results for easier programmatic manipulation. Use dotraining feature selection switch to return a CSV file of   feature selections.  This function conducts **unsupervised learning** and important part of model building.**Optimization:**- **optimize**   - Automatically perform optimization of the optimal algorithms by minimizing or maximixing them to find optimal values for the independent variables:       - MAADS offers a unique and powerful way to find the optimal values of the independent variables       - Users can even minimize or maximize upto THREE optimal algorithms AT THE SAME TIME by building a multi-objective equation with the optimal algorithms   - By finding the optimal values of the independent variables you can &quot;prescribe&quot; the right combination of independent variables' values that will lead to the HIGHEST or LOWEST value for the optimal algorithms   - MAADS is one of the first technologies to offer a seamless integration between PREDICTIVE and PRESCRIPTIVE analytics.**Natural Language Processing (NLP):**- **nlp**   - Automatically perform NLP to summarize large amounts of text data.  Specifically, there are three data sources one can use:       - **Website URL:** you can pass a URL to the NLP function and it will automatically scrape the site and return a summary of the text.       - **PDF:** Send a PDF to be summarized.       - **Text:** Paste text to be summarized.       - This allows users to integrate NLP in unique and powerful ways with advanced analytics. - **nlpclassify**   - Automatically apply machine learning to predict outcomes from text data.  Specifically, MAADS will:       - Preprocess text data and convert it to numeric vectors using over 50 Billion words to vector mappings plus custom mappings specific to your trained model   - Clean your text data by removing strange characters, punctuations, common words, lemmatize the words, etc..   - Convert the dependent category variable to labels.     - If dependent variable is not categorical, you can tell MAADS not to convert the dependent variable.  This means you can regress TEXT data on NUMERIC data!       - This function allows users to integrate NLP in unique and powerful ways with advanced analytics to text based systems like Help Desk or security platforms.**Data Prepping:**- **balancebigdata**  - This is a very convenient function to extract a data subset from a very large dataset while maintaining its structure.  MAADS will do a very detailed analysis of the data to     determine the distribution of the data by binning each variable in a histogram to determine which variables have a good distribution and which ones do not. Using a special algorithm it can effectively extract a subset of data from a **very large data set** which will make it easier for users to use this dataset for MAADS training.  This function can also be very effective in reducing MAADS compute times when training.**First import the Python library.****import maads**1. **maads.dotraining(MAADSTOKEN,CSV_local_file, feature_analysis, remove_outliers, has_seasonality, dependent_variable, maadsurl,throttle,theserverlocalname,summer,winter,shoulder,trainingpercentage,retrainingdays,retraindeploy,shuffle)****Parameters:***MAADSTOKEN* : string, required- A token given to you by MAADS administrator.*CSV_local_file* : string, required- A local comma-separated-file (csv) with Date in the first column.

For example, if you want to minimize TWO optimal algorithms and you want an objective function= algo1 + algo2, then objeq=1,1.  If objective function=-algo1 - algo2 then objeq=-1,-1.  If objective function=-algo1 + algo2 + algo3 then objeq=-1,1,1, etc.  etc.  *boundslimits* : string, default='none'- Sets custom limits on the bounds of independent variable.  The lower and upper limit bounds can be for each variable or a subset of variable. The format must be the following: *variablename:[-1,0,1]:[lowervalue,equal,none]:[uppervalue,none]:[i,f]*  - variablename is the name of your independent variable  - [-1,0,1] must be ONE of -1,0,1.  -1 means values of variable name must be all negative, 0 means values can be negative or positive, 1 means values must be all positive  - lowervalue is the lower bound on variable name or equal or none.  If 'equal' you must specify the value in the 'uppervalue' field.  - uppervalue is the upper bound on variable name or none for no bound.  If no bound, MAADS will create a large value using the High value of variable.  - [i,f] means i=integer, f=float, this allows users to specify the types of values for variables.  For example:  If you have two variables named HOUR and MINUTE and you want to bound them, then you can specify:  - *&quot;hour:1:0:23,minute:1:0:59&quot;* means hour is all positive, bounded between 0 and 23, AND minute is all positive bounded between 0 and 59.  You can also just specify   - *&quot;hour:1:none:none,minute:1:none:none&quot;* means hour is all positive and minute is all positive. Or,    - *&quot;hour:1:none:23,minute:1:0:none&quot; means hour is all positive with no lower limit, and upper limit of 23, minute is all positive with lower limit of 0 and no upper limit.   - *&quot;hour:1:equal:12,minute:1:0:59&quot;* means hour will equal 12 (hour=12), AND minute is all positive bounded between 0 and 59.  You can also just specify  - *Boundslimits* will give users maximum amount of flexibity when specifying bounds for constraints.   *NOTE:* Variablename MUST match the variables that the model is trained on.  You can retrieve these EXACT names from the function: *maads.dolistkeyswithkey(MAADSTOKEN, pkey,maadsurl)* *a1cons* : int, optional, default=1, can be 1,2,3,4- a1cons specifies the bounds on the independent variables in the constraint equations for algo 1.  For example:  - if a1cons=1, then MAADS will &quot;USE MIN/MAX Of Variables For Bounds&quot;.  Specifically, min &lt;= var &lt;= max  - if a1cons=2, then MAADS will &quot;USE MEAN +/- STD Of Variables For Bounds&quot;. Specifically, mean-std &lt;= var &lt;= mean+std  - if a1cons=3, then MAADS will &quot;USE MIN/MAX +/- STD Of Variables For Bounds&quot;. Specifically, min-std &lt;= var &lt;= max+std  - if a1cons=4, then MAADS will &quot;USE MEDIAN +/- STD Of Variables For Bounds&quot;. Specifically, median-std &lt;= var &lt;= median+std*a2cons* : int, optional, default=1, can be 1,2,3,4.  Only used if algo2 is specified.- a2cons  specifies the bounds on the independent variables in the constraint equations for algo 2.  For example:  - if a2cons=1, then MAADS will &quot;USE MIN/MAX Of Variables For Bounds&quot;.  Specifically, min &lt;= var &lt;= max    - if a2cons=2, then MAADS will &quot;USE MEAN +/- STD Of Variables For Bounds&quot;. Specifically, mean-std &lt;= var &lt;= mean+std  - if a2cons=3, then MAADS will &quot;USE MIN/MAX +/- STD Of Variables For Bounds&quot;. Specifically, min-std &lt;= var &lt;= max+std  - if a2cons=4, then MAADS will &quot;USE MEDIAN +/- STD Of Variables For Bounds&quot;. Specifically, median-std &lt;= var &lt;= median+std*a3cons* : int, optional, default=1, can be 1,2,3,4.  Only used if algo3 is specified.- a3cons  specifies the bounds on the independent variables in the constraint equations for algo 3.  For example:  - if a3cons=1, then MAADS will &quot;USE MIN/MAX Of Variables For Bounds&quot;.  Specifically, min &lt;= var &lt;= max  - if a3cons=2, then MAADS will &quot;USE MEAN +/- STD Of Variables For Bounds&quot;. Specifically, mean-std &lt;= var &lt;= mean+std   - if a3cons=3, then MAADS will &quot;USE MIN/MAX +/- STD Of Variables For Bounds&quot;. Specifically, min-std &lt;= var &lt;= max+std  - if a3cons=4, then MAADS will &quot;USE MEDIAN +/- STD Of Variables For Bounds&quot;. Specifically, median-std &lt;= var &lt;= median+std*forceupdate* : int, optional, default=0, can be 1, or 0- forceupdate tells MAADS to update the optimal values.  If forceupdate=0, MAADS will decide if the NEW optimal values should replace the OLD optimal values.  Specifically, if you are maximizing an optimal algo and the new value is LOWER than old value, MAADS will NOT replace old value with new value, because the old value is better.  If forceupdate=1, MAADS will force an update regardless if the new value is better or worse than old value.*iters* : int, optional, default=100, max=500- Specifies the number of iterations to use in the optimization algorithms.*step* : int, optional, default=3, can be 1,2,3,4- Specifies how to generate the values of the independent variables for the constraint equations.  For example,  - if step=1, then MAADS will use a uniform distribution bounded by the choices of a1cons, a2cons, a3cons, as applicable.  - if step=2, then MAADS will use a Gaussian distribution bounded by the choices of a1cons, a2cons, a3cons, as applicable.  - if step=3, then MAADS will combine uniform and Gaussian by averaging to create a distribution bounded by the choices of a1cons, a2cons, a3cons, as applicable.  - if step=4, then MAADS will find values around an epsilon distance, using the standard deviation, around the values that have historically led to lowest or highest values depending on your optimization problem.*perc* : string, optional, default='min_0_max_0' - 0 means 0%, values should be greater and equal to 0.- Specifies by how much to &quot;stretch&quot; the bounds on the constraints.  For example, if &quot;min_50_max_150&quot;, means to lower the MIN bound by 50%, and increase the MAX bound by 150%.  This allows users to specify any size of bounds. **Returns:** JSON formatted information.        - The information contains all of the key details associated with optimization including, value of the objective function, constraints, bounds, initial conditions, optimal values of independent variables, etc..   **17.  maads.balancebigdata(localcsvfile,numberofbins,maxrows,outputfile,bincutoff,distcutoff,startcolumn=0)****Parameters:***localcsvfile* : string, required- Local file, must be CSV formatted.*numberofbins* : int, required- The number of bins for the histogram. You can set to any value but 10 is usually fine.*maxrows* :  int, required- The number of rows to return, which will be a subset of your original data.*outputfile* : string, required- Your new data will be writted as CSV to this file.*bincutoff* : float, required. -  This is the threshold percentage for the bins. Specifically, the data in each variable is allocated to bins, but many    times it will not fall in ALL of the bins.  By setting this percentage between 0 and 1, MAADS will choose variables that   exceed this threshold to determine which variables have data that are well distributed across bins.  The variables   with the most distributed values in the bins will drive the selection of the rows in your dataset that give the best   distribution - this will be very important for MAADS training.  Usually 0.7 is good.*distcutoff* : float, required. -  This is the threshold percentage for the distribution. Specifically, MAADS uses a Lilliefors statistic to determine whether    the data are well distributed.  The lower the number the better.  Usually 0.45 is good.   *startcolumn* : int, optional- This tells MAADS which column to start from.  If you have DATE in the first column, you can tell MAADS to start from 1 (columns are zero-based)RETURNS: Returns a detailed JSON object and new balaced dataset written to outputfile.**Simple Example**      #############################################################Author: Sebastian Maurice, PhDCopyright by Sebastian Maurice 2018All rights reserved.Email: Sebastian.maurice@otics.ca#############################################################** IMPORT THE MAAADS LIBRARY* import maads** IMPORT ADDITIONAL LIBRARY** import imp** LOAD ANY DATABASE LIBRARY TO STORE PREDICTIONS** sqlconn = imp.load_source('sqlconn','C:\\sqlsrvconnpython.py')** OPEN DATABASE CONNECTION** connection = sqlconn.doconnect() cur = connection.cursor()** TEST DATA    **    inputs = '1/12/2018,37.76896'  pkey='demouser_test2log_csv' MAADSTOKEN=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX username='demouser' url='/maads/remotemasstreamremote.php'** DO TRAINING - SERVER RETURNS A KEY THAT POINTS TO THE BEST ALGORITHM** thedata=maads.dotraining(MAADSTOKEN,'C:\\test2log.csv',1,0,0,'depvar',url)** PARSE RETURNED DATA** pkey=maads.returndata(thedata,'PKEY:') algo=maads.returndata(thedata,'ALGO0:') accuracy=maads.returndata(thedata,'ACCURACY0:')      ** DO PREDICTIONS WITH THE RETURNED KEY** thepredictions=maads.dopredictions(MAADSTOKEN,0,pkey,inputs,url)** PARSE THE DATA** prediction=maads.returndata(thepredictions,'DATA:')** INSERT PREDICTIONS TO ANY DATABASE TABLE** forecastdate=inputs.split(',')[0] predictionvalue=prediction[2] accuracy=prediction[3] SQL=&quot;INSERT INTO PREDICTIONS VALUES('%s','%s','%s','%s','%s',%.3f,%.3f)&quot; % (forecastdate,username,pkey,company,inputs,predictionvalue,accuracy) cur.execute(SQL) cur.commit()** CLOSE THE DATABASE CONNECTION** cur.close()        </longdescription>

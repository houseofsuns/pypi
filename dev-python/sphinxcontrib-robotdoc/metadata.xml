	<longdescription>Introduction------------This package provides a Sphinx-extension to embed Robot Framework test suites,test cases, or user keywords in into Sphinx-documents in spirit of the autodocSphinx-extension.When to use?------------Consider not using this package.This package was created before Robot Framework plain text syntax lexer(highlighting support) was implemented and included into Pygments (&gt;= 1.6rc1).This package was also created before Robot Framework's built-in libdoc-tool gotReST-syntax support for embedded documentation syntax (&gt;=1.7.5) and RobotFramework got new ReST-support (&gt;= 1.8.2).Nowadays, the easies way to embed Robot Framework code (plain text syntax) intoSphinx-document should be to simply use the standard ``.. code-block::robotframework`` or include libdoc-generated html with ``:download:``-syntax.Yet, there may be some edge cases where this is the most convenient way toembed external Robot examples into your documentation.Usage-----Add ``sphinxcontrib_robotdoc`` into the extensions list of your Sphinxconfiguration (``conf.py``)::    extensions = [        &quot;sphinxcontrib_robotdoc&quot;,    ]Embed test cases and user keywords into your documentation with thefollowing custom Docutils-directives::    .. robot-tests:: Test case title or RegExp.*       :source: my_package:tests/acceptance/my_suite.robot       :tags: bugs, new    .. robot-keywords:: Keyword title or RegExp.*       :source: my_package:tests/acceptance/my_suite.txtBoth directives (``robot-tests`` and ``robot-keywords``) take a regularexpression as their main option (or *content* in Docutils' terms) to filter theembeded test cases or keywords found from the given ``source``-resource (orrelative path). If no regular expression is given, all found tests or keywordswill be embedded (like having ``.*`` as the default).Path given to the mandatory ``source``-option must be either be a packageresources (using syntax *package_name:resource/path/in/package*) or a relativepath from the current document.The test case directive (``robot-tests``) accepts also an option ``tags``,which is optional. It should inclue a comma separated list of the tags to beused when filtering the tests to be embedded.Both directives take an optional ``style``-option. When ``style`` is setto ``expanded`` the output will include headings such as the table name andtest case or keyword name. When ``style`` is set to ``minimal`` the outputwill include only the target documentation strings without any robot syntax.Please, note that he documentation found from the embedded test is parsedusing Docutils, as a part of the target document. This differs from `RobotFramework`_'s own documentation tools, which expect its own custom markup... _Robot Framework: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/robotframeworkOther directives----------------``robot-source`` will embed a complete test suite or resource file withsyntax highlighting::    .. robot-source::       :source: my_package:tests/acceptance/my_suite.txt``robot-settings`` will embed a syntax highlighted settings table (withdocumentation parsed as reStructuredText) for a test suite a resource file::    .. robot-settings::       :source: my_package:tests/acceptance/my_suite.txt``robot-variables`` will embed a syntax highlighted variables table (withdocumentation parsed as reStructuredText) for a test suite a resource file::    .. robot-variables::       :source: my_package:tests/acceptance/my_suite.txtAlso directives ``robot-settings`` and ``robot-variables`` take an optional``style``-option. When ``style`` is set to ``expanded`` the output willinclude the table name.LaTeX output------------LaTeX output is based on Pygments LatexFormatter, which requires customstyle definitions to be injeced into latex document preamble. That's done bydefault, but when Sphinx ``latex_preamble`` setting is set manually, itshould include the following::   from pygments.formatters import LatexFormatter   latex_elements['latex_preamble'] = '''\   \usepackage{fancyvrb}   \usepackage{color}   ''' + LatexFormatter().get_style_defs()Changelog=========0.11.0 (2019-11-08)-------------------- Fix bad escape  [Jasper Craeghs]0.10.0 (2018-05-11)-------------------- Add to release as universal wheel  [Asko Soukka]- Changes for newer sphinx versions  [Stein Heselmans]0.9.1 (2017-05-31)------------------- Allow for tabs in documentation of robot files  [Stein Heselmans]0.9.0 (2017-05-21)------------------- Python 3 support  [Stein Heselmans]0.8.0 (2015-10-09)------------------- Change to separate tags with double space instead comma  [Asko Soukka]0.7.3 (2014-06-13)------------------- Added documentation generating for test-cases, keywords tags in expanded style.

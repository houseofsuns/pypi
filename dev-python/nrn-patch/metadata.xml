I've only patched holes I frequently encounter myself when using the`h.Section`, `h.NetStim` and `h.NetCon` functions. Feel free to open an issue or fork thisproject and open a pull request for missing or broken parts of the interface.# PhilosophyPython interfaces should be Pythonic, this wrapper offers just that:  - Full Python objects: each wonky C-like NEURON object is wrapped in a    full fledged Python object, easily handled and extended through    inheritance.  - Duck typed interface: take a look at the magic methods I use and any    object you create with those methods present will work just fine    with Patch.  - Correct garbage collection, objects connected to eachother don't    dissapear: Objects that rely on eachother store a reference to    eachother. As is the basis for any sane object oriented interface.  - Explicit exceptions: I catch silent failures and gotchas and raise    semantic errors with a class hierarchy instead for granular    exception handling.**Warning:** When running MPI simulations errors cannot be caught due to a[bug](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/issues/1112) in NEURON where everyexception results in NEURON calling `MPI_Abort` and shutting down thesimulation. If this leads to confusing failure modes please post an issue withyour Patch code to the GitHub repo!# Basic usageUse it like you would use NEURON. The wrapper doesn't make any changes to the interface,it just patches up some of the more frequent and ridiculous gotchas.Patch supplies a new HOC interpreter `p`, the `PythonHocInterpreter` which wraps thestandard HOC interpreter `h` provided by NEURON. Any objects returned will either be`PythonHocObject`'s wrapping their corresponding NEURON object, or whatever NEURONreturns.When using just Patch the difference between NEURON and Patch objects is handledtransparently, but if you wish to mix interpreters you can transform all Patch objectsback to NEURON objects with `obj.__neuron__()`.``` pythonfrom patch import pimport glia as gsection = p.Section()point_process = g.insert(section, &quot;AMPA&quot;)stim = p.NetStim()stim.start = 10stim.number = 5stim.interval = 10# And here comes the magic! This explicitly defined connection# isn't immediatly garbage collected! What a crazy world we live in.# Has science gone too far?p.NetCon(stim, point_process)# It's fully compatible using __neuron__from neuron import hnrn_section = h.Section()nrn_section.connect(section.__neuron__())```# Magic methods## \_\_neuron\_\__Get the object's NEURON pointer_Whenever an object with this method present is sent to the NEURON HOC interpreter, theresult of this method is passed instead. This allows Python methods to encapsulate NEURONpointers transparently## \_\_netcon\_\__Get the object's NetCon pointer_Whenever an object with this method present is used in a NetCon call, the result of thismethod is passed instead. The connection is stored on the original object. This allows tosimplify the calls to NetCon, or to add more elegant default behavior, like inserting theconnection on a random segment of a section and being able to use just ``p.NetCon(section,synapse)``</longdescription>

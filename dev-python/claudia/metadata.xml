	<longdescription># ClaudiaClaudia is a tool which helps make a few XRPL specific tasks look very easy. Tasks like running a local instance of rippled, managing a local network, managing a sidechain network, running tests and even learning a few neat tricks with XRPL in a quick fashion can be done effortlessly with this tool.Claudia was developed by the XRPL Automation Team as an internal tool to help with XRPL local development, debugging and testing. As the tool matured, the team quickly realized its potential and decided to expose it outside of Ripple, so that everyone can benefit from its capabilities. Following are some of the important tasks that can be performed using Claudia:- Build rippled from local code.- Install rippled from pre-built binaries released by Ripple.- Manage a local-mainnet network using local rippled instance.- Locally build a local witness server to start a sidechain network.- Manage a local-sidechain network.- Run unit tests on the built/installed rippled instance.- Run system tests on local-mainnet, local-sidechain, devnet and testnet networks.- Manage rippled features on the local-mainnet and local-sidechain networks.- Learn more about XRPL capabilities and perform real-time learning activities on local-mainnet, local-sidechain, devnet and testnet networks.---## General PrerequisitesClaudia can be installed on both macOS and Ubuntu. Currently, there is no support for Windows. Following prerequisites must be installed before installing Claudia:- [Python3](https://www.python.org/)  - Run ```python3 --version``` to check if Python3 is already installed.   - If Python3 is not installed, please install it using the official [Python installer](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  - Verify installation by running: ```python3 --version```- [pip3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)  - Run ```pip3 --version``` to check if Python3 is already installed.   - If pip3 is not installed, follow the next steps:    - macOS:       - ```python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade```    - Linux:      - ```sudo apt update```      - ```sudo apt install python3-pip```    - Verify installation by running: ```pip3 --version```- [docker](https://www.docker.com/)  - Run ```docker --version``` to check if docker is already installed.  - If docker is not installed, follow the next steps:    - macOS:      - Download and then run the [Docker Desktop installer for macOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/).    - Linux:      - Download and then run the [Docker Desktop installer for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/).-  Claudia allows its users to run System test using Javascript client library.

	<longdescription># djangoldp-stripeA DjangoLDP package supporting Stripe payments. Uses dependency [dj-stripe](https://github.com/dj-stripe/dj-stripe) to achieve much of the functionality, a library for handling Stripe payments in Django# Requirements* djangoldp 2.1* Python 3.6.5* Requires the installation of a [DjangoLDP server](https://docs.startinblox.com/import_documentation/djangoldp_guide/install-djangoldp-server.html)* You will need to set up a [Stripe client](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/dashboard)# Installation* You will need to set the following settings to your settings.yml:```yamldependencies:   # ...   - djangoldp-stripeldp_packages:   # ...   - djangoldp_stripeserver:   # ...   STRIPE_LIVE_MODE: True  # Should be False when testing, True in production   DJSTRIPE_USE_NATIVE_JSONFIELD: True  # if using SQLite, set this to False   DJSTRIPE_FOREIGN_KEY_TO_FIELD: &quot;id&quot;```* Set `STRIPE_LIVE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY` in your OS environment variables where the server is run. These settings will then be securely imported when you next configure. Alternatively, you can add them to the settings.yml:```yamlserver:    # ...    STRIPE_LIVE_SECRET_KEY: &quot;&quot;    STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY: &quot;&quot;```You can find these settings via the [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)* Optionally you can change the setting `LDP_STRIPE_URL_PATH` to change the path where Django Stripe's urls will be accessible. By default it is `&quot;stripe/&quot;`, i.e. `http://localhost:8080/stripe/`. These urls are provided by [DjStripe](https://github.com/dj-stripe/dj-stripe/blob/master/djstripe/urls.py) and implement all of the necessary webhooks to keep your Stripe data sync'ed with your Django data* In the Stripe dashboard, register a [webhook](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks) listening to all events (or just those you want to keep up-to-date) and point them to your API url + your webhook endpoint. So if your API was hosted on `https://yoursite.com/` and you didn't change the `LDP_STRIPE_URL_PATH`, then the endpoint would be `https://yoursite.com/stripe/webhooks/`* In the created webhooks, find your webhook secret, and set this in the OS variable (or server setting) `DJSTRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. It is a string which will start `whsec_`* Optionally add `djangoldp_stripe.middleware.StripeSubscriptionRequiredMiddleware` to your `MIDDLEWARE` settings in `settings.yml`. When this middleware is included then it will restrict access to certain requests so that they are only accessible by users with an active subscription. Add a list of all paths which should be restricted to the setting `INCLUDE_FROM_GLOBAL_STRIPE_SUBSCRIPTION_REQ````yamlserver:   # ...   MIDDLEWARE:     - &quot;djangoldp_stripe.middleware.StripeSubscriptionRequiredMiddleware&quot;   INCLUDE_FROM_GLOBAL_STRIPE_SUBSCRIPTION_REQ:     - '/my-custom-path/'```Note that this middleware does not check that an anonymous user is subscribed. To prevent this being a problem, make sure that your server does not give anonymous users permissions that they shouldn't have, so that they must login before accessing the application* Optionally add the setting `REDIRECT_URL_NO_SUBSCRIPTION` if you plan to use `UserHasValidSubscriptionView` and wish to modify its' behaviour, e.g. `http://localhost:8000/checkout-session/?lookup_key=test-subscription` or `http://localhost:8000/checkout-session/?price_id=price_1KOPEhIK99puQD1xtbSN94fk`* Run `djangoldp install`* Run `djangoldp configure`* Run `python manage.py djstripe_sync_models`. Anytime you run this command your database will be manually synchronised with your Stripe records. If for example your site went down for a time, you should re-run this command## Migrating existing customersAfter configuration, you can do this by running:```djangoldp configurepython manage.py djstripe_init_customerspython manage.py djstripe_sync_plans_from_stripe```# StripeSubscriptionPermissionsThis package can be used to provide custom permissions on your models and views. To do this you can use the permissions class `StripeSubscriptionPermissions` or the utility functions in `permissions.py`* Set up the required product permissions on your model:```pythonclass MyModel(Model):    # ...    class Meta(Model.Meta):       # ...       PERMS_REQUIRED_STRIPE_SUBSCRIPTIONS = ['prod_xxxx',]```When applying either the permission class to a `LDPViewSet` or the utility function, you can now control access based on the products a requesting user is subscribed to# ViewsMaking a GET request to `/user-valid-subscriptions/` will return in JSON-LD the serialized products which the authenticated user is subscribed to. It will only return those which are valid subscriptions (e.g. excluding those which have expired)```json{   &quot;@context&quot;: [...],   &quot;@type&quot;: &quot;ldp:Container&quot;,   &quot;@id&quot;: &quot;http://yourserver/user-valid-subscriptions/&quot;,   &quot;ldp:contains&quot;: [      {         &quot;name&quot;: &quot;My Awesome Product&quot;,         &quot;id&quot;: &quot;prod_xxxx&quot;      }   ]}```</longdescription>

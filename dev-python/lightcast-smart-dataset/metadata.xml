Get the occupation insights for an occupation in a area of UK  * `lightcast-smart-dataset uk occupation-insight soc --username=**** --password=**** --occupation=&quot;Programmers and software development professionals&quot; --area=&quot;Camden and City of London&quot;`  * `lightcast-smart-dataset uk occupation-insight occupation --username=***** --password=**** --occupation=&quot;Programmers and software development professionals&quot; --area=&quot;Camden and City of London&quot;`2. Get the occupation insights for software developers in Milan, Italy  * `lightcast-smart-dataset global occupation-insight occupation --username=***** --password=**** --occupation=&quot;Business Development / Sales Manager&quot; --area=&quot;Milan (ITA)&quot;  --occupation-level=3 --area-level=2`3. Get a taxonomy     * `lightcast-smart-dataset taxonomy soc4 --username=**** --password=****`### ResultsThe command line interface will create different Excel file with different sheets:- the current 12 months of unique job postings vs the last 12 months of unique job postings- the top 10 common skills, top 10 specialized skills in the area refered to the last 12 months for the requested occupation- the top 10 job tiles in the area refered to the last 12 months for the requested occupation- the top 10 employers in the area refered to the last 12 months for the requested occupation (only employers, no staffic company)### LicenseCopyright (c) 2022 LightcastPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copyof this software and associated documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to dealin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rightsto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sellcopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software isfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in allcopies or substantial portions of the Software.THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS ORIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Furthermore it is possible to map two ranges on to each other.This can be useful to convert between for example and 4 - 20 mA and 0 - 10 V, bothof them are common as sensor out- or input. Moreover, a subclass allows the mappingof a bit-range to any other range. For example a 12 bit number (0-4095) to 0 - 10.All utilities can be used with single numbers (:code:`int`,:code:`float`) as well as array-like structures containing single numbers(:code:`np.array()`, :code:`list`, :code:`dict`, :code:`tuple`).Currently the following sensors are implemented:- LEM LT 4000S- LMT 70AThe following unit conversion classes are implemented:- Temperature (Kelvin, Celsius, Fahrenheit)- Pressure (Pascal, Bar, Atmosphere, Psi, Torr, Millimeter Mercury)Documentation-------------Note: if you're planning to contribute to the :code:`hvl_ccb` project readthe **Contributing** section in the HVL CCB documentation.Do either:* read `HVL CCB documentation at RTD`_,or* build and read HVL CCB documentation locally; install first `Graphviz`_ (make sure  to have the :code:`dot` command in the executable search path) and the Python  build requirements for documentation::    $ pip install docs/requirements.txt  and then either on Windows in Git BASH run::    $ ./make.sh docs  or from any other shell with GNU Make installed run::    $ make docs  The target index HTML (:code:`&quot;docs/_build/html/index.html&quot;`) should open  automatically in your Web browser... _`Graphviz`: https://graphviz.org/.. _`HVL CCB documentation at RTD`: https://readthedocs.org/projects/hvl-ccb/Credits-------This package was created with Cookiecutter_ and the`audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`_ project template... _Cookiecutter: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter.. _`audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage</longdescription>

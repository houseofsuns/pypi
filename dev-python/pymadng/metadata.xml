	<longdescription># pymadngPython interface to MAD-NG running as subprocessInstall using below, see [The Python Package Index (PyPi)](https://pypi.org/project/pymadng/);`pip install pymadng`Familiarising yourself with pymadng===================================First, we recommend familiarising yourself with MAD-NG, documentation can be found [here](https://mad.web.cern.ch/mad/releases/madng/html/). Then reading through the Low-Level Example Explained on the [pymadng documentation](https://pymadng.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) should be sufficient (alongside knowledge of MAD-NG), assuming you are not planning to use any &quot;syntactic sugar&quot;. If you plan to use the available pythonic looking code, there are plenty of examples to look at. In the documentation, [FODO Examples Explained](https://pymadng.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ex-fodo.html), is a chapter that goes into detail on what is happening on each line of the [FODO example](https://github.com/MethodicalAcceleratorDesign/MADpy/blob/main/examples/ex-fodo/ex-fodos.py), while [LHC Example](https://pymadng.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ex-lhc-couplingLocal.html) gives an example of loading the LHC and how to grab intermediate results from a match. The only other example that may be of use is the [ps-twiss](https://github.com/MethodicalAcceleratorDesign/MADpy/blob/main/examples/ex-ps-twiss/ps-twiss.py) example. This is an extremely simple example, extending the FODO example to perform a twiss on the PS sequence.If anything does not seem fully explained, initially check the [API Reference](https://pymadng.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pymadng.html#module-pymadng) and/or the [MAD-NG Documentation](https://mad.web.cern.ch/mad/releases/madng/html/), then feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/MethodicalAcceleratorDesign/MADpy/issues) so improvements can be made.Documentation=============Documentation, including explanation of a couple of examples and the limitations of the API can be found [here](https://pymadng.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The API reference is also included in [this documentation](https://pymadng.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). You can also compile to documentation yourself by cloning the repository and running ``make html`` in the docs folder.Getting the examples working============================You can run the example with `python3 EXAMPLE_NAME.py`</longdescription>

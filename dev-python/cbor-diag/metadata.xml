	<longdescription>=======================================cbor-diag: Diagnostic notation for CBOR=======================================This Python module is a minimal wapper around the `cbor-diag crate`_.Unlike the crate,which offers lots of functionality for manipulating an AST,this module only exposes two very simple functions:* ``diag2cbor``, which parses diagnostic notation and produces a corresponding CBOR binary string, and* ``cbor2diag``, which does the inverse.It is recommended to use the cbor2_ package to actually process the CBOR data.Documentation is available `on readthedocs`_.Installation============This project can be installed `from PyPI`_;binary wheels are available there for the common platforms.Maintenance===========This package is considered feature-complete at release,and maintainened reactively --when changes to the ecosystem threaten to make it unusable.New features are only expected to be addedif they are already present in the underlying `cbor-diag crate`_,and will likely manifest as extra arguments to ``cbor2diag``.This package is built using maturin_ and pyo3_and largely follows their template.The built module is renamed from ``cbor_diag`` to ``_cbor_diag``(and consequently wrapped manually)to avoid it being part of the package's public API.The package is currently hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/chrysn/cbor-diag-pybecause maturin can `not yet`_ build pipelines for GitLab or codeberg.License=======This package was written by Christian Amsüss &lt;chrysn@fsfe.org&gt;,and is published under the terms of MIT_ or Apache-2.0_ license,at the user's choice.Credit for its functionality goes to Nemo157as the maintainer of the underlying `cbor-diag crate`_... _`cbor-diag crate`: https://crates.io/crates/cbor-diag.. _cbor2: https://pypi.org/project/cbor2/.. _`on readthedocs`: https://cbor-diag.readthedocs.io/.. _`from PyPI`: https://pypi.org/project/cbor-diag/.. _maturin: https://www.maturin.rs/.. _pyo3: https://pyo3.rs/.. _`not yet`: https://github.com/PyO3/maturin/issues/1507.. _MIT: https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html.. _Apache-2.0: https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0.html</longdescription>

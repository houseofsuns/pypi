It has several bin algorithms that NumPy does not have.2.  It can be used for plotting with an ultra-sort interface, for example:    ```python    import enstat    import numpy as np    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt    data = np.random.random(1000)    hist = enstat.histogram.from_data(data, bins=10, mode=&quot;log&quot;)    fig, ax = plt.subplots()    ax.plot(hist.x, hist.p)    plt.show()    ```    You can even use `ax.plot(*hist.plot)`.&lt;div id=&quot;readme-binned&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;## Average per binSuppose you have some time series (`t`) with multiple observables (`a` and `b`); e.g.;```pythonimport enstatimport numpy as npt = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)a = np.random.normal(loc=5, scale=0.1, size=t.size)b = np.random.normal(loc=1, scale=0.5, size=t.size)```Now suppose that you want to compute the average `a`, `b`, and `t` based on a certain binning of `t`:```pythonbin_edges = np.linspace(0, 12, 12)binned = enstat.binned.from_data(t, a, b, names=[&quot;t&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;]m bin_edges=bin_edges)print(binned[&quot;a&quot;].mean())```## Installation-   Using conda    ```bash    conda install -c conda-forge enstat    ```-   Using PyPi    ```bash    python -m pip install enstat    ```## DisclaimerThis library is free to use under the [MIT license](https://github.com/tdegeus/enstat/blob/master/LICENSE).Any additions are very much appreciated.As always, the code comes with no guarantee.None of the developers can be held responsible for possible mistakes.</longdescription>

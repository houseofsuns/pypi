It is mainly targeted for use with maps of the sky (e.g. CMB intensity and polarization maps, stacks of 21 cm intensity maps, binned galaxy positions or shear) in cylindrical projection, but its core functionality is more general. It extends numpy's ``ndarray`` to an ``ndmap`` class that associates a World Coordinate System (WCS) with a numpy array.  It includes tools for Fourier transforms  (through numpy or pyfft) and spherical harmonic transforms (through ducc0_) of such maps and tools for visualization (through the Python Image Library). * Free software: BSD license* Documentation: https://pixell.readthedocs.io.* Tutorials_Dependencies------------* Python&gt;=3.7* gcc/gfortran or Intel compilers (clang might not work out of the box), if compiling from source* ducc0_, healpy, Cython, astropy, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pyyaml, h5py, Pillow (Python Image Library)Installing----------Make sure your ``pip`` tool is up-to-date. To install ``pixell``, run:.. code-block:: console   $ pip install pixell --user   $ test-pixellThis will install a pre-compiled binary suitable for your system (only Linux and Mac OS X with Python&gt;=3.7 are supported). Note that you need ``~/.local/bin`` to be in your ``PATH`` for the latter ``test-pixell`` to work.If you require more control over your installation, e.g. using Intel compilers, please see the section below on compiling from source.  The ``test-pixell`` command will run a suite of unit tests.Compiling from source (advanced / development workflow)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~For compilation instructions specific to NERSC/cori, see NERSC_.For all other, below are general instructions.First, download the source distribution or ``git clone`` this repository. You can work from ``master`` or checkout one of the released version tags (see the Releases section on Github). Then change into the cloned/source directory.Run ``setup.py``~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~If not using Intel compilers (see below), build the package using .. code-block:: console   $ python setup.py build_ext -iYou may now test the installation:.. code-block:: console   $ py.test pixell/tests/   If the tests pass, either add the cloned directory to your ``$PYTHONPATH``, if you want the ability for changes made to Python source files to immediately reflect in your installation, e.g., in your ``.bashrc`` file,.. code-block:: bash   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/cloned/pixell/directoryor alternatively, install the package     .. code-block:: console   $ python setup.py install --userwhich requires you to reinstall every time changes are made to any files in your repository directory.   Intel compilers~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Intel compilers require you to modify the build step above as follows.. code-block:: console   $ python setup.py build_ext -i --fcompiler=intelem --compiler=intelemOn some systems, further specification might be required (make sure to get a fresh copy of the repository before trying out a new install method), e.g.:.. code-block:: console   $ LDSHARED=&quot;icc -shared&quot; LD=icc LINKCC=icc CC=icc python setup.py build_ext -i --fcompiler=intelem --compiler=intelemContributions-------------If you have write access to this repository, please:1. create a new branch2. push your changes to that branch3. merge or rebase to get in sync with master4. submit a pull request on githubIf you do not have write access, create a fork of this repository and proceed as described above.

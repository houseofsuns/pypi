	<longdescription># PyIAACSync## Introductioninfrastructure-as-code tools such as Terraform and Palumi gaining popularity and increasingly becoming neceessary to support the principles of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). However, there are a couple of disadvantages in existing tools in the market:- Terraform requires knowledge of golang to be able to sync assets- Both Terraform and Paulmi can be quite complex for beginners to manage and maintainPyIAACSync provides a framework which allows software engineering getting into infrastructure-as-code to easily create and sync assets which they have defined in YAML spec files, in a polled manner (non-event driven). The infrastructue can be `anything` (AWS asset, GCP asset, any SIEM detection rule) that Software engineers need to create the following:1. A folder (`iaac_sync_folder`) that contains the specs/configs for the infrastructure to create2. A simple asset python file that contains a class describing the asset with the following `static` functions:   - validate: to validate whether the spec/config that has been supplied in the    - create: to create the asset via the supplied spec/config   - delete: to delete that has been supplied via the spec/config   - check: to check whether the asset that has been deployed matches the spec/config aka `integrity check`. If not, the asset will be re-createdPlease see `Usage` section that describes the example in more detail## Install### via PyPI```python3 -m pip install pyiaacsync```### ManuallyInstall all necessary dependencies as follows:```python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt```## Usage### StructureWe will be using the example `example-fileasset` described in the `examples` folder of this repository. Users of this repo can use the files in the `examples` folder (especially `fileasset.py`) to build their own assets with `pyiaacsync.py`.In this folder, we have the following objects:- `exampleconf`: a folder which contains 3 spec/config files (1 file is in a subfolder) that describe what kind of file to create- `fileasset.py`: A python file that contains the fileasset which defines how to `validate` the spec config file, `create` asset from the spec / config file, `delete` the existing asset created from the config file and also `check` if the the created asset is different from the config file- `example.py`: the main script which will invoke the creation of assets using pyiaacsync conf fileNote that `pyiaacsync` also has an `args` option available in `__init__` which can be used to provide any additional optional parameters as a dict that can be used by the asset class. Uncomment the `random_args` set line in `example.py` to see how it can be used:```...    random_args = {}    ## uncomment line below to demonstrate how the random arguments can work    #random_args = {'message': 'hello world'}```### Actions#### initThe first steps is to execute `init` which will create a new state file `out-teststate.yaml`:```python3 example.py -a init```To force re-creation of the state file even if it exists (NOTE: Beware this will delete the existing state file!):```python3 example.py -a init -if```We can also specify an existing state file to use:```python3 example.py -a init -if -f /tmp/out-teststatefile.yaml```#### validate_configsTo validate the configs in the spec folder for all existing assets using the `validate` function defined in `fileasset.py` class:```python3 example.py -a validate_configs```#### syncTo sync the assets based on the spec/configs folder continuously - this will create the files as per the configs in the folder.Any changes made to the files the next time will be reset.```python3 example.py -a sync```To sync the assets once only:```python3 example.py -a sync_once```#### delete_assetsTo delete all existing assets (in this case, all files) and remove the assets from the state file:```python3 example.py -a delete_assets```## TODO- Add unit testing</longdescription>

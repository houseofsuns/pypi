Guardrails:- does pydantic-style validation of LLM outputs (including semantic validation such as checking for bias in generated text, checking for bugs in generated code, etc.)- takes corrective actions (e.g. reasking LLM) when validation fails,- enforces structure and type guarantees (e.g. JSON).## 🚒 Under the hoodGuardrails provides a file format (`.rail`) for enforcing a specification on an LLM output, and a lightweight wrapper around LLM API calls to implement this spec.1. `rail` (**R**eliable **AI** markup **L**anguage) files for specifying structure and type information, validators and corrective actions over LLM outputs.2. `gd.Guard` wraps around LLM API calls to structure, validate and correct the outputs.``` mermaidgraph LR    A[Create `RAIL` spec] --&gt; B[&quot;Initialize `guard` from spec&quot;];    B --&gt; C[&quot;Wrap LLM API call with `guard`&quot;];```Check out the [Getting Started](https://shreyar.github.io/guardrails/getting_started) guide to learn how to use Guardrails.### 📜 `RAIL` specAt the heart of Guardrails is the `rail` spec. `rail` is intended to be a language-agnostic, human-readable format for specifying structure and type information, validators and corrective actions over LLM outputs.`rail` is a flavor of XML that lets users specify:1. the expected structure and types of the LLM output (e.g. JSON)2. the quality criteria for the output to be considered valid (e.g. generated text should be bias-free, generated code should be bug-free)3. and corrective actions to be taken if the output is invalid (e.g. reask the LLM, filter out the invalid output, etc.)To learn more about the `RAIL` spec and the design decisions behind it, check out the [docs](https://shreyar.github.io/guardrails/rail). To learn how to write your own `RAIL` spec, check out [this link](https://shreyar.github.io/guardrails/rail/output).## 📦 Installation```pythonpip install guardrails-ai```## 📍 Roadmap- [ ] Adding more examples, new use cases and domains- [ ] Adding integrations with langchain, gpt-index, minichain, manifest- [ ] Expanding validators offering- [ ] More compilers from `.rail` -&gt; LLM prompt (e.g. `.rail` -&gt; TypeScript)- [ ] Informative logging- [ ] Improving reasking logic- [ ] A guardrails.js implementation- [ ] VSCode extension for `.rail` files- [ ] Next version of `.rail` format- [ ] Add more LLM providers## 🚀 Getting StartedLet's go through an example where we ask an LLM to explain what a &quot;bank run&quot; is in a tweet, and generate URLs to relevant news articles. We'll generate a `.rail` spec for this and then use Guardrails to enforce it. You can see more examples in the docs.### 📝 Creating a `RAIL` specWe create a `RAIL` spec to describe the expected structure and types of the LLM output, the quality criteria for the output to be considered valid, and corrective actions to be taken if the output is invalid.Using `RAIL`, we:- Request the LLM to generate an object with two fields: `explanation` and `follow_up_url`.- For the `explanation` field, ensure the max length of the generated string should be between 200 and 280 characters.  - If the explanation is not of valid length, `reask` the LLM.- For the `follow_up_url` field, the URL should be reachable.  - If the URL is not reachable, we will `filter` it out of the response.```xml&lt;rail version=&quot;0.1&quot;&gt;&lt;output&gt;    &lt;object name=&quot;bank_run&quot; format=&quot;length: 2&quot;&gt;        &lt;string            name=&quot;explanation&quot;            description=&quot;A paragraph about what a bank run is.&quot;            format=&quot;length: 200 280&quot;            on-fail-length=&quot;reask&quot;        /&gt;        &lt;url            name=&quot;follow_up_url&quot;            description=&quot;A web URL where I can read more about bank runs.&quot;            format=&quot;valid-url&quot;            on-fail-valid-url=&quot;filter&quot;        /&gt;    &lt;/object&gt;&lt;/output&gt;&lt;prompt&gt;Explain what a bank run is in a tweet.@xml_prefix_prompt{output_schema}@json_suffix_prompt_v2_wo_none&lt;/prompt&gt;&lt;/rail&gt;```We specify our quality criteria (generated length, URL reachability) in the `format` fields of the `RAIL` spec below. We `reask` if `explanation` is not valid, and filter the `follow_up_url` if it is not valid.### 🛠️ Using Guardrails to enforce the `RAIL` specNext, we'll use the `RAIL` spec to create a `Guard` object. The `Guard` object will wrap the LLM API call and enforce the `RAIL` spec on its output.```pythonimport guardrails as gdguard = gd.Guard.from_rail(f.name)```The `Guard` object compiles the `RAIL` specification and adds it to the prompt. (Right now this is a passthrough operation, more compilers are planned to find the best way to express the spec in a prompt.)Here's what the prompt looks like after the `RAIL` spec is compiled and added to it.```xmlExplain what a bank run is in a tweet.Given below is XML that describes the information to extract from this document and the tags to extract it into.&lt;output&gt;    &lt;object name=&quot;bank_run&quot; format=&quot;length: 2&quot;&gt;        &lt;string name=&quot;explanation&quot; description=&quot;A paragraph about what a bank run is.&quot; format=&quot;length: 200 280&quot; on-fail-length=&quot;reask&quot; /&gt;        &lt;url name=&quot;follow_up_url&quot; description=&quot;A web URL where I can read more about bank runs.&quot; required=&quot;true&quot; format=&quot;valid-url&quot; on-fail-valid-url=&quot;filter&quot; /&gt;    &lt;/object&gt;&lt;/output&gt;ONLY return a valid JSON object (no other text is necessary). The JSON MUST conform to the XML format, including any types and format requests e.g. requests for lists, objects and specific types. Be correct and concise.JSON Output:```Call the `Guard` object with the LLM API call as the first argument and add any additional arguments to the LLM API call as the remaining arguments.```pythonimport openai# Wrap the OpenAI API call with the `guard` objectraw_llm_output, validated_output = guard(    openai.Completion.create,    engine=&quot;text-davinci-003&quot;,    max_tokens=1024,    temperature=0.3)print(validated_output)``````python{    'bank_run': {        'explanation': 'A bank run is when a large number of people withdraw their deposits from a bank due to concerns about its solvency. This can cause a financial crisis if the bank is unable to meet the demand for withdrawals.',        'follow_up_url': 'https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankrun.asp'    }}```## 🚴 Guardrails Activity ReportTo help the Guardrails community stay informed about the project's progress, [Blueprint AI](https://blueprint.ai) has developed a Github activity summarizer for Guardrails.

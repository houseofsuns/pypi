	<longdescription># PSBSThe PuzzleScript Build System!PSBS combines multiple files into one puzzlescript source file and can export it to an HTML file or an online game hosted on a gist!For more information view the [official PSBS Documentation](https://jcmiller11.github.io/PSBS/)![Screenshot of PSBS in action](https://github.com/jcmiller11/psbs/blob/master/docs/media/screenshot.png?raw=true)## Features - Compile PuzzleScript games from many files using Jinja2 templates! - Import images and spritesheets directly into your PuzzleScript game! - Load existing PuzzleScript projects right from their gists! - Load existing PuzzleScript projects from a source text file! - Export PuzzleScript projects to html files! - Export PuzzleScript projects to gists! - Launch your project from play.html or the PuzzleScript editor! - Supports most PuzzleScript forks! - Use your favorite version control for your PuzzleScript projects! - [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) level editor integration! - Extensible with your own custom Python extensions!## InstallingIf you already have Python 3.8 or greater and pip installed simply run the following command from your terminal`pip install psbs`If you don't have Python and pip installed: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)If you already have an older version of PSBS installed you can upgrade to the latest version with`pip install psbs --upgrade`## ContributingWhile I'd be grateful to receive pull requests, at this moment in time prior to doing an official 1.0.0 release what I would really like help with is testing!  Please use PSBS to its fullest and if you encounter any odd behaviors don't hesitate to raise an Issue!I would like PSBS to have friendly error handling that returns nice, brief, and useful error messages rather than a full stack trace, however it's challenging to make sure I've caught every possible exception, so if you run into a stack trace while using PSBS please raise an Issue!</longdescription>

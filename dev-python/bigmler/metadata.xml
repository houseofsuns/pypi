	<longdescription>BigMLer - A command-line tool for BigML's API=============================================BigMLer makes `BigML &lt;https://bigml.com&gt;`_ even easier.BigMLer wraps `BigML's API Python bindings &lt;http://bigml.readthedocs.org&gt;`_  tooffer a high-level command-line script to easily create and publish datasetsand models, create ensembles,make local predictions from multiple models, and simplify many other machinelearning tasks. For additional information, seethe`full documentation for BigMLer on Read the Docs &lt;http://bigmler.readthedocs.org&gt;`_.BigMLer is open sourced under the `Apache License, Version2.0 &lt;http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html&gt;`_.Support=======Please report problems and bugs to our `BigML.io issuetracker &lt;https://github.com/bigmlcom/io/issues&gt;`_.Discussions about the different bindings take place in the general`BigML mailing list &lt;http://groups.google.com/group/bigml&gt;`_. Or join usin our `Campfire chatroom &lt;https://bigmlinc.campfirenow.com/f20a0&gt;`_.Requirements============BigMLer needs Python 3.8 or higher versions to work.Compatibility with Python 2.X was discontinued in version 3.27.2.BigMLer requires `bigml 9.1.3 &lt;https://github.com/bigmlcom/python&gt;`_  orhigher, that contains the bindings providing support to use the ``BigML``platform to create, update, get and delete resources,but also to produce local predictions using themodels created in ``BigML``. Most of them will be actionable with the basicinstallation, but some additional dependencies are neededto use local ``Topic Models`` to produce ``Topic Distributions``. These canbe installed using:.. code-block:: bash    pip install bigmler[topics]The bindings also support local predictions for models generated from images.To use these models, an additional set of libraries needs to be installedusing:.. code-block:: bash    pip install bigmler[images]The external libraries used in this case exist for the majority of recentOperating System versions. Still, some of them might need especificcompiler versions or dlls, so their installation may require an additionalsetup effort.The full set of libraries can be installed using.. code-block:: bash    pip install bigmler[full]BigMLer Installation====================To install the latest stable release with`pip &lt;http://www.pip-installer.org/&gt;`_.. code-block:: bash    $ pip install bigmlerYou can also install the development version of bigmler directlyfrom the Git repository.. code-block:: bash    $ pip install -e git://github.com/bigmlcom/bigmler.git#egg=bigmlerFor a detailed description of install instructions on Windows see the:ref:bigmler-on-windows section.Support for local Topic Distributions (Topic Models' predictions)and local predictions for datasets that include Images will only beavailable as extras, because the libraries used for that are notusually available in all Operating Systems. If you need to support those,please check the `Installation Extras &lt;#installation-extras&gt;`_ section.Installation Extras===================Local Topic Distributions support can be installed using:.. code-block:: bash    pip install bigmler[topics]Images local predictions support can be installed using:.. code-block:: bash    pip install bigmler[images]The full set of features can be installed using:.. code-block:: bash    pip install bigmler[full]WARNING: Mind that installing these extras can require some extra work, asexplained in the :ref:requirements section.BigML Authentication====================All the requests to BigML.io must be authenticated using your usernameand `API key &lt;https://bigml.com/account/apikey&gt;`_ and are alwaystransmitted over HTTPS.BigML module will look for your username and API key in the environmentvariables ``BIGML_USERNAME`` and ``BIGML_API_KEY`` respectively. You canadd the following lines to your ``.bashrc`` or ``.bash_profile`` to setthose variables automatically when you log in.. code-block:: bash    export BIGML_USERNAME=myusername    export BIGML_API_KEY=ae579e7e53fb9abd646a6ff8aa99d4afe83ac291Otherwise, you can initialize directly when running the BigMLerscript as follows.. code-block:: bash    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --username myusername \            --api-key ae579e7e53fb9abd646a6ff8aa99d4afe83ac291For a detailed description of authentication instructions on Windows see the`BigMLer on Windows &lt;#bigmler-on-windows&gt;`_ section.BigMLer on Windows==================To install BigMLer on Windows environments, you'll need `Python for Windows(v.2.7.x) &lt;http://www.python.org/download/&gt;`_ installed.In addition to that, you'll need the ``pip`` tool to install BigMLer. Toinstall pip, first you need to open your command line window (write ``cmd`` inthe input field that appears when you click on ``Start`` and hit ``enter``),download this `python file &lt;http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py&gt;`_and execute it.. code-block:: bash    c:\Python27\python.exe distribute_setup.pyAfter that, you'll be able to install ``pip`` by typing the following command.. code-block:: bash    c:\Python27\Scripts\easy_install.exe pipAnd finally, to install BigMLer, just type.. code-block:: bash    c:\Python27\Scripts\pip.exe install bigmlerand BigMLer should be installed in your computer. Thenissuing.. code-block:: bash    bigmler --versionshould show BigMLer version information.Finally, to start using BigMLer to handle your BigML resources, you need toset your credentials in BigML for authentication. If you want them to bepermanently stored in your system, use.. code-block:: bash    setx BIGML_USERNAME myusername    setx BIGML_API_KEY ae579e7e53fb9abd646a6ff8aa99d4afe83ac291BigML Development Mode======================Also, you can instruct BigMLer to work in BigML's Sandboxenvironment by using the parameter ``---dev``.. code-block:: bash    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --devUsing the development flag you can run tasks under 1 MB without spending any ofyour BigML credits.Using BigMLer=============To run BigMLer you can use the console script directly. The `--help` option willdescribe all the available options.. code-block:: bash    bigmler --helpAlternatively you can just call bigmler as follows.. code-block:: bash    python bigmler.py --helpThis will display the full list of optional arguments. You can read a briefexplanation for each option below.Quick Start===========Let's see some basic usage examples. Check the `installation` and `authentication`sections in `BigMLer on Read the Docs &lt;http://bigmler.readthedocs.org&gt;`_ ifyou are not familiar with BigML.Basics------You can create a new model just with.. code-block:: bash    bigmler --train data/iris.csvIf you check your `dashboard at BigML &lt;https://bigml.com/dashboard&gt;`_, you willsee a new source, dataset, and model. Isn't it magic?You can generate predictions for a test set using.. code-block:: bash    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --test data/test_iris.csvYou can also specify a file name to save the newly created predictions.. code-block:: bash    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --test data/test_iris.csv --output predictionsIf you do not specify the path to an output file, BigMLer will auto-generateone for you under anew directory named after the current date and time(e.g., `MonNov1212_174715/predictions.csv`).With ``--prediction-info``flag set to ``brief`` only the prediction result will be stored (default is``normal`` and includes confidence information).A different ``objective field`` (the field that you want to predict) canbe selected using.. code-block:: bash    bigmler --train data/iris.csv  \            --test data/test_iris.csv \            --objective 'sepal length'If you do not explicitly specify an objective field, BigML willdefault to the lastcolumn in your dataset.Also, if your test file uses a particular field separator for its data,you can tell BigMLer using ``--test-separator``.For example, if your test file uses the tab character as field separator thecall should be like.. code-block:: bash    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --test data/test_iris.tsv \            --test-separator '\t'If you don't provide a file name for your training source, BigMLer will try toread it from the standard input.. code-block:: bash    cat data/iris.csv | bigmler --trainBigMLer will try to use the locale of the model both to create a new source(if ``--train`` flag is used) and to interpret test data. In caseit fails, it will try ``en_US.UTF-8``or ``English_United States.1252`` and a warning message will be printed.If you want to change this behaviour you can specify your preferred locale.. code-block:: bash    bigmler --train data/iris.csv --test data/test_iris.csv \    --locale &quot;English_United States.1252&quot;If you check your working directory you will see that BigMLer creates a filewith themodel ids that have been generated (e.g., FriNov0912_223645/models).This file is handy if then you want to use those model ids to generate localpredictions. BigMLer also creates a file with the dataset id that has beengenerated (e.g., TueNov1312_003451/dataset) and another one summarizingthe steps taken in the session progress: ``bigmler_sessions``. You can alsostore a copy of every created or retrieved resource in your output directory(e.g., TueNov1312_003451/model_50c23e5e035d07305a00004f) by setting the flag``--store``.Prior Versions Compatibility Issues-----------------------------------BigMLer will accept flags written with underscore as word separator like``--clear_logs`` for compatibility with prior versions. Also ``--field-names``is accepted, although the more complete ``--field-attributes`` flag ispreferred. ``--stat_pruning`` and ``--no_stat_pruning`` are discontinuedand their effects can be achived by setting the actual ``--pruning`` flagto ``statistical`` or ``no-pruning`` values respectively.Running the Tests-----------------The tests will be run using `pytest &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/&gt;`_.You'll need to set up your authenticationvia environment variables, as explained in the authentication section.Also some of the tests need other environmentvariables like ``BIGML_ORGANIZATION`` to test calls when used by Organizationmembers and ``BIGML_EXTERNAL_CONN_HOST``, ``BIGML_EXTERNAL_CONN_PORT``,``BIGML_EXTERNAL_CONN_DB``, ``BIGML_EXTERNAL_CONN_USER``,``BIGML_EXTERNAL_CONN_PWD`` and ``BIGML_EXTERNAL_CONN_SOURCE``in order to test external data connectors.With that in place, you can run the test suite simply by issuing.. code-block:: bash    $ pytestAdditional Information----------------------For additional information, seethe `full documentation for BigMLer on Read the Docs &lt;http://bigmler.readthedocs.org&gt;`_... :changelog:History-------5.4.0 (2023-01-10)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- Changing test tool to pytest.- Updating underlying bindings version.- Changing header for centroid local predictions to `cluster` to match  remote header.5.3.0 (2022-10-21)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- Updating underlying bindings version.- Fixing bigmler delete query for synchronous resources.5.2.0 (2022-09-30)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- Adding Image Feature Extraction options.- Adding local prediction for Images classification, regression and object  detection.- Improving souce naming.5.1.0 (2022-09-21)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- Upgrading dependencies.- Improving bigmler delete subcommand.- Moving the default output directory to `.bigmler_outputs` in the current  working directory.5.0.0 (2022-03-26)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- Adding support for composites of images.- Adding --id-fields to bigmler anomaly.- Adding OptiML to the bigmler delete list of resources.- Cloning first if trying to update a closed source.4.1.1 (2021-05-04)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- Changing the ascii used in output to console to avoid problems with  Windows encodings.- Updating copyright4.1.0 (2020-09-11)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- Updating the underlying Python bindings version to use minized models in  local predictions.4.0.0 (2020-08-01)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- Python 3 only version.

To check which versionof Python you have, run `python --version`. If you have both Python 2 andPython 3 installed, you may need to check with `python3 --version`. If this isthe case, you will also need to use `pip3` instead of `pip` below.Install with pip:.. code-block:: python    pip install cfde-submitUsage=====This tool can ingest any of the following into DERIVA:1. A directory to be formatted into a BDBag2. A premade BDBag directory3. A premade BDBag in an archive fileIn all cases, the data must already be in CFDE TableSchema format, or theingest may fail. See instructions here (link to docs pending).Command line------------There are four commands available: `run`, `status`, `login`, `logout`, and `reset`.Use them as follows:- ``cfde-submit run DATA-PATH`` will ingest the data found at ``DATA-PATH`` into  CFDE. You can also specify the following options:  - ``--output-dir=OUTPUT_DIR`` will copy the data in ``DATA-PATH``, if it is a     directory, to the location you specify, which must not exist and must not    be inside ``DATA-PATH``. The resulting BDBag will be named after the output    directory. If not specified, the BDBag will be created in-place in    ``DATA_PATH`` if necessary.  - ``--delete-dir`` will trigger deletion of the ``output-dir`` after processing    is complete. If you didn't specify ``output-dir``, this option has no effect.  - ``--ignore-git`` will prevent the client from overwriting ``output-dir`` and ``delete-dir`` to handle Git repositories.- ``cfde-submit status`` will check the status of a Flow instance.- ``cfde-submit login`` will start the login process. If you have tokens saved  from a previous login, this command will validate those tokens and only  re-authenticate you if they are expired. It is not necessary to run this  command before ``run`` or ``status``, because those commands will also  authenticate you if needed.- ``cfde-submit logout`` will log you out and revoke any valid cached tokens.- ``cfde-submit reset`` will reset your cfde-submit configuration.Python API----------The ``CfdeClient`` class, once instantiated, has the following methods:- ``start_deriva_flow(self, data_path, catalog_id=None, output_dir=None, delete_dir=False, **kwargs)``- ``check_status(self, flow_id=None, flow_instance_id=None, raw=False)``- ``logout(self)``The arguments operate in the same fashion as the CLI options, and aredocumented in detail in the method docstrings.</longdescription>

	<longdescription>twiggy-goodies==============[![ChangeLog](http://allmychanges.com/p/python/twiggy-goodies/badge/?rnd=1)](http://allmychanges.com/p/python/twiggy-goodies/)Here you'll find some useful addons to [Twiggy], pythonic logger.These addons help to use Twiggy with third-party libraries, whichuse standart library's [logging][].Main target was to create convenient way to write log itemswhich are grouped by some request identifier. Twiggy alreadysupports it by it's `fields` method, but sometimes it is tooinconvenient to pass logger object around. That is why I takeidea of a threadlocal loggers stack from the [logbook][] andimplemented it for twiggy.Here is example how to use it:    from twiggy_goodies.setup import setup_logging    from twiggy_goodies.threading import log    def some_function():        log.info('inner function does not accept logger')        log.info('but uses same field as caller')    setup_logging(None)    log.info('before request')    with log.fields(request_id='foo'):        log.info('bar has happened')        some_function()    log.info('after request, id gone')Output will be, as expected:    2014-04-14T18:29:02Z:INFO:before request    2014-04-14T18:29:02Z:INFO:request_id=foo:bar has happened    2014-04-14T18:29:02Z:INFO:request_id=foo:inner function does not accept logger    2014-04-14T18:29:02Z:INFO:request_id=foo:but uses same field as caller    2014-04-14T18:29:02Z:INFO:after request, id goneSame way, logger name could be changed, just replace `fields` contextmanager to `name`.There is no dark magick behind the scene: 1) setup_logging does simple setup and redirects all output   from standart `logging` to twiggy.2) `log` object is proxies all logging methods to a topmost   logger on the thread-local stack.3) `fields` and `name` context managers just create a new   logger as original twiggy's methods and put it on thread-local   stack.That is it.Some other goodies------------------  * `twiggy_goodies.syslog` contains `SysLogOutput`.  * `twiggy_goodies.json` contains `JsonOutput`, useful    to pass data to logstash.  * `twiggy_goodies.logstash` contains `LogstashOutput`,    which sends messages directly to Logstash's UDP port.  * `twiggy_goodies.django_rq` contains `job` decorator, which    groups all messages logged from one task, using UUID.  * `twiggy_goodies.django` contains `LogMixin` class which    could be mixed to any management command, to group all    logged messages by single UUID.  * `twiggy_goodies.django` also contains `LogMiddleware`, to    do the same as `LogMixin`, but for each http request.[Twiggy]: https://github.com/wearpants/twiggy[logging]: https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html[logbook]: http://pythonhosted.org//Logbook/</longdescription>

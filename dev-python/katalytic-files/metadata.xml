A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.[![version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/katalytic-files)](https://pypi.org/project/katalytic-files/)[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/katalytic/katalytic-files.svg?branch=main)](https://app.travis-ci.com/gitlab/katalytic/katalytic-files)[![Test Results](https://img.shields.io/travis/com/katalytic/katalytic-files?label=tests)](https://app.travis-ci.com/gitlab/katalytic/katalytic-files)[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/gitlab/katalytic/katalytic-files/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/gitlab/katalytic/katalytic-files?branch=main)[![Docs Coverage](https://img.shields.io/readthedocs/katalytic-files.svg)](https://katalytic-files.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)## InstallationBy itself```bashpip install katalytic-files```As part of the [katalytic](https://gitlab.com/katalytic/katalytic) collection```bashpip install katalytic```## UsageTODO: Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can.

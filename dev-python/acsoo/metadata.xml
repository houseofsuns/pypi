Releasing is automated via .gitlab-ci. Seethe `build` stage in the project template.**Perform ``acsoo tag``, ``acsoo tag_requirements`` and``acsoo wheel`` in one command.acsoo flake8------------**This command is deprecated, use a .flake8 file in your project,in combination with pre-commit. See the project template for a reasonable default.**Run `flake8 &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8&gt;`_ with sensible default for Odoo code.It is possible to pass additional options to the ``flake8`` command, eg:  .. code:: shell    acsoo flake8 -- --ignore E24,W504acsoo pylint------------**This command is deprecated, use a .pylintrc file in your project,in combination with pre-commit. See the project template for a reasonable default.**Run `pylint &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pylint&gt;`_ on detected Odoo addons in odoo/addons,odoo_addons or the current directory.It automatically uses the `pylint-odoo &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pylint-odoo&gt;`_ plugin andruns with a reasonable configuration, including an opinionated set of disabled message.It is possible to pass additional options to the ``pylint`` command, eg:  .. code:: shell    acsoo pylint -- --disable missing-final-newlineThis command returns an non-zero exit code if any message is reported.It is however possibly to display messages while reporting success, eg:  .. code:: shell    acsoo pylint --expected api-one-deprecated:2,line-too-longThe above command succeeds despite having exactly 2 ``api-one-deprecated`` orany number of ``line-too-long`` messages being reported.It is also possible to force failure on messages that are ``expected`` in thedefault configuration, eg to fail on ``fixme`` errors, just expect 0 ``fixme``messages, like this:  .. code:: shell    acsoo pylint --expected fixme:0acsoo.cfg~~~~~~~~~A file named ``acsoo.cfg`` at the project root helps you set sensible defaults.Here is a minimal example:  .. code:: ini    [acsoo]    trigram=xyz    series=10.0    version=1.5.0And a more elaborate example:  .. code:: ini    [acsoo]    trigram=xyz    series=11.0    version=1.5.2    pushable=      github.com:acsone      github.com:mozaik    [checklog]    ignore=      WARNING .* module .*: description is empty !

Future (?).. ----------.. -3.1.0 (2021-01-04)------------------- pr-status: detect PR status from github pull requests URLs found in requirement files;  useful to detect them in comments- Various improvements to the project template (in gitlab-ci.yml, and  pre-commit config, mostly) `#75 &lt;https://github.com/acsone/acsoo/pull/75&gt;`_,  `#77 &lt;https://github.com/acsone/acsoo/pull/77&gt;`_.- In acsoo tag, do not complain about empty directories `#76  &lt;https://github.com/acsone/acsoo/pull/76&gt;`_.- Deprecate ``acsoo freeze`` in favor of ``pip-deepfreeze``.- Deprecate ``acsoo addons`` in favor of ``manifestoo``.- Add license and development status check to project template.- Remove bumpversion from acsoo dependencies. This project is now replaced by  bump2versions, and it's better to install it separately with pipx.3.0.2 (2020-10-14)------------------- Lift setuptools version restriction.  It has https issues with pypi.org since 2020-10-14.  his means odoo-autodiscover&gt;=2 must be used  on Odoo&lt;=10 projects.  See also https://github.com/acsone/setuptools-odoo/issues/10.3.0.1 (2020-07-29)------------------- [REM] Remove mrbob dependency as pip &gt;= 20.2 make install crash3.0.0 (2020-07-01)------------------- [DEL] drop python 2 support (previous versions of acsoo are still available  on PyPI, and for regular use, the python 3 version works for Odoo 8, 9, 10  projects too)- [ADD] acsoo freeze to limit pip freeze output to dependencies of a given  distribution- [ADD] acsoo pr-status to print the status of GitHub pull requests  found in requirement files with revision of the form refs/pull/NNN/head- [DEL] deprecate ``acsoo wheel`` (now supported by pip natively) and  ``acsoo release`` (which is automated in GitLab CI)- [IMP] project template: ci.skip when pushing translation updates2.1.0 (2020-05-25)------------------- [IMP] project template: better and simpler isort config- [IMP] project template: merge request templates- [IMP] support non-editable VCS requirements in tag_requirements command- [DEL] remove --force option of tag_requirements command  as it does nothing useful, since all we want of this command  is to make sure that a tag is present- [MNT] declarative setuptools configuration- [IMP] pin flake8 to version 3.7.9 (reminder: acsoo flake8 is deprecated,  use pre-commit instead)- [IMP] pin pylint-odoo to version 3.1.0 (reminder: acsoo pylint is deprecated,  use pre-commit instead)2.0.0 (2020-01-15)------------------- [IMP] project template: publish html coverage in gitlab-ci- [IMP] project template: branch coverage in gitlab-ci- [IMP] project template: pre-commit cache in gitlab-ci- [DEL] deprecate acsoo pylint in favor of pre-commit and per project .pylintrc- [IMP] Odoo 13 support- [IMP] project template: rename requirements-dev.txt to requirements.txt.in,  better reflecting that these are input requirements and not requirements  for the development environment- [IMP] project template: update copyright year- [IMP] project template: remove module_auto_update, use click-odoo-update instead1.9.0 (2019-02-28)------------------- [IMP] project template: use pre-commit (black, isort, flake8)- [FIX] project template: fail on click-odoo-update error- [FIX] project template: fix deploy log file- [FIX] acsoo pylint: compatibility with pylint 21.8.3 (2019-01-22)------------------- [FIX] acsoo pylint: Adapt config to also work with pytlint-odoo 2.0.1- [IMP] project template: use click-odoo-update1.8.2 (2018-11-05)------------------- [IMP] project template: better way to declare python version  in .gitlab-ci.yml- Fix acsoo tag for Odoo 121.8.1 (2018-10-30)------------------- [IMP] ignore pylint C0303 (https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/289)1.8.0 (2018-10-29)------------------- [IMP] acsoo wheel: add --no-deps, so we can build requirements.txt without  fetching dependencies, and later install the project with --no-index and  --find-links=release/ so as to detect missing dependencies (#38)- [IMP] acsoo wheel: add --exclude-project option (to build requirements.txt  without the current project), in preparation of #44- [IMP] acsoo wheel: use a cache of editable git dependencies- [IMP] acsoo wheel: use pip wheel -e . to build project instead of  setup.py bdist_wheel, since the reason we were doing that has apparently  been resolved in recent pip version (pip issue 3499 referred in a comment  is apparently unrelated unfortunately, so I'm not sure why we were  doing that exactly, probably https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3500)- [IMP] flake8: ignore W503 and W504 by default (line break around logical  operators)- [IMP] project template: Odoo 12 support- [IMP] project template: pin acsoo version- [IMP] project template: acsoo wheel --no-deps, so, combined with  pip install --no-index in the test stage, it verifies that all dependencies  are included in requirements.txt1.7.1 (2018-07-15)------------------- [IMP] project template: add makepot in .gitlab-ci.yml- [IMP] pylint: whitelist lxml c library1.7.0 (2018-06-04)------------------- [IMP] more python 3 and Odoo 11 support- [IMP] project template: build stage in gitlab-ci- [IMP] project template: new style deploy / upgrade  (using checksum upgrades and click-odoo-upgrade script)- [IMP] project template: enforce odoo-autodiscover&gt;=2 and do not use it  for Odoo &gt;= 11- [IMP] add --dry-run option to acsoo tag and tag_requirements- [IMP] make the list of places where tag_requirements can push  configurable- [IMP] project template: on demand installation of acsoo and ssh-agent- [IMP] project template: use click-odoo-initdb in gitlab-ci1.6.0 (2018-02-16)------------------- [IMP] checklog: add --no-err-if-empty option- [IMP] python 3 support- [IMP] preliminary Odoo 11 support- [IMP] project template: various improvements- [IMP] refactoring of get_installable_addons() method for better reusability1.5.0 (2017-09-19)------------------- [IMP] tag_requirements: fetch more aggressively; this solves the errors  trying to write ref with non existent object- [IMP] tag: always tag requirements when doing acsoo tag- [IMP] tag: tag requirements before tagging project, so if something fails  when tagging the requirements the project is not tagged and the release  build is not triggered.- [ADD] addons: add --separator option (and fix tests that were not testing much)- [IMP] addons: consider current dir as addons dir candidate- [IMP] pylint: look for module to test in current dir by default, using the  same algorithm as ``addons list``- [IMP] pylint: support python 3 style odoo/addons namespace (without __init__.py)1.4.3 (2017-06-16)------------------- [IMP] checklog: consider ignore lines starting with # as comments- [FIX] checklog: the previous release broke checklog color output1.4.2 (2017-06-16)------------------- [IMP] checklog: fail if no log record found in input- [IMP] checklog: echo with click to be less sensitive to unicode issues1.4.1 (2017-06-14)------------------- [FIX] regression in acsoo release1.4.0 (2017-06-13)------------------- [IMP] colored logging- [IMP] major change to acsoo tag and tag_editable_requirements. These changes  make it easier to work with a CI-driven release process that is triggered on  new tags. The usual manual ``acsoo release`` process should be mostly unimpacted by  these changes.  - ``tag_editable_requirements`` is now ``tag_requirements``.  - the tags structure has changed from ``{series}-{trigram}_{version}`` to    ``{series}-{trigram}-{req_sha}-{egg}``, where ``{req_sha}`` is the sha of the    last change to ``requirements.txt``.  - ``tag_requirements`` includes the egg name in the tag so different commits    in the same repo can be tagged (before, all addons in a given dependency repo had    to be on the same commit).  - when a tag for the given series, trigram and egg already exists on the    dependency commit, ``tag_requirements`` does not attempt to create another    tag (this avoids creating useless tags or forced tags) and    this is sufficient because the sole purpose of these dependency tags is    to avoid commits to be garbage collected.  - ``acsoo tag`` now invokes ``tag_requirements``. In most cases however this    will not place additional tags on dependencies, because the normal workflow    is to invoke ``tag_requirements`` as soon as ``requirements.txt`` is updated.  - ``tag_requirements`` automatically transforms http(s) urls into ssh urls    for the purpose of pushing tags. This allows to maximize the use of http(s)    urls in requirements so CI and scripts do not require ssh access    to the public dependencies. This currently only works for the acsone organization    on github but the mechanism is easy to extend, should the need arise.1.3.0 (2017-06-04)------------------- [IMP] flake8: read additional ``flake8-options`` in acsoo configuration file.- [IMP] template: series-dependent odoo command in ``.gitlab.ci.yml``.- [IMP] template: createdb in ``.gitlab-ci.yml`` because Odoo 8 does not do it by  itself.- [ADD] addons list-depends: ``--exclude`` option1.2.2 (2017-05-30)------------------- [FIX] regression in ``tag``, ``tag_editable_requirements`` and ``release`` commands.1.2.1 (2017-05-27)------------------- [IMP] add possibility to provide main config file as option.- [IMP] checklog: read default options from ``[checklog]`` section of config file.- [IMP] pylint: read default options from ``[pylint]`` section of config file.- [IMP] pylint: the module or package to lint may be provided with ``-m``.- [IMP] flake8: read default options from ``[flake8]`` section of config file.  The only option so far is ``config`` to provide an alternate flake8  configuration file. This is useful so developer only need to type  ``acsoo flake8`` locally, even when a specific configuration is needed,  so it's trivial to run locally with the same config as in CI.1.1.0 (2017-05-25)------------------- [IMP] pylint: BREAKING the package to test must be provided explicitly,  as soon as additional pylint options are provided,  so as to enable easy local testing of a subset of a project. Examples:  ``acsoo pylint -- -d some-message odoo``, ``acsoo pylint -- odoo.addons.xyz``;- [IMP] pylint: disable more code complexity errors: ``too-many-nested-blocks``,  ``too-many-return-statements``.- [IMP] pylint: display messages causing failure last, so emails from CI.  that show the last lines of the log are more relevant.- [IMP] pylint: display summary of messages that did not cause failure, also  when there is no failure.- [ADD] ``acsoo addons list`` and ``acsoo addons list-depends``.- [ADD] ``acsoo checklog``.1.0.1 (2017-05-21)------------------- First public release.</longdescription>

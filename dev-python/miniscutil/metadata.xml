I think that some of them are implemented by existing libraries.This is supposed to be a big bag of code that I use in lots of my projects, eventually they should be replaced with an existing library or moved into their own specialized library.- `dispatch.py` hijacks the dispatcher used by `functools.singledispatch` as its own class. This is used to implement a `classdispatch` decorator that can accept a type as argument.- `adapt`, an implementation of [PEP-246](https://peps.python.org/pep-0246/#specification)- `ofdict.py` converts to and from a json-like object `JsonLike = Union[str, int, float, bool, type(None), list[JsonLike], dict[str, JsonLike]]`. It overlaps a lot with `attrs`, `cattrs` and `pydantic` libraries.- `deep.py` implements a deepcopy-like reduction system for traversing, mapping and serializing arbitrary python objects.- `deepeq.py` implements a deep-equality algorithm.- `current.py` is a base class for implementing the singleton pattern.- `sum.py` discriminated sum type.</longdescription>

Scripts can be separated via \p and \g. \p Will print everything in the standard input so far (since the last \g) and \g will submit everything in the standard input so far to jaaql (since the last \g). So \p\g will print and submit to jaaql. Any errors which we receive will be output on stdin and stderr# BuildingTo build you will need to have a python environment (3.8) setup locally. Building will produce a windows executable (the latest executable is in the repo if you require it). If you are on linux you can create an executable as well but you need to install python to do that so you might as well just use the python script. To build please run the commands below    ./build.bat# Running locallyPlease install requirements.txt. Using python 3.11</longdescription>

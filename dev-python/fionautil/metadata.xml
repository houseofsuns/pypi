	<longdescription>fionautil~~~~~~~~~Utilities for working with geodata with`Fiona &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Fiona/1.5.0&gt;`__.By default, the only prerequisite is Fiona itself.By default, the package installs without shapely. A small number offunctions, marked below, do require shapely. To use these function,install with ``pip install fionautil[functionname]`` or just separatelyinstall shapely.Contents--------drivers~~~~~~~Tools for fetching the driver name, given a file suffix-  from\_file-  From suffixfeature~~~~~~~-  field\_contains\_test (test if a feature's properties has certain   key:value pairs)-  togeojson (return a geojson-ready object)-  shapify (requires shapely)-  length (requires shapely)-  compoundgeometry~~~~~~~~-  endpoints (for polyline features)-  startpoint (for polyline features)-  endpoint (for polyline features)-  azimuth (between the start and end of a polyline)-  disjointed-  explodepoints-  explodesegments-  exploderings-  countpoints-  countsegments-  roundgeometry - round all coordinates in a geometry to a given   precisionlayer~~~~~Most of these tools mimic builtin python itertools.-  ffilter-  ffilterfalse-  fmap-  fchain-  freduce-  fslice-  fzip-  length Total length of linear features in a file's native projection   or the given Proj object-  meta (returns a layer's meta attribute)-  meta\_complete (returns the meta attribute with addional metadata,   e.g. bounds)-  bounds (returns a layer's bounds)-  find (return a feature that matches a particular key=value)measure~~~~~~~-  distance (between two coordinates)-  azimuth (between two coordinates)-  signed\_area-  clockwise (shortcut for checking if signed\_area is &gt;= 0)-  counterclockwise (shortcut for checking if signed\_area is &lt; 0)-  azimuth\_distance (returns both azimuth and distance between two   points)-  intersect (check if two planar line segments intersect)-  onsegment (check if a point lines on a line segment)-  intersectingbounds (check if two bounding boxes intersect)round~~~~~-  geometry - round all coordinates in a geometry to a specified   precision-  featurescale~~~~~Utilities for scaling a feature or geometry by a given constant. Goesfaster with Numpy installed.-  geometry-  scale\_rings-  scale - scales a list of coordinates-  feature - scale the geometry of a feature</longdescription>

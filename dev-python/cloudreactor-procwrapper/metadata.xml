CloudReactor monitors Tasks to ensure theyare still responsive, and keeps a history of the Executions of Tasks,allowing you to view failures and run durations in the past.### Auto-created TasksBefore your Task is run (including this module),the [AWS ECS CloudReactor Deployer](https://github.com/CloudReactor/aws-ecs-cloudreactor-deployer)can be used to set it up in AWS ECS,and inform CloudReactor of details of your Task.That way CloudReactor can start and schedule your Task, and setup yourTask as a service.See [CloudReactor python ECS QuickStart](https://github.com/CloudReactor/cloudreactor-python-ecs-quickstart)for an example.However, it may not be possible or desired to change your deployment process.Instead, you may configure the Task to be *auto-created*.Auto-created Tasks are created the first time your Task runs.This means there is no need to inform the API server of the Task details(during deployment) before it runs.Instead, each time the module runs, it informs the API server of theTask details at the same time as it requests the creation of a Task Execution.One disadvantage of auto-created Tasks is that they are not availablein the CloudReactor dashboard until the first time they run.When configuring a Task to be auto-created, you must specify the nameor UUID of the Run Environment in CloudReactor that the Task isassociated with. The Run Environment must be created ahead of time,either by the Cloudreactor AWS Setup Wizard,or manually in the CloudReactor dashboard.You can also specify more Task properties, such as Alert Methods andexternal links in the dashboard, by setting the environment variable`PROC_WRAPPER_AUTO_CREATE_TASK_PROPS` set to a JSON-encoded object that has the[CloudReactor Task schema](https://apidocs.cloudreactor.io/#operation/tasks_create).### Execution MethodsCloudReactor currently supports three Execution Methods:1) [AWS ECS (in Fargate)](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/)2) [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)3) UnknownIf a Task is running in AWS ECS, CloudReactor is able to run additionalTask Executions, provided the details of running the Task is providedduring deployment with the AWS ECS CloudReactor Deployer, or if theTask is configured to be auto-created, and this module is run. In thesecond case, this module uses the ECS Metadata endpoint to detectthe ECS Task settings, and sends them to the API server. CloudReactorcan also schedule Tasks or setup long-running services using Tasks,provided they are run in AWS ECS.If a Task is running in AWS Lambda, CloudReactor is able to run additionalTask Executions after the first run of the function.However, a Task may use the Unknown execution method if it is not runningin AWS ECS or Lambda. If that is the case, CloudReactor won't be able tostart the Task in the dashboard or as part of a Workflow,schedule the Task, or setup a service with the Task. But the advantage isthat the Task code can be executed by any method available to you,such as bare metal servers, VM's, or Kubernetes.All Tasks in CloudReactor, regardless of execution method, have theirhistory kept and are monitored.This module detects  the execution method your Task isrunning with and sends that information to the API server, providedyou configure your Task to be auto-created.### Passive TasksPassive Tasks are Tasks that CloudReactor does not manage. This meansscheduling and service setup must be handled by other means(cron jobs, [supervisord](http://supervisord.org/), etc).However, Tasks marked as services or that have a schedule will still bemonitored by CloudReactor, which will send notifications ifa service Task goes down or a Task does not run on schedule.The module reports to the API server that auto-created Tasks are passive,unless you specify the `--force-task-passive` commmand-line option orset the environment variable `PROC_WRAPPER_TASK_IS_PASSIVE` to `FALSE`.If a Task uses the Unknown Execution Method, it must be marked as passive,because CloudReactor does not know how to manage it.## Pre-requisitesIf you just want to use this module to retry processes, limit execution time,or fetch secrets, you can use offline mode, in which case no CloudReactor APIkey is required. But CloudReactor offers a free tier so we hope you[sign up](https://dash.cloudreactor.io/signup)for a free account to enable monitoring and/or management.If you want CloudReactor to be able to start your Tasks, you should use the[Cloudreactor AWS Setup Wizard](https://github.com/CloudReactor/cloudreactor-aws-setup-wizard)to configure your AWS environment to run Tasks in ECS Fargate.You can skip this step if running in passive mode is OK for you.If you want to use CloudReactor to manage or just monitor your Tasks,you need to create a Run Environment and an API key in the CloudReactordashboard. The API key can be scoped to the Run Environment if youwish. The key must have at least the Task access level, but foran auto-created Task, it must have at least the Developer access level.## Installation### NuitkaStandalone executables built by[nuitka](https://nuitka.net/index.html)for 64-bit Linux are available, located in `bin/nuitka`. These executables bundlepython so you don't need to have python installed on your machine. They alsobundle all optional library dependencies so you can fetch secrets from AWSSecrets Manager and extract them with jsonpath-ng, for example.Compared to executables built by PyInstaller (see below), they start up faster,and most likely are more efficient at runtime.#### RHEL or derivativesTo download and run the wrapper on a RHEL/Fedora/Amazon Linux 2 machine:    RUN wget -nv https://github.com/CloudReactor/cloudreactor-procwrapper/raw/5.0.2/bin/nuitka/al2/5.0.2/proc_wrapper.bin    ENTRYPOINT [&quot;proc_wrapper.bin&quot;]Example Dockerfiles of known working environments are available for[Amazon Linux 2](tests/integration/nuitka_executable/docker_context_al2_amd64/)and[Fedora](tests/integration/nuitka_executable/docker_context_al2_amd64/Dockerfile).Fedora 27 or later are supported.#### Debian based systemsOn a Debian based (including Ubuntu) machine:    RUN wget -nv https://github.com/CloudReactor/cloudreactor-procwrapper/raw/5.0.2/bin/nuitka/debian-amd64/5.0.2/proc_wrapper.bin    ENTRYPOINT [&quot;proc_wrapper.bin&quot;]See the example[Dockerfile](tests/integration/nuitka_executable/docker_context_debian_amd64/Dockerfile) for a known working Debian environment.Debian 10 (Buster) or later are supported.### PyInstallerStandalone executables built by [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) for 64-bit Linux and Windows are available, located in `bin/pyinstaller`.These executables bundlepython so you don't need to have python installed on your machine. They alsobundle all optional library dependencies so you can fetch secrets from AWSSecrets Manager and extract them with jsonpath-ng, for example. Compared toexecutables built by nuitka, they start up slower but might be more reliable.#### RHEL or derivativesTo download and run the wrapper on a RHEL/Fedora/Amazon Linux 2 machine:    RUN wget -nv https://github.com/CloudReactor/cloudreactor-procwrapper/raw/5.0.2/bin/pyinstaller/al2/5.0.2/proc_wrapper.bin    ENTRYPOINT [&quot;proc_wrapper.bin&quot;]Example Dockerfiles of known working environments are available for[Amazon Linux 2](tests/integration/pyinstaller_executable/docker_context_al2_amd64/)and[Fedora](tests/integration/pyinstaller_executable/docker_context_al2_amd64/Dockerfile).Fedora 27 or later are supported.#### Debian based machinesOn a Debian based (including Ubuntu) machine:    RUN wget -nv https://github.com/CloudReactor/cloudreactor-procwrapper/raw/5.0.2/bin/pyinstaller/debian-amd64/5.0.2/proc_wrapper.bin    ENTRYPOINT [&quot;proc_wrapper.bin&quot;]See the example[Dockerfile](tests/integration/pyinstaller_executable/docker_context_debian_amd64/Dockerfile) for a known working Debian environment.Debian 10 (Buster) or later are supported.Special thanks to[wine](https://www.winehq.org/) and[PyInstaller Docker Images](https://github.com/cdrx/docker-pyinstaller)for making it possible to cross-compile!### When python is availableInstall this module via pip (or your favorite package manager):`pip install cloudreactor-procwrapper`Fetching secrets from AWS Secrets Manager requires that[boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) is available to import in your python environment.JSON Path transformation requires that [jsonpath-ng](https://github.com/h2non/jsonpath-ng)be available to import in your python environment.You can get the tested versions of both dependencies in[proc_wrapper-requirements.in](https://github.com/CloudReactor/cloudreactor-procwrapper/blob/main/proc_wrapper-requirements.in)(suitable for use by [pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools/)) or the resolved requirements in[proc_wrapper-requirements.txt](https://github.com/CloudReactor/cloudreactor-procwrapper/blob/main/proc_wrapper-requirements.txt).## UsageThere are two ways of using the module: wrapped mode and embedded mode.### Wrapped modeIn wrapped mode, you pass a command line to the module which itexecutes in a child process. The command can be implemented in whateverprogramming language the running machine supports.Instead of running    somecommand --somearg xyou would run    ./proc_wrapper somecommand --somearg xassuming that are using the PyInstaller standalone executable, and thatyou configure the program using environment variables.Or, if you have python installed:    python -m proc_wrapper somecommand --somearg xHere are all the options:    usage: proc_wrapper [-h] [-v] [-n TASK_NAME] [--task-uuid TASK_UUID] [-a]                        [--auto-create-task-run-environment-name AUTO_CREATE_TASK_RUN_ENVIRONMENT_NAME]                        [--auto-create-task-run-environment-uuid AUTO_CREATE_TASK_RUN_ENVIRONMENT_UUID]                        [--auto-create-task-props AUTO_CREATE_TASK_PROPS]                        [--force-task-active]                        [--task-execution-uuid TASK_EXECUTION_UUID]                        [--task-version-number TASK_VERSION_NUMBER]                        [--task-version-text TASK_VERSION_TEXT]                        [--task-version-signature TASK_VERSION_SIGNATURE]                        [--execution-method-props EXECUTION_METHOD_PROPS]                        [--task-instance-metadata TASK_INSTANCE_METADATA] [-s]                        [--schedule SCHEDULE] [--max-concurrency MAX_CONCURRENCY]                        [--max-conflicting-age MAX_CONFLICTING_AGE]                        [--api-base-url API_BASE_URL] [-k API_KEY]                        [--api-heartbeat-interval API_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL]                        [--api-error-timeout API_ERROR_TIMEOUT]                        [--api-final-update-timeout API_FINAL_UPDATE_TIMEOUT]                        [--api-retry-delay API_RETRY_DELAY]                        [--api-resume-delay API_RESUME_DELAY]                        [--api-task-execution-creation-error-timeout API_TASK_EXECUTION_CREATION_ERROR_TIMEOUT]                        [--api-task-execution-creation-conflict-timeout API_TASK_EXECUTION_CREATION_CONFLICT_TIMEOUT]                        [--api-task-execution-creation-conflict-retry-delay API_TASK_EXECUTION_CREATION_CONFLICT_RETRY_DELAY]                        [--api-request-timeout API_REQUEST_TIMEOUT] [-o] [-p]                        [-d DEPLOYMENT] [--send-pid] [--send-hostname]                        [--no-send-runtime-metadata]                        [-l {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL}] [--log-secrets]                        [--exclude-timestamps-in-log] [-w WORK_DIR]                        [-c COMMAND_LINE] [--shell-mode {auto,enable,disable}]                        [--no-strip-shell-wrapping]                        [--no-process-group-termination] [-t PROCESS_TIMEOUT]                        [-r PROCESS_MAX_RETRIES]                        [--process-retry-delay PROCESS_RETRY_DELAY]                        [--process-check-interval PROCESS_CHECK_INTERVAL]                        [--process-termination-grace-period PROCESS_TERMINATION_GRACE_PERIOD]                        [--enable-status-update-listener]                        [--status-update-socket-port STATUS_UPDATE_SOCKET_PORT]                        [--status-update-message-max-bytes STATUS_UPDATE_MESSAGE_MAX_BYTES]                        [--status-update-interval STATUS_UPDATE_INTERVAL]                        [-e ENV_LOCATIONS] [--config CONFIG_LOCATIONS]                        [--config-merge-strategy {DEEP,SHALLOW,REPLACE,ADDITIVE,TYPESAFE_REPLACE,TYPESAFE_ADDITIVE}]                        [--overwrite_env_during_resolution]                        [--config-ttl CONFIG_TTL]                        [--no-fail-fast-config-resolution]                        [--resolved-env-var-name-prefix RESOLVED_ENV_VAR_NAME_PREFIX]                        [--resolved-env-var-name-suffix RESOLVED_ENV_VAR_NAME_SUFFIX]                        [--resolved-config-property-name-prefix RESOLVED_CONFIG_PROPERTY_NAME_PREFIX]                        [--resolved-config-property-name-suffix RESOLVED_CONFIG_PROPERTY_NAME_SUFFIX]                        [--env-var-name-for-config ENV_VAR_NAME_FOR_CONFIG]                        [--config-property-name-for-env CONFIG_PROPERTY_NAME_FOR_ENV]                        [--rollbar-access-token ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN]                        [--rollbar-retries ROLLBAR_RETRIES]                        [--rollbar-retry-delay ROLLBAR_RETRY_DELAY]                        [--rollbar-timeout ROLLBAR_TIMEOUT]                        ...

Executing in a shell allows shell scripts,                            commands, and expressions to be used, with the                            disadvantage that termination signals may not be                            propagated to child processes. Options are: enable --                            Force the command to be executed in a shell; disable                            -- Force the command to be executed without a shell;                            auto -- Auto-detect the shell mode by analyzing the                            command.      --no-strip-shell-wrapping                            Do not strip the command-line of shell wrapping like                            &quot;/bin/sh -c&quot; that can be introduced by Docker when                            using shell form of ENTRYPOINT and CMD.      --no-process-group-termination                            Send termination and kill signals to the wrapped                            process only, instead of its process group (which is                            the default). Sending to the process group allows all                            child processes to receive the signals, even if the                            wrapped process does not forward signals. However, if                            your wrapped process manually handles and forwards                            signals to its child processes, you probably want to                            send signals to only your wrapped process.      -t PROCESS_TIMEOUT, --process-timeout PROCESS_TIMEOUT                            Timeout for process completion, in seconds. -1 means                            no timeout, which is the default.      -r PROCESS_MAX_RETRIES, --process-max-retries PROCESS_MAX_RETRIES                            Maximum number of times to retry failed processes. -1                            means to retry forever. Defaults to 0.      --process-retry-delay PROCESS_RETRY_DELAY                            Number of seconds to wait before retrying a process.                            Defaults to 60.      --process-check-interval PROCESS_CHECK_INTERVAL                            Number of seconds to wait between checking the status                            of processes. Defaults to 10.      --process-termination-grace-period PROCESS_TERMINATION_GRACE_PERIOD                            Number of seconds to wait after sending SIGTERM to a                            process, but before killing it with SIGKILL.

If not specified,                            status update messages will not be read.      --status-update-socket-port STATUS_UPDATE_SOCKET_PORT                            The port used to receive status updates from the                            process. Defaults to 2373.      --status-update-message-max-bytes STATUS_UPDATE_MESSAGE_MAX_BYTES                            The maximum number of bytes status update messages can                            be. Defaults to 65536.      --status-update-interval STATUS_UPDATE_INTERVAL                            Minimum of number of seconds to wait between sending                            status updates to the API server. -1 means to not send                            status updates except with heartbeats. Defaults to -1.    configuration:      Environment/configuration resolution settings      -e ENV_LOCATIONS, --env ENV_LOCATIONS                            Location of either local file, AWS S3 ARN, or AWS                            Secrets Manager ARN containing properties used to                            populate the environment for embedded mode, or the                            process environment for wrapped mode. By default, the                            file format is assumed to be dotenv. Specify multiple                            times to include multiple locations.      --config CONFIG_LOCATIONS                            Location of either local file, AWS S3 ARN, or AWS                            Secrets Manager ARN containing properties used to                            populate the configuration for embedded mode. By                            default, the file format is assumed to be in JSON.

It requires multi-process support, as the moduleruns at the same time as the command it wraps.### Embedded modeYou can use embedded mode to execute python code from inside a python program.Include the `proc_wrapper` package in your python project'sdependencies. To run a task you want to be monitored:    from typing import Any, Mapping    from proc_wrapper import ProcWrapper, ProcWrapperParams    def fun(wrapper: ProcWrapper, cbdata: dict[str, int],            config: Mapping[str, Any]) -&gt; int:        print(cbdata)        return cbdata['a']    # This is the function signature of a function invoked by AWS Lambda.    def entrypoint(event: Any, context: Any) -&gt; int:        params = ProcWrapperParams()        params.auto_create_task = True        # If the Task Execution is running in AWS Lambda, CloudReactor can make        # the associated Task available to run (non-passive) in the CloudReactor        # dashboard or by API, after the wrapper reports its first execution.        proc_wrapper_params.task_is_passive = False        params.task_name = 'embedded_test_production'        params.auto_create_task_run_environment_name = 'production'        # For example only, in the real world you would use Secret Fetching;        # see below.        params.api_key = 'YOUR_CLOUDREACTOR_API_KEY'        # In an AWS Lambda environment, passing the context and event allows        # CloudReactor to monitor and manage this Task.        proc_wrapper = ProcWrapper(params=params, runtime_context=context,            input_value=event)        x = proc_wrapper.managed_call(fun, {'a': 1, 'b': 2})        # Should print 1        print(x)        return xThis is suitable for running in single-threaded environments likeAWS Lambda, or as part of a larger process that executessub-routines that should be monitored. See[cloudreactor-python-lambda-quickstart](https://github.com/CloudReactor/cloudreactor-python-lambda-quickstart) for an example project that usesproc_wrapper in a function run by AWS Lambda.#### Embedded mode configurationIn embedded mode, besides setting properties of `ProcWrapperParams` in code,`ProcWrapper` can be also configured in two ways:First, using environment variables, as in wrapped mode.Second, using the configuration dictionary. If the configuration dictionarycontains the key `proc_wrapper_params` and its value is a dictionary, thekeys and values in the dictionary will be used to to set these attributes in`ProcWrapperParams`:| Key                              | Type      | Mutable | Uses Resolved Config ||----------------------------------|-----------|---------|----------------------|| log_secrets                      | bool      | No      | No                   || env_locations                    | list[str] | No      | No                   || config_locations                 | list[str] | No      | No                   || config_merge_strategy            | str       | No      | No                   || overwrite_env_during_resolution  | bool      | No      | No                   || max_config_resolution_depth      | int       | No      | No                   || max_config_resolution_iterations | int       | No      | No                   || config_ttl                       | int       | No      | No                   || fail_fast_config_resolution      | bool      | No      | No                   || resolved_env_var_name_prefix     | str       | No      | No                   || resolved_env_var_name_suffix     | str       | No      | No                   || resolved_config_property_name_prefix | str     | No      | No                   || resolved_config_property_name_suffix | str    | No      | No                   || schedule                          | str       | No      | Yes                  || max_concurrency                   | int       | No      | Yes                  || max_conflicting_age               | int       | No      | Yes                  || offline_mode                      | bool       | No      | Yes                  || prevent_offline_execution         | bool       | No      | Yes                  || service                           | bool       | No      | Yes                  || deployment                        | str       | No      | Yes                  || api_base_url                      | str       | No      | Yes                  || api_heartbeat_interval            | int       | No      | Yes                  || enable_status_listener            | bool      | No      | Yes                  || status_update_socket_port         | int        | No      | Yes                  || status_update_message_max_bytes   | int        | No      | Yes                  || status_update_interval            | int        | No      | Yes                  || log_level                         | str        | No      | Yes                  || include_timestamps_in_log         | bool      | No      | Yes                  || api_key                           | str        | Yes     | Yes                  || api_request_timeout               | int        | Yes      | Yes                  || api_error_timeout                 | int        | Yes     | Yes                  || api_retry_delay                   | int        | Yes     | Yes                  || api_resume_delay                  | int        | Yes     | Yes                  || api_task_execution_creation_error_timeout | int        | Yes     | Yes                  || api_task_execution_creation_conflict_timeout | int        | Yes     | Yes                  || api_task_execution_creation_conflict_retry_delay | int        | Yes     | Yes                  || process_timeout                   | int        | Yes     | Yes                  || process_max_retries               | int        | Yes     | Yes                  || process_retry_delay               | int        | Yes     | Yes                  || command                           | list[str]  | Yes     | Yes                  || command_line                      | str        | Yes     | Yes                  || shell_mode                        | bool      | Yes     | Yes                  || strip_shell_wrapping              | bool      | Yes     | Yes                  || work_dir                          | str       | Yes     | Yes                  || process_termination_grace_period  | int       | Yes     | Yes                  || send_pid                          | bool      | Yes     | Yes                  || send_hostname                     | bool      | Yes     | Yes                  || send_runtime_metadata             | bool      | Yes     | Yes                  |Keys that are marked with &quot;Mutable&quot; -- &quot;No&quot; in the table above can beoverridden when the configuration is reloaded after the `config_ttl` expires.Keys that are marked as &quot;Uses Resolved Config&quot; -- &quot;Yes&quot; in the table above cancome from the resolved configuration after secret resolution (see below).## Secret Fetching and ResolutionA common requirement is that deployed code / images do not contain secretsinternally which could be decompiled. Instead, programs should fetch secretsfrom an external source in a secure manner. If your program runs in AWS, itcan make use of AWS's roles that have permission to access data inSecrets Manager or S3. However, in many scenarios, having your program accessAWS directly has the following disadvantages:1) Your program becomes coupled to AWS, so it is difficult to run locally orswitch to another infrastructure provider2) You need to write code or use a library for each programming language youuse, so secret fetching is done in a non-uniform way3) Writing code to merge and parse secrets from different sources is tediousTherefore, proc_wrapper implements Secret Fetching and Resolution to solvethese problems so your programs don't have to. Both usage modes can fetch secrets from[AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/),AWS S3, or the local filesystem, and optionally extract embedded datainto the environment or a configuration dictionary. The environment is used topass values to processes run in wrapped mode,while the configuration dictionary is passed to the callback function inembedded mode.proc_wrapper parses secret location strings that specify the how to resolvea secret value. Each secret location string has the format:`[PROVIDER_CODE:]&lt;Provider specific address&gt;[!FORMAT][|JP:&lt;JSON Path expression&gt;]`### Secret ProvidersProviders indicate the raw source of the secret data. The table below lists thesupported providers:| Provider Code | Value Prefix              | Provider                     | Example Address                                             | Required libs                                                               | Notes                                                         ||---------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|| `AWS_SM`      | `arn:aws:secretsmanager:` | AWS Secrets Manager          | `arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-2:1234567890:secret:config` | [boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) | Can also include version suffix like `-PPrpY`                 || `AWS_S3`      | `arn:aws:s3:::`           | AWS S3 Object                | `arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket/staging/app1/config.json`       | [boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) |                                                               || `FILE`        | `file://`                 | Local file                   | `file:///home/appuser/app/.env`                                    |                                                                             | The default provider if no provider is auto-detected          || `ENV`         |                           | The process environment      | `SOME_TOKEN`                                                |                                                                             | The name of another environment variable                      || `CONFIG`      |                           | The configuration dictionary | `$.db`                                                      | [jsonpath-ng](https://github.com/h2non/jsonpath-ng)                         | JSON path expression to extract the data in the configuration || `PLAIN`       |                           | Plaintext                    | `{&quot;user&quot;: &quot;postgres&quot;, &quot;password&quot;: &quot;badpassword&quot;}`           |                                                                             |                                                               |If you don't specify an explicit provider prefix in a secret location(e.g. `AWS_SM:`), the provider can be auto-detected from the address portionusing the Value Prefix.

Otherwise, you may need to an explicit format code(e.g. `!yaml`).#### AWS Secrets Manager / S3 notes[boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html)is used to fetch secrets. It will try to access to AWS Secrets Manageror S3 using environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` if they are set, or use the EC2 instance role, ECS taskrole, or Lambda execution role if available.For Secrets Manager, you can also use &quot;partial ARNs&quot;(without the hyphened suffix) as keys.In the example above    arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-2:1234567890:secret:configcould be used to fetch the same secret, provided there are no conflicting secret ARNs.This allows you to get the latest version of the secret.If the secret was stored in Secrets Manager as binary, thecorresponding value will be set to the Base-64 encoded value.If you're deploying a python function using AWS Lambda, note that boto3 isalready included in the available packages, so there's no need to include it(unless the bundled version isn't compatible). Also we strongly encourage youto add:    logging.getLogger(&quot;botocore&quot;).setLevel(logging.INFO)to your code if you are using proc_wrapper for secrets resolution. Thisprevent secrets from Secrets Manager from being leaked. For details, see this[issue](https://github.com/boto/boto3/issues/2292).### Secret TranformationFetching secrets can be relatively expensive and it makes sense to group relatedsecrets together. Therefore it is common to store dictionaries (formattedas JSON or YAML) as secrets. However, each desired environment variableor configuration property may only consist of a fragment of the dictionary.For example, given the JSON-formatted dictionary    {      &quot;username&quot;: &quot;postgres&quot;,      &quot;password&quot;: &quot;badpassword&quot;    }you may want to populate the environment variable `DB_USERNAME` with`postgres`.To facilitate this, dictionary fragments can be extracted to individualenvironment variables using [jsonpath-ng](https://github.com/h2non/jsonpath-ng).To specify that a variable be extracted from a dictionary usinga JSON Path expression, append `|JP:` followed by the JSON Path expressionto the secret location string. For example, if the AWS Secrets ManagerARN    arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-2:1234567890:secret:db-PPrpYcontains the dictionary above, then the secret location string    arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-2:1234567890:secret:db-PPrpY|JP:$.usernamewill resolve to `postgres` as desired.If you do something similar to get the password from the same JSON value,proc_wrapper is smart enough to cache the fetched dictionary, so that theraw data is only fetched once.Since JSON path expressions yield a list of results, the secrets fetcherimplements the following rules to transform the list to the final value:1. If the list of results has a single value, that value is used as thefinal value, unless `[*]` is appended to the JSON path expression.2. Otherwise, the final value is the list of results#### Fetching from another environment variableIn some deployment scenarios, multiple secrets can be injected into asingle environment variable as a JSON encoded object. In that case,the module can extract secrets using the *ENV* secret source. For example,you may have arranged to have the environment variable DB_CONFIG injectedwith the JSON encoded value:    { &quot;username&quot;: &quot;postgres&quot;, &quot;password&quot;: &quot;nohackme&quot; }Then to extract the username to the environment variable DB_USERNAME youyou would add the environment variable DB_USER_FOR_PROC_WRAPPER_TO_RESOLVEset to    ENV:DB_CONFIG|JP:$.username### Secret injection into environment and configurationNow let's use secret location strings toinject the values into the environment (for wrapped mode)and/or the the configuration dictionary (for embedded mode). proc_wrappersupports two methods of secret injection which can be combined together:* Top-level fetching* Secrets Resolution### Top-level fetchingTop-level fetching refers to fetching a dictionary that contains multiple secretsand populating the environment / configuration dictionary with it.To use top-level fetching, you specify the secret locationsfrom which you want to fetch the secrets and the corresponding values aremerged together into the environment / configuration.To use top-level fetching in wrapped mode, populate theenvironment variables `PROC_WRAPPER_ENV_LOCATIONS` with a comma-separatedlist of secret locations, or use the command-line option`--env-locations &lt;secret_location&gt;` one or more times. Secret locationstrings passed in via `PROC_WRAPPER_ENV_LOCATIONS` or `--env-locations`will be parsed as `dotenv` files unless format is auto-detected orexplicitly specified.To use top-level fetching in embedded mode, set the `ProcWrapperParams` property`config_locations` to a list of secret locations. Alternatively, you can setthe environment variable `PROC_WRAPPER_CONFIG_LOCATIONS` to a comma-separatedlist, and this will be picked up automatically. Secret location valueswill be parsed as JSON unless the format is auto-detected or explicitlyspecified. The `config` argumentpassed to the your callback function will contain a merged dictionary of allfetched and parsed dictionary values. For example:    def callback(wrapper: ProcWrapper, cbdata: str,            config: Dict[str, Any]) -&gt; str:        return &quot;super&quot; + cbdata + config[&quot;username&quot;]    def main():        params = ProcWrapperParams()        # Optional: you can set an initial configuration dictionary which will        # have its values included in the final configuration unless overridden.        params.initial_config = {            &quot;log_level&quot;: &quot;DEBUG&quot;        }        # You can omit this if you set PROC_WRAPPER_CONFIG_LOCATIONS environment        # variable to the same ARN        params.config_locations = [            &quot;arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-2:1234567890:secret:db-PPrpY&quot;,            # More secret locations can be added here, and their values will            # be merged        ]        wrapper = ProcWrapper(params=params)        # Returns &quot;superduperpostgres&quot;        return wrapper.managed_call(callback, &quot;duper&quot;)#### Merging SecretsTop-level fetching can potentially fetch multiple dictionaries which aremerged together in the final environment / configuration dictionary.The default merge strategy (`DEEP`) merges recursively, even dictionariesin lists. The `SHALLOW` merge strategy just overwrites top-level keys, with latersecret locations taking precedence. However, if you include the[mergedeep](https://github.com/clarketm/mergedeep) library, you can alsoset the merge strategy to one of:* `REPLACE`* `ADDITIVE`* `TYPESAFE_REPLACE`* `TYPESAFE_ADDITIVE`so that nested lists can be appended to instead of replaced (in the case of the`ADDITIVE` strategies), or errors will be raised if incompatibly-typed valuesare merged (in the case of the `TYPESAFE` strategies). In wrapped mode,the merge strategy can be set with the `--config-merge-strategy` command-lineargument or `PROC_WRAPPER_CONFIG_MERGE_STRATEGY` environment variable. Inembedded mode, the merge strategy can be set in the`config_merge_strategy` string property of `ProcWrapperParams`.### Secret ResolutionSecret Resolution substitutes configuration or environment values that aresecret location strings with the computed values of those strings. Comparedto Secret Fetching, Secret Resolution is more useful when you want morecontrol over the names of variables or when you have secret values deepinside your configuration.In wrapped mode, if you want to set the environment variable `MY_SECRET` witha value fetchedfrom AWS Secrets Manager, you would set the environment variable`MY_SECRET_FOR_PROC_WRAPPER_TO_RESOLVE` to a secret location stringwhich is ARN of the secret, for example:    arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-2:1234567890:secret:db-PPrpY(The `_FOR_PROC_WRAPPER_TO_RESOLVE` suffix of environment variable names isremoved during resolution. It can also be configured with the `PROC_WRAPPER_RESOLVABLE_ENV_VAR_NAME_SUFFIX` environment variable.)In embedded mode, if you want the final configuration dictionary to look like:    {      &quot;db_username&quot;: &quot;postgres&quot;,      &quot;db_password&quot;: &quot;badpassword&quot;,      ...    }The initial configuration dictionary would look like:    {      &quot;db_username__to_resolve&quot;: &quot;arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-2:1234567890:secret:db-PPrpY|JP:$.username&quot;,      &quot;db_password__to_resolve&quot;: &quot;arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-2:1234567890:secret:db-PPrpY|JP:$.password&quot;,      ...    }(The `__to_resolve` suffix (with 2 underscores!) of keys is removed duringresolution. It can also be configured with the `resolved_config_property_name_suffix`property of `ProcWrapperParams`.)proc_wrapper can also resolve keys in embedded dictionaries, like:    {      &quot;db&quot;: {        &quot;username__to_resolve&quot;: &quot;arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-2:1234567890:secret:config-PPrpY|JP:$.username&quot;,        &quot;password__to_resolve&quot;:        &quot;arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-2:1234567890:secret:config-PPrpY|JP:$.password&quot;,        ...      },      ...    }up to a maximum depth that you can control with `ProcWrapperParams.max_config_resolution_depth` (which defaults to 5). That would resolve to    {      &quot;db&quot;: {        &quot;username&quot;: &quot;postgres&quot;,        &quot;password&quot;: &quot;badpassword&quot;        ...      },      ...    }You can also inject entire dictionaries, like:    {      &quot;db__to_resolve&quot;: &quot;arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-2:1234567890:secret:config-PPrpY&quot;,      ...    }which would resolve to    {      &quot;db&quot;: {        &quot;username&quot;: &quot;postgres&quot;,        &quot;password&quot;: &quot;badpassword&quot;      },      ...    }To enable secret resolution in wrapped mode, set environment variable `PROC_WRAPPER_RESOLVE_SECRETS` to `TRUE`. In embedded mode, secretresolution is enabled by default; set the`max_config_resolution_iterations` property of `ProcWrapperParams` to `0`to disable resolution.Secret resolution is run multiple times so that if a resolved value containsa secret location string, it will be resolved on the next pass. By default,proc_wrapper limits the maximum number of resolution passes to 3 but youcan control this with the environment variable`PROC_WRAPPER_MAX_CONFIG_RESOLUTION_ITERATIONS` in embedded mode,or by setting the `max_config_resolution_iterations` property of`ProcWrapperParams` in wrapped mode.### Environment ProjectionDuring secret fetching and secret resolution, proc_wrapper internally maintainsthe computed environment as a dictionary which may have embedded lists anddictionaries. However, the final environment passed to the process is a flatdictionary containing only string values. So proc_wrapper convertsall top-level values to strings using these rules:* Lists and dictionaries are converted to their JSON-encoded string value* Boolean values are converted to their upper-cased string representation(e.g. the string `FALSE` for the boolean value `false`)* The `None` value is converted to the empty string* All other values are converted using python's `str()` function### Secrets RefreshingYou can set a Time to Live (TTL) on the duration that secret values are cached.Caching helps reduce expensive lookups of secrets and bandwidth usage.In wrapped mode, set the TTL of environment variables set from secret locationsusing the `--config-ttl` command-line argument or`PROC_WRAPPER_CONFIG_TTL_SECONDS` environment variable.If the process exits, you have configured the script to retry,and the TTL has expired since the last fetch,proc_wrapper will re-fetch the secretsand resolve them again, for the environment passed to the next invocation ofyour process.In embedded mode, set the TTL of configuration dictionary values set fromsecret locations by setting the `config_ttl` property of`ProcWrapperParams`. If 1) your callback function raises an exception, 2) you haveconfigured the script to retry; and 3) the TTL has expired since the last fetch,proc_wrapper will re-fetch the secretsand resolve them again, for the configuration passed to the next invocation ofthe callback function.## Status Updates### Status Updates in Wrapped ModeWhile your process in running, you can send status updates toCloudReactor by using the StatusUpdater class. Status updates are shown inthe CloudReactor dashboard and allow you to track the current progress of aTask and also how many items are being processed in multiple executionsover time.In wrapped mode, your application code would send updates to theproc_wrapper program via UDP port 2373 (configurable with the PROC_WRAPPER_STATUS_UPDATE_PORT environment variable).If your application code is in python, you can use the providedStatusUpdater class to do this:    from proc_wrapper import StatusUpdater    with StatusUpdater() as updater:        updater.send_update(last_status_message=&quot;Starting ...&quot;)        success_count = 0        for i in range(100):            try:                do_work()                success_count += 1                updater.send_update(success_count=success_count)            except Exception:                failed_count += 1                updater.send_update(failed_count=failed_count)        updater.send_update(last_status_message=&quot;Finished!&quot;)### Status Updates in Embedded ModeIn embedded mode, your callback in python code can use the wrapper instance tosend updates:    from typing import Any, Mapping    import proc_wrapper    from proc_wrapper import ProcWrapper    def fun(wrapper: ProcWrapper, cbdata: dict[str, int],            config: Mapping[str, Any]) -&gt; int:        wrapper.update_status(last_status_message=&quot;Starting the fun ...&quot;)        success_count = 0        error_count = 0        for i in range(100):            try:                do_work()                success_count += 1            except Exception:                error_count += 1            wrapper.update_status(success_count=success_count,                    error_count=error_count)        wrapper.update_status(last_status_message=&quot;The fun is over.&quot;)        return cbdata[&quot;a&quot;]    params = ProcWrapperParams()    params.auto_create_task = True    params.auto_create_task_run_environment_name = &quot;production&quot;    params.task_name = &quot;embedded_test&quot;    params.api_key = &quot;YOUR_CLOUDREACTOR_API_KEY&quot;    proc_wrapper = ProcWrapper(params=params)    proc_wrapper.managed_call(fun, {&quot;a&quot;: 1, &quot;b&quot;: 2})## Example ProjectsThese projects contain sample Tasks that use this library to report theirexecution status and results to CloudReactor* [cloudreactor-python-ecs-quickstart](https://github.com/CloudReactor/cloudreactor-python-ecs-quickstart) runs python code in a Docker containerin AWS ECS Fargate (wrapped mode)* [cloudreactor-python-lambda-quickstart](https://github.com/CloudReactor/cloudreactor-python-lambda-quickstart) runs python code in AWS Lambda(embedded mode)* [cloudreactor-java-ecs-quickstart](https://github.com/CloudReactor/cloudreactor-java-ecs-quickstart) runs Java code in a Docker container inAWS ECS Fargate (wrapped mode)## LicenseThis software is dual-licensed under open source (MPL 2.0) and commerciallicenses.

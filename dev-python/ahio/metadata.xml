	<longdescription>ahio====ahio is a communication library whose goalis to abstract the interfacing with various I/O hardwares, so that changinghardware becomes possible with minimum code modification. It's desired thatan application that already works with an I/O hardware will only need pinremapping and possibly initial setup change to work with another hardware, notentire code rewrite.It works with drivers, which are installed in the `ahio.drivers` package. Everydriver must implement the API described in the `ahio.abstract_driver` package.If you plan to use this library or develop a driver, read the documentationthere.Installation------------Simplest way is to use pip: `pip3 install ahio`Alternatively you can checkout this repository and run`python3 setup.py install`Basic usage-----------```python# Import the package:import ahio# You can see what drivers are available in this platform by callingprint(ahio.list_available_drivers())# Instantiate the desired driverwith ahio.new_driver('Arduino') as arduino:  # The driver can have a driver-specific setup function. Call it as/if needed.  arduino.setup('/dev/tty.usbmodem1421')  # Map the pins. From now on, when you use 1 in the API, it will have effects  # on pin D3 in the Arduino. If you change hardware in the future, just change  # the mapping.  arduino.map_pin(1, arduino.Pins.D3)  arduino.map_pin(2, arduino.Pins.D13)  arduino.map_pin(3, arduino.Pins.A1)  # Change a pin direction (Input or Output)  arduino.set_pin_direction([1, 2], ahio.Direction.Output)  arduino.set_pin_direction(3, ahio.Direction.Input)  # Set the output of a pin  arduino.write([1, 2], ahio.LogicValue.High)  arduino.write(1, 0.4, pwm=True)  # Read the input of a pin  print(arduino.read(3))```Documentation-------------Documentation is hosted at [GitHub](https://acristoffers.github.io/ahio)</longdescription>

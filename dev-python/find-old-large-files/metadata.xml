Instead, it moves them to a designated &quot;trash&quot; directory, allowing you to restore them if necessary.- **Exclusion List:** You can list file extensions to exclude from the scan. This feature ensures important file types aren't moved to the trash.- **Free &amp; Open Source:** Unlike CleanMyMac X, Find Old Large Files is completely free to use and open-source, promoting transparency and community involvement.## InstallationInstall Find Old Large Files with ease using pip:```bashpip install find_old_large_files```## UsageFind Old Large Files is designed with user convenience in mind and can be used via the command line in two primary ways:### Default UseBy default, Find Old Large Files is configured to scan your home directory. It searches for files that are larger than 100MB and older than 365 days, moving matching files to a designated 'trash' directory within your home directory. To use the utility with these default parameters, use the following command:```bashfind_old_large_files```### Custom UseIf you wish to customize the utility to meet specific requirements, you can modify the parameters as follows:```bashpython find_old_large_files.py --size 200 --days 180 --dir /Users/username/Documents --exclude .pdf .docx --trash /Users/username/trash```Detailed explanation of the parameters:--size: Sets the file size limit in MB. Files larger than this limit will be moved to the trash. This allows you to manage files based on their sizes. Default value is 100MB.--days: Specifies the file age limit in days. Files older than this limit will be moved to the trash. This is useful for managing files based on their last modified date. Default value is 365 days.--dir: Defines the directory to scan for large, old files. This gives you control over the directories to be scanned. Default directory is the home directory.--exclude: Allows you to provide a list of file extensions to exclude from the scan. This is crucial to prevent important file types from being moved to the trash. Default excluded extensions are '.docx' and '.xlsx'.--trash: Determines the directory where the large, old files will be moved. This lets you manage your file deletions more effectively. Default directory is a 'trash' directory within the home directory.### ExamplesHere are some common usage scenarios:1. To scan a specific directory for large, old files:```bashpython find_old_large_files.py --dir /path/to/directory```2. To exclude certain file types from being moved to the trash:```bashpython find_old_large_files.py --exclude .pdf .docx```3. To change the destination directory for files moved to trash:```bashpython find_old_large_files.py --trash /path/to/trash```### TroubleshootingIn case of any errors or issues, please refer to the log file file_scanner.log in your trash directory for details. If the problem persists, feel free to open an issue on the GitHub repository.Find Old Large Files is engineered to ensure user safety. It won't delete any files without your confirmation, and it lets you review the files marked for deletion before moving them to the trash. However, as with any utility that modifies your file system, we recommend using it with caution. Always ensure your crucial files are backed up before using Find Old Large Files.## ContributingWe warmly welcome and appreciate contributions from the community!

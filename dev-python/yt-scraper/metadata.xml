	<longdescription># YouTube Scraper&gt; A simple command utility to extract information from the YouTube API v3 for scientific purposes.[![made-with-python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Python-1f425f.svg)](https://www.python.org/)[![License: Unlicense](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Unlicense-blue.svg)](http://unlicense.org/)[![version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/yt-scraper)](https://pypi.org/project/yt-scraper/)![](data/header.png)## AboutThis Python based command line utility enables the easy extraction of information from the YouTube API (Version 3). Currently, it supports only a small subset of the API interface and focuses on extracting related videos from given starting points.## InstallationFirst, make sure you have a recent version of [Python 3][python-url] installed.Next, install **yt-scraper** by using [pip][pip-url]:```shsudo pip install yt-scraper```**Update** by adding the `--upgrade` flag:```shsudo pip install --upgrade yt-scraper```**Windows** users may need to alter the command to:```shpy -m pip install --upgrade yt-scraper```**Mac** users may need to alter the command to:```shpython3 -m pip install --upgrade yt-scraper```### API KeyIn order to use this program, you will need an official YouTube API key. You can obtain one from [this][yt-console-url] page and use it with the following examples by appending `-k &lt;KEY&gt;` to them.## UsageCurrently, **yt-scraper** has two commands: *search* and *config*The first command is used to query the YouTube API, whereas the second is used toconfigure the default configuration.The search command starts a video search from one or multiple given starting points. These could be multiple videos orginating from a search (using *term*),or a provided list of video ids (using *input*), or just one root video (using *id* or *url*).For example, the following command will return the first video when one searches for `cat`.```sh$ yt-scraper search term 'cat'``````[STATUS] Result: Depth: 0, Rank: 0, ID: hY7m5jjJ9mM            Title: CATS will make you LAUGH YOUR HEAD OFF - Funny CAT compilation            Related Videos: []```One can also provide a video id or a video url as a starting point, which is more interesting when combined with the `--max-depth` option:```sh$ yt-scraper search id '0A2R27kCeD4' --max-depth 2`````` Depth: 0, Rank: 0, ID: 0A2R27kCeD4            Title: 🤣 Funniest 🐶 Dogs and 😻 Cats - Awesome Funny Home Animal Videos 😇            Related Videos: ['pc8-8KfIW5c']     Depth: 1, Rank: 0, ID: pc8-8KfIW5c                Title: 🦁 Funniest Animals 🐼 - Try Not To Laugh 🤣 - Funny Domestic And Wild Animals' Life                Related Videos: ['OrJMUNEyZsE']         Depth: 2, Rank: 0, ID: OrJMUNEyZsE                    Title: Funniest Videos for Pets to Watch Compilation | Funny Pet Videos                    Related Videos: []```Additionally, one can specify the number of videos that should be returned on each level by utilizing the `--number` option.For instance, the following command returns two related videos from a given video (specified by it's url) and additionally one related video from each sibling:```sh$ yt-scraper search url 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A2R27kCeD4' --depth 1 --number 2 --number 1`````` [STATUS] Result:  Depth: 0, Rank: 0, ID: 0A2R27kCeD4             Title: 🤣 Funniest 🐶 Dogs and 😻 Cats - Awesome Funny Home Animal Videos 😇             Related Videos: ['pc8-8KfIW5c', 'tbyAuT50eu4']      Depth: 1, Rank: 0, ID: pc8-8KfIW5c                 Title: 🦁 Funniest Animals 🐼 - Try Not To Laugh 🤣 - Funny Domestic And Wild Animals' Life                 Related Videos: []      Depth: 1, Rank: 1, ID: tbyAuT50eu4                 Title: 😁 Funniest 😻 Cats and 🐶 Dogs - Awesome Funny Pet Animals 😇                 Related Videos: []```For the sake of brevity, you can shorten `--number` to `-n` and `--depth` to`-d`. There are even global commands, too! Global options are specified in front of the command and alter the behavior of all commands. This may not sound very meaningful to you given that there only two commands right now and you are right!But this is likely to change in the future.For example, to see more output during the program execution, specify `--verbose` or `-v` right after `yt-scraper`:```sh$ yt-scraper -v search id '0A2R27kCeD4' --max-depth 2```There are many more options that you can make use of. All of them are described in the Options section. Sometimes you may find yourself struggling with all the possible options.Fortunately, there is the `config` command for all the lazy typer out there.Setting a particular default option like the output directory to `~/my_data` is as easyas typing```sh$ yt-scraper config set encoding utf-8```Forgetful? Just double-check by typing `get` instead of `set`: ```sh$ yt-scraper config get encoding``````[STATUS] The value of 'encoding' is set to 'utf-8'.```## Configuration| Search options          | Default    | Description                                                                             ||-------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|| `-n`, `--number`        | 1          | Number of the videos fetched per level (can be specified several times) || `-d`, `--max-depth`     | 0          | Number of recursion steps to perform.                                                   || `-k`, `--api-key`       | *Required* | The API key that should be used to query the YouTube API v3.                            || `-o`, `--output-dir`    | *Optional* | Path to the directory where output files are saved                                      || `-f`, `--output-format` | csv        | Specifies the file format of output files.                                              || `-N`, `--output-name`   | *Optional* | Specifies the file name or prefix of output files.                                      || `-r`, `--region-code`   | de         | Return only videos which are unrestricted in the given region.                          || `-l`, `--lang-code`     | de         | Return videos mostly relevant to a specified language.                                  || `-s`, `--safe-search`   | none       | Filter sensitive or restricted videos.                                                  || `-e`, `--encoding`      | utf-8      | Transform fetched text to another encoding.                                             || `-u`, `--unique`        | False      | Do not process seen videos again                                                        || Global options        | Default           | Description                                                                       ||-----------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|| `-c`, `--config-path` | *System-specific* | Specifies a configuration file.

Typically this folder can be found at the following location:- Mac OS X: `~/Library/Application Support/YouTube Scraper`- Unix: `~/.config/youtube-scraper`- Windows: `C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Roaming\YouTube Scraper`If the folder does not exist, you may need to create it first.## Release History* 0.2.6     - Added [UNLICENSE](license-url) to project* 0.3.0    - Uploaded to [PyPI][pypi-url]* 0.4.0    - New command *search** 0.5.0    - Option `--depth` renamed to `--max-depth`    - Video attributes, such as title, description, channel are fetched    - More consistent option handling* 0.6.0    - New export feature: *csv*    - New command: *config*    - New API options: *region-code, lang-code and safe-search** 0.7.0    - New `--version` option    - New `--encoding` option    - New `--export-name` option    - New `--unique` option    - New input method by importing a file or reading from stdin    - Added prompt when encountering an API error* 0.8.0    - New `--format sql` SQLite export    - New `config where` command    - Multiple API keys with automatic key switching is now possible    - New `--include` option    - New `--exclude` option    - Renamed `input` argument to `file`    - Piping of urls is now possible## RoadmapEvery of these features is going to be a minor patch:- [X] Add node video data attributes, such as title and description.- [X] Add possibility to specify more than one API key to switch seamlessly.- [ ] Add possibility to query more than 50 videos on one level.- [ ] Add youtube-dl integration for downloading subtitles.- [ ] Add a testing suite.- [o] Add export functionality to CSV, SQLlite or Pandas.- [ ] Add more information about quota to README ## ContributingIf you come across any bugs or have a suggestion, please don't hesitate to [file an issue][git-new-issue-url].Contributions in any form are welcomed.

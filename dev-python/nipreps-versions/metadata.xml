	<longdescription>[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/nipreps_versions)](https://pypi.org/project/nipreps-versions/)[![Tox](https://github.com/nipreps/version-schemes/actions/workflows/tox.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nipreps/version-schemes/actions/workflows/tox.yml)# Nipreps version schemesThis package provides a `setuptools_scm` plugin for version schemes usedby the Nipreps family of projects.## UsageAdd `nipreps_versions` to your `build-system.requires` list, e.g.,```TOML[build-system]requires = [    &quot;flit_scm&quot;,    &quot;nipreps_versions&quot;,]build-backend = &quot;flit_scm:buildapi&quot;```or```TOML[build-system]requires = [    &quot;setuptools&quot;,    &quot;setuptools_scm&quot;,    &quot;nipreps_versions&quot;,]build-backend = &quot;setuptools.build_meta&quot;```Then request a nipreps version scheme:```TOML[tool.setuptools_scm]version_scheme = &quot;nipreps-calver&quot;```## SchemesCurrently, only one versioning scheme is implemented:### `nipreps-calver`As described in [Releases - Principles](https://www.nipreps.org/devs/releases/#principles),&gt; The basic release form is `YY.MINOR.PATCH`, so the first minor release of 2020 is 20.0.0, and the first minor release of 2021 will be 21.0.0, whatever the final minor release of 2020 is. A series of releases share a `YY.MINOR`. prefix, which we refer to as the `YY.MINOR.x` series. For example, the 20.0.x series contains version 20.0.0, 20.0.1, and any other releases needed.If the last tag was 22.1.0 and the year remains 2022, the development version is`22.2.0.devN`. When the year changes to 2023, the development version will become`23.0.0.devN`.If the branch is `maint/22.1.x`, then the computed version will be `22.1.1.devN`.If the branch is `rel/22.0.3` (and the last tag for that branch is 22.0.2), thenthe computed version will be `22.0.3.devN`.</longdescription>

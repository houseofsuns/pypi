	<longdescription># A Bottle of WikiA Bottle of Wiki (abbreviated _abow_) is a personal wiki. Use it for viewing andediting pages written in markdown directly in your browser. It is made to beusable both on mobile and desktop.While you won't be hosting Wikipedia on a Bottle of Wiki, it is easy to deployand does not require a database: pages are saved as text files. It has no notionof users, access rights, page history, comments, discussion or even editconflict. It is meant to be used by one person.A Bottle of Wiki is a wiki built with [bottle](https://bottlepy.org/).## InstallationTo run a Bottle of Wiki, you will need python3 installed on a unix-like machine.### Test (_a quick sip_)The easiest way to test a Bottle of Wiki is to install it in a virtualenvironment. You can do so with the following commands:```shpython3 -m venv abowsource abow/bin/activate```Or use your favorite virtualenv management tool.Then install a Bottle of Wiki and its dependencies with pip:```shpip install abow```_Optional_: If you want syntax highlighting when displaying code in your page,install the extra:```shpip install abow[extra]```Finally start the application with:```shbottle.py abow:application```If all went well, you can point your browser to &lt;http://127.0.0.1:8080/&gt; andstart editing. The pages will be saved in the current directory. If you arelooking for inspiration, a few markdown pages (including this README) are partof the [source distribution][sdist].[sdist]:https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/source/a/abow/abow-0.5.1.tar.gz### Deployment (_the whole bottle_)A Bottle of Wiki is a WSGI application, as such it can be hosted by anyWSGI-capable web server. The documentation of bottle has a page dedicated to the[deployment](https://bottlepy.org/docs/stable/deployment.html) that can be usedas inspiration. Detailing how to host a WSGI application is beyond the scope ofthis README as there are many options to choose from, but here is the mostimportant piece of advice:**Make sure the access is restricted.** A Bottle of Wiki has no concept of loginor user, so anyone with access can edit the pages. You can limit the access bysetting up HTTP authentication and encryption on your web server. You can alsoserve only on a local network and access it via a VPN.### ConfigurationA Bottle of Wiki can be customized with a .ini configuration file. A example isprovided in the source distribution, or you can generate it with the followingcommand:```shpython -c &quot;import abow.config;abow.config.print_file()&quot;```The example configuration is heavily commented and should be self-explanatory.It enable you to change where a Bottle of Wiki stores the pages and the localeused. You can also host the static assets (css, js, ...) outside of theapplication and serve them directly from a web server.The configuration is read from the following locations:* `/etc/abow/config`* `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/abow/config`, defaulting to `~/.config/abow/config`* `$ABOW_CONFIG`, if definedPaths are tried one after one and each configuration file can override thesettings of the previous ones.## Built WithA Bottle of Wiki depends on the following python packages:* [Bottle](https://bottlepy.org/) -- The WSGI micro-framework used* [Python-Markdown](https://python-markdown.github.io/)  -- The markdown interpreter* [PyMdown Extensions](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/)  -- Extensions for Python Markdown* [Pygments](https://pygments.org/) -- Syntax highlighter (_optional_)The following css and javascript packages are included:* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) version 5.3.0 -- CSS Toolkit* [Autosize](http://www.jacklmoore.com/autosize/) version 5.0.0  -- Script to automatically adjust textarea height## Things to do### Detection of edit conflictRight now if you edit a page from two browsers you can lose some modifications.Detecting that the page has been changed on the server while being edited wouldbe nice if you want to use a Bottle of Wiki with more than one user.### Page historyWhile you can avoid losing changes by setting up a backup on the server (and youshould anyway), integrating the page history in the wiki would make is easier toreview the page modifications.

	<longdescription># Microsoft Azure SDK for PythonThis is the Microsoft Azure Logic Apps Management Client Library.This package has been tested with Python 3.6+.For a more complete view of Azure libraries, see the [azure sdk python release](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/all).## _Disclaimer__Azure SDK Python packages support for Python 2.7 has ended 01 January 2022. For more information and questions, please refer to https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/20691_# UsageTo learn how to use this package, see the [quickstart guide](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt)For docs and references, see [Python SDK References](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/logic-apps)Code samples for this package can be found at [Logic Apps Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/browse/?languages=python&amp;term=Getting%20started%20-%20Managing&amp;terms=Getting%20started%20-%20Managing) on docs.microsoft.com.Additional code samples for different Azure services are available at [Samples Repo](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt/samples)# Provide FeedbackIf you encounter any bugs or have suggestions, please file an issue in the[Issues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues)section of the project. ![Impressions](https://azure-sdk-impressions.azurewebsites.net/api/impressions/azure-sdk-for-python%2Fazure-mgmt-logic%2FREADME.png)# Release History## 10.0.0 (2022-06-06)**Features**  - Model IntegrationServiceEnvironment has a new parameter identity  - Model Workflow has a new parameter identity**Breaking changes**  - Operation IntegrationServiceEnvironmentManagedApisOperations.begin_put has a new parameter integration_service_environment_managed_api## 9.0.0 (2020-12-18)**Features**  - Model IntegrationServiceEnvironmentProperties has a new parameter encryption_configuration## 9.0.0b1 (2020-10-31)This is beta preview version.For detailed changelog please refer to equivalent stable version 3.0.0 (https://pypi.org/project/azure-mgmt-logic/3.0.0/)This version uses a next-generation code generator that introduces important breaking changes, but also important new features (like unified authentication and async programming).**General breaking changes**- Credential system has been completly revamped:  - `azure.common.credentials` or `msrestazure.azure_active_directory` instances are no longer supported, use the `azure-identity` classes instead: https://pypi.org/project/azure-identity/  - `credentials` parameter has been renamed `credential`- The `config` attribute no longer exists on a client, configuration should be passed as kwarg. Example: `MyClient(credential, subscription_id, enable_logging=True)`. For a complete set of  supported options, see the [parameters accept in init documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#available-policies)- You can't import a `version` module anymore, use `__version__` instead- Operations that used to return a `msrest.polling.LROPoller` now returns a `azure.core.polling.LROPoller` and are prefixed with `begin_`.- Exceptions tree have been simplified and most exceptions are now `azure.core.exceptions.HttpResponseError` (`CloudError` has been removed).- Most of the operation kwarg have changed. Some of the most noticeable:  - `raw` has been removed. Equivalent feature can be found using `cls`, a callback that will give access to internal HTTP response for advanced user  - For a complete set of supported options, see the [parameters accept in Request documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#available-policies)**General new features**- Type annotations support using `typing`. SDKs are mypy ready.- This client has now stable and official support for async. Check the `aio` namespace of your package to find the async client.- This client now support natively tracing library like OpenCensus or OpenTelemetry. See this [tracing quickstart](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/core/azure-core-tracing-opentelemetry) for an overview.## 4.0.0rc2 (2019-01-11)**Bugfixes**  - Fixed JSON parsing problem that could raise unexpected exceptions## 4.0.0rc1 (2018-12-10)**Features**  - Added operation WorkflowsOperations.validate_by_location  - Added operation WorkflowsOperations.validate_by_resource_group  - Added operation IntegrationAccountsOperations.list_callback_url  - Added operation group WorkflowRunActionRequestHistoriesOperations  - Added operation group Operations  - Added operation group WorkflowRunActionScopeRepetitionsOperations  - Added operation group WorkflowVersionTriggersOperations  - Added operation group IntegrationAccountSessionsOperations  - Added operation group IntegrationAccountCertificatesOperations  - Added operation group IntegrationAccountSchemasOperations  - Added operation group    WorkflowRunActionRepetitionsRequestHistoriesOperations  - Added operation group IntegrationAccountAgreementsOperations  - Added operation group IntegrationAccountMapsOperations  - Added operation group IntegrationAccountPartnersOperations**Breaking changes**  - Removed operation WorkflowsOperations.validate_workflow  - Removed operation WorkflowsOperations.validate  - Removed operation WorkflowVersionsOperations.list_callback_url  - Removed operation IntegrationAccountsOperations.get_callback_url  - Removed operation group AgreementsOperations  - Removed operation group SessionsOperations  - Removed operation group CertificatesOperations  - Removed operation group SchemasOperations  - Removed operation group MapsOperations  - Removed operation group WorkflowRunActionScopedRepetitionsOperations  - Removed operation group PartnersOperations## 3.0.0 (2018-05-18)**Features**  - Model WorkflowTriggerListCallbackUrlQueries has a new parameter se  - Model WorkflowRun has a new parameter wait_end_time  - Model WorkflowRunTrigger has a new parameter scheduled_time  - Added operation IntegrationAccountsOperations.log_tracking_events  - Added operation    IntegrationAccountsOperations.regenerate_access_key  - Added operation IntegrationAccountsOperations.list_key_vault_keys  - Added operation    WorkflowRunActionsOperations.list_expression_traces  - Added operation PartnersOperations.list_content_callback_url  - Added operation AgreementsOperations.list_content_callback_url  - Added operation SchemasOperations.list_content_callback_url  - Added operation WorkflowsOperations.move  - Added operation WorkflowsOperations.validate_workflow  - Added operation WorkflowsOperations.list_callback_url  - Added operation WorkflowTriggersOperations.get_schema_json  - Added operation WorkflowTriggersOperations.reset  - Added operation WorkflowTriggersOperations.set_state  - Added operation MapsOperations.list_content_callback_url  - Added operation group IntegrationAccountAssembliesOperations  - Added operation group WorkflowRunActionScopedRepetitionsOperations  - Added operation group WorkflowRunActionRepetitionsOperations  - Added operation group    IntegrationAccountBatchConfigurationsOperations  - Added operation group WorkflowRunOperations  - Client class can be used as a context manager to keep the underlying    HTTP session open for performance**General Breaking changes**This version uses a next-generation code generator that *might*introduce breaking changes.  - Model signatures now use only keyword-argument syntax. All    positional arguments must be re-written as keyword-arguments. To    keep auto-completion in most cases, models are now generated for    Python 2 and Python 3. Python 3 uses the &quot;\*&quot; syntax for    keyword-only arguments.  - Enum types now use the &quot;str&quot; mixin (class AzureEnum(str, Enum)) to    improve the behavior when unrecognized enum values are encountered.    While this is not a breaking change, the distinctions are important,    and are documented here:    &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#others&gt; At a glance:      - &quot;is&quot; should not be used at all.      - &quot;format&quot; will return the string value, where &quot;%s&quot; string        formatting will return `NameOfEnum.stringvalue`. Format syntax        should be prefered.  - New Long Running Operation:      - Return type changes from        `msrestazure.azure_operation.AzureOperationPoller` to        `msrest.polling.LROPoller`. External API is the same.      - Return type is now **always** a `msrest.polling.LROPoller`,        regardless of the optional parameters used.      - The behavior has changed when using `raw=True`. Instead of        returning the initial call result as `ClientRawResponse`,        without polling, now this returns an LROPoller. After polling,        the final resource will be returned as a `ClientRawResponse`.      - New `polling` parameter. The default behavior is        `Polling=True` which will poll using ARM algorithm. When        `Polling=False`, the response of the initial call will be        returned without polling.      - `polling` parameter accepts instances of subclasses of        `msrest.polling.PollingMethod`.      - `add_done_callback` will no longer raise if called after        polling is finished, but will instead execute the callback right        away.**Bugfixes**  - Compatibility of the sdist with wheel 0.31.0## 2.1.0 (2017-04-18)  - Add several new workflows methods**Note**This wheel package is now built with the azure wheel extension## 2.0.0 (2017-03-16)  - Major new release(API Version 2016-06-01)## 1.0.0 (2016-08-30)  - Initial Release      - Workflow in ApiVersion 2016-06-01      - Everything else API Version 2015-08-01-preview</longdescription>

	<longdescription>About Dwolla============Dwolla is a software platform that makes it easy to move money betweenbanks. When using Dwolla APIs your software platform can move moneybetween any 2 bank accounts, or network members, with no per transactionfees.Our software platform is compatibale with all banks in the UnitedStates. The developer documents are designed to support our developmentpartners who are building on top of Dwolla’s branded platform (v1) orour white labeled infrastructure (v2).The Dwolla API developer portal lives here:https://developers.dwolla.com/Our API portal is available on GitHub here:https://github.com/Dwolla/developer-portalOur v1 API documentation is available here: https://docs.dwolla.com/Our v2 API documentation is available here: https://docsv2.dwolla.com/dwolla-python=============`|Join the chat at https://gitter.im/Dwolla/dwolla-python| &lt;https://gitter.im/Dwolla/dwolla-python?utm_source=badge&amp;utm_medium=badge&amp;utm_campaign=pr-badge&amp;utm_content=badge&gt;`_`|Build Status| &lt;https://travis-ci.org/Dwolla/dwolla-python&gt;`_The new and improved Dwolla library based off of the Python ``requests`` client. ``dwolla-python`` includes support for all API endpoints, and is the new library officially supported by Dwolla.Version-------2.3.2Installation------------``dwolla-python`` is available on `PyPi &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dwolla&gt;`_, and therefore can be installed automagically via `pip &lt;https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html&gt;`_.**The Python ``requests`` library is required for ``dwolla-python`` to operate. It is included as a dependency on this package if your environment does not already have it.***To install via pip:*::    pip install dwolla*To add to ``requirements.txt`` and make this a permanent dependency of your package:*``requirements.txt YourApp SomeLibrary==1.2.3 dwolla&gt;=2.0.0`` ``pip install -r requirements.txt``*To install directly from source:* ``git clone https://github.com/Dwolla/dwolla-python &amp;&amp; cd dwolla-python &amp;&amp; python setup.py install``Quickstart----------``dwolla-python`` makes it easy for developers to hit the ground running with our API. Before attempting the following, you should ideally create `an application key and secret &lt;https://www.dwolla.com/applications&gt;`_.-  Change settings in ``constants.py`` on-the-fly by doing ``from dwolla import constants``, ``constants.some_setting = some_value``.-  ``from dwolla import module`` where ``module`` is either ``accounts``, ``checkouts``, ``contacts``, ``fundingsources``, ``masspay``, ``oauth``, ``request``, or ``transactions``, or ``from dwolla import *`` to import all.Sample Code~~~~~~~~~~~``dwolla-python`` allows you to import only the modules you need.*For this example, we will get information about a Dwolla ID.*::    from dwolla import accounts    print accounts.basic('812-121-7199')or^^``dwolla-python`` also allows you to import the entire library to access everything at once.*For this example, we will get information about a Dwolla ID, as well as request 5.00 from that same ID.*::    from dwolla import *    # Get information about the ID    print accounts.basic('812-121-7199')    # Request $5.00 from that ID    print request.create('812-121-7199', 5.00)Configuration and Use~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Whenever you change settings, they will only be partially applied. This means that settings in ``constants.py`` will remain until they are changed. You can do so on-the-fly or by editing the file.Default Settings^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^::    client_id = 'YOUR ID HERE'    client_secret = 'YOUR SECRET HERE'    pin = 1234    oauth_scope = 'Send|Transactions|Balance|Request|Contacts|AccountInfoFull|Funding|ManageAccount'    access_token = 'OAUTH TOKENS GO HERE'    # Hostnames, endpoints    production_host = 'https://www.dwolla.com/'    sandbox_host = 'https://uat.dwolla.com/'    default_postfix = 'oauth/rest'    # Client behavior    sandbox = True    debug = True    host = None    rest_timeout = 15    proxy = FalseProxies^^^^^^^``dwolla-python`` also supports proxies. In order to set proxies, you must assign a python dictionary to the proxy constant in the following format:::    proxy = {        'http': 'http://someproxy:someport',        'https': 'https://anotherproxy:anotherport'    }Changing Settings^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^In order to use the library, you must use your own ``client_id``, ``client_secret``, or ``access_token``. It is generally recommended to modify ``constants`` as shown below, but client control flags also expose this functionality.::    # Import everything from the dwolla package    from dwolla import *    # Configure the library (change these)    constants.sandbox=False    constants.client_id = &quot;zbDwIC0dWCVU7cQtfvGwVwVjvxwQfjaTgkVi+FZOmKqPBzK5JG&quot;    constants.client_secret = &quot;ckmgwJz9h/fZ09unyXxpupCyrmAMe0bnUiMHF/0+SDaR9RHe99&quot;    constants.access_token = &quot;aK6DdCVlIsR1hKvTbp8VCwnvci8cwaTLlW9edtbHJVmKoopnoe&quot;    # Example 1: Get basic information for a user via    # their Dwolla ID.    print accounts.basic('812-202-3784')Specifying additional parameters~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~For the API^^^^^^^^^^^As of version ``2.2.0``, you are no longer required to pass in additional API parameters in a ``params={...}`` dictionary. You can just simply specify the name of the parameter and its value as in the example below.Example; Fetch a user's contacts, limit results to 5''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''``python def get(**kwargs):`` \`\`\`python from dwolla import contactscontacts.get(limit=5) \`\`\`**NOTE**: If a ``params={...}`` dictionary is passed, it will be used instead of any additional ``**kwargs`` parameters. This excludes the client control flags noted in the next session. This is done to preserve function calls made to versions prior to ``2.2.0``. The ``params`` parameter behavior will be deprecated as of ``3.x`` releases.Client Control Flags^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^``dwolla-python`` supports the following client control flags. They override any applicable settings in the ``constants`` module for the call which they are present in. They do not get sent to the Dwolla API and are popped out of ``**kwargs``.-  ``dwollaparse``   -  *Parses the API response obtained from the Dwolla API and returns data to the user.*   -  Default: ``dwolla``   -  Acceptable Values: ``raw`` (JSON-ify'd string), ``dict`` (Dictionary/Parsed JSON data), ``dwolla`` (an extension of ``default``, where the contents of the ``Response`` key are returned and the rest disposed).-  ``client_id``   -  *Overrides the ``client_id`` set in ``constants`` for the call which it is present in.*   -  Acceptable Values: (any valid client\_id)-  ``client_secret``   -  *Overrides the ``client_secret`` set in ``constants`` for the call which it is present in.*   -  Acceptable Values: (any valid client\_secret)-  ``alternate_token``   -  *Overrides the ``access_token`` set in ``constants`` for the call which it is present in.*   -  Acceptable Values: (any valid OAuth token)-  ``alternate_pin``   -  *Overrides the ``pin`` set in ``constants`` for the call which it is present in.*   -  Acceptable Values: (any valid PIN)Example; Fetch a user's contacts, limit results to 5, provide alternate OAuth token.''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''``python def get(**kwargs):`` \`\`\`python from dwolla import contactscontacts.get(limit=5, alternate\_token=&quot;Some alternate token.&quot;) \`\`\`--------------There are 9 quick-start files which will walk you through working with ``dwolla-python``'s classes/endpoint groupings.-  ``changeSettings.py``: Instantiate library with custom settings.-  ``accounts.py``: Retrieve account information, such as balance.-  ``checkouts.py``: Offsite-gateway endpoints, server-to-server checkout example.-  ``contacts.py``: Retrieve/sort through user contacts.-  ``fundingsources.py``: Modify and get information with regards to funding sources.-  ``masspay.py``: Create and retrieve jobs/data regarding MassPay jobs.-  ``oauth.py``: Examples on retrieving OAuth access/refresh token pairs.-  ``request.py``: Create and retrieve money requests/information regarding money requests.-  ``transactions.py``: Send money, get transaction info by ID, etc.Structure---------``dwolla-python`` is a conglomerate of multiple modules; each module in the ``dwolla/`` directory is named after a the endpoints that it covers (`similar to Dwolla's developer documentation &lt;https://developers.dwolla.com/dev/docs&gt;`_).Endpoint Modules~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Each endpoint module depends on ``Rest()`` in ``rest.py`` to fulfill ``GET``, ``DELETE``, ``POST``, and ``PUT`` requests.-  ``accounts.py``:-  ``basic()``: Retrieves basic account information-  ``full()``: Retrieve full account information-  ``balance()``: Get user balance-  ``nearby()``: Get nearby users-  ``autowithdrawalstatus()``: Get auto-withdrawal status-  ``toggleautowithdrawalstatus()``: Toggle auto-withdrawal-  ``checkouts.py``:-  ``create()``: Creates a checkout session.-  ``get()``: Gets status of existing checkout session.-  ``complete()``: Completes a checkout session.-  ``verify()``: Verifies a checkout session.-  ``contacts.py``:-  ``get()``: Retrieve a user's contacts.-  ``nearby()``: Get spots near a location.-  ``fundingsources.py``:-  ``info()``: Retrieve information regarding a funding source via ID.-  ``get()``: List all funding sources.-  ``add()``: Add a funding source.-  ``verify()``: Verify a funding source.-  ``withdraw()``: Withdraw from Dwolla into funding source.-  ``deposit()``: Deposit to Dwolla from funding source.-  ``masspay.py``:-  ``create()``: Creates a MassPay job.-  ``getjob()``: Gets a MassPay job.-  ``getjobitems()``: Gets all items for a specific job.-  ``getitem()``: Gets an item from a specific job.-  ``listjobs()``: Lists all MassPay jobs.-  ``oauth.py``:-  ``genauthurl()``: Generates OAuth permission link URL-  ``get()``: Retrieves OAuth + Refresh token pair from Dwolla servers.-  ``refresh()``: Retrieves OAuth + Refresh pair with refresh token.-  ``catalog()``: Returns a &quot;catalog&quot; of endpoints that are available for use with the current/passed OAuth token.-  ``request.py``:-  ``create()``: Request money from user.-  ``get()``: Lists all pending money requests.-  ``info()``: Retrieves info for a pending money request.-  ``cancel()``: Cancels a money request.-  ``fulfill()``: Fulfills a money request.-  ``transactions.py``:-  ``send()``: Sends money-  ``refund()``: Refunds money-  ``get()``: Lists transactions for user-  ``info()``: Get information for transaction by ID.-  ``stats()``: Get transaction statistics for current user.-  ``schedule()``: Schedule a transaction for a later date.-  ``scheduled()``: Get all scheduled transactions.-  ``scheduledbyid()``: Get a scheduled transaction by its ID.-  ``editscheduledbyid()``: Edit scheduled transaction by its ID.-  ``deletescheduledbyid()``: Delete a scheduled transaction by its ID.-  ``deleteallscheduled()``: Delete all scheduled transactions.Unit Testing------------``dwolla-python`` uses `unittest &lt;https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html&gt;`_ for unit testing. Integration testing is planned sometime in the future.To run the tests, install ``dwolla-python`` as per the aforementioned instructions and run:::    cd location/of/the/library    pip install unittest    python -m unittest discover tests/README------In order for the library's README file to display nicely on PyPi, we must use the ``*.rst`` file format. When making changes to this README file, please `use this tool &lt;http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/try/&gt;`_ to convert the ``*.md`` file to ``*.rst``, and make sure to keep both files updated.Changelog---------2.3.2 \* Fix bug json parsing bug in oauth.refresh() that prevented SDK from returning new tokens.2.3.1 \* Fix bug that prevented a code from being exchanged for a token.2.3.0 \* Pass authorization token through headers2.2.2 \* Fix to pass unit tests for python32.2.1 \* Support for Google App Engine added (thanks, @gae123)!2.2.0 \* **Potentially breaking changes!** \* Additional parameters are now passed in via ``**kwargs`` for both API and client control. \* API responses can now be specified in *any* endpoint using the ``dwollaparse`` flag.

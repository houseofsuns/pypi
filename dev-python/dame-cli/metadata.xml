	<longdescription># Desktop Application for Model Execution (DAME) [![Upload Python Package](https://github.com/mintproject/dame_cli/actions/workflows/python-publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mintproject/dame_cli/actions/workflows/python-publish.yml) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/mintproject/dame_cli/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/mintproject/dame_cli)The Desktop Application for Model Execution (DAME) is an application for executing environmental models in any local environment or server through a command line interface.DAME contains a registry of model containers and input data files, as well as metadata about what input data needs to be loaded to run regional configurations and setups of any given model.Given a model identifier (e.g., TopoFlow for the Awash region: `topoflow36_2.1.0_Awash`), DAME downloads the model container and its execution environment, and fetches the datasets needed (e.g., soil data, elevation data, etc). Then users can run the model with different input scenarios.DAME works in Linux, MacOS and Windows.  It is installed through a simple pip command.## Requirements### Docker Configuration [MacOS, Windows, Linux]:1. Docker2. Python &gt;= 3.6### Docker DAME can use Docker to manage and run containers of software components. - [Installation on Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)- [Installation on MacOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)- [Installation on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)### Python 3DAME uses Python. To install Python, just follow the steps below:- [Installation on Linux](https://realpython.com/installing-python/#linux)- [Installation on MacOS](https://realpython.com/installing-python/#macos-mac-os-x)- [Installation on Windows](https://realpython.com/installing-python/#windows)## InstallationTo install the latest version of DAME, open a terminal and run:```bashpip install dame-cli```## DocumentationFull documentation of the CLI, including usage examples, can be found at: https://dame-cli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</longdescription>

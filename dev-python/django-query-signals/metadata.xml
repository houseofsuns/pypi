What problem does it solve?===========================Django sends many signals, including when a model instance is created, deletedand updated. However when using bulk methods like bulk_create or delete. Thereis no signal send, with this library signals are send on the following methods:- bulk_create- delete - get_or_create- update_or_create- updateA signal will be send before and after the method is executed.How do I install it?====================.. sourcecode:: shell  pip install django-query-signalsAdding to Django (using integrator)-----------------------------------.. sourcecode:: shell  &gt;&gt;&gt; import django_integrator  &gt;&gt;&gt; django_integrator.add_application('django_query_signals')If you don't want to use the above, you can just add 'django_query_signals' toyour installed apps.How do I use it?================From the namespace django_query_signals you can import the below signals whichyou can connect to via the usual way. - pre_bulk_create - post_bulk_create, - pre_delete - post_delete - pre_get_or_create - post_get_or_create - pre_update_or_create - post_update_or_create - pre_update - post_updateFor example:.. sourcecode:: shell  &gt;&gt;&gt; @receiver(post_bulk_create)  &gt;&gt;&gt; def callback(signal, sender, args):  &gt;&gt;&gt;       passThe argument 'signal' is the signal that is connected, 'sender' is theunderlying model class and 'args' is a dictionary which the method in querysetis called with, this is supplemented with 'self' which contains the querysetinstance and if the connecting signal is a 'post' type the key 'return' is alsoadded which contains the value the method has returned. If you connect to the 'pre' type signal, changing the 'args' and 'self' willalso change the actual execution of the method.Caveat======This library relies on monkey patching django.db.models.query.QuerySet, thus ifyour instance also monkey patches the same thing or you use a custom QuerySet inyour Manager, then there is a good chance that this library will not work at allfor you, however most likely you can work around this issue by examining thesignals.py file in this library.  What license is this?=====================Two-clause BSDHow can I get support?======================Please use the repo's bug tracker to leave behind any questions, feedback,suggestions and comments. I will handle them depending on my time and what looksinteresting.

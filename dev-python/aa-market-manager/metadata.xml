As there is no way to tell who has docking (even the owner corporation is not a guarantee),- Will detect and use any tokens loaded by other means, if you request the scopes as part of a wider scoped app (Such as an Audit tool etc.)- Managed WatchConfigs, to allow external apps to manage and create their own configs.  - Very basic currently  - Supports Generating and maintaining WatchConfigs for a given fit.## Planned Features- Private Structure Orders  - Failing to resolve will disable the token mapping to avoid error-bans.- Configurable Alerts  - Re-List detection, Highlight characters buying and relisting items past a configured threshold.- Managed WatchConfigs, to allow external apps to manage and create their own configs.  - Framework exists, need code.  - Buybacks?!?- Manually defining Tokens that are on ACLs for use in pulling structures from the get_universe_structures_structure_id endpoint which wont require Station_Manager.## Installation### Step 1 - Django Eve UniverseMarket Manager is an App for [Alliance Auth](https://gitlab.com/allianceauth/allianceauth/), Please make sure you have this installed. Market Manager is not a standalone Django ApplicationMarket Manager needs the App [django-eveuniverse](https://gitlab.com/ErikKalkoken/django-eveuniverse) to function. Please make sure it is installed before continuing.### Step 2 - Install app```bashpip install aa-market-manager```### Step 3 - Configure Auth settingsConfigure your Auth settings (`local.py`) as follows:- Add `'marketmanager'` to `INSTALLED_APPS`- Add below lines to your settings file:```python## Settings for AA-MarketManager# Market OrdersCELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE['marketmanager_fetch_public_market_orders'] = {    'task': 'marketmanager.tasks.fetch_public_market_orders',    'schedule': crontab(minute=0, hour='*/3'),}CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE['marketmanager_fetch_all_character_orders'] = {    'task': 'marketmanager.tasks.fetch_all_character_orders',    'schedule': crontab(minute=0, hour='*/3'),}CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE['marketmanager_fetch_all_corporation_orders'] = {    'task': 'marketmanager.tasks.fetch_all_corporation_orders',    'schedule': crontab(minute=0, hour='*/3'),}CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE['marketmanager_fetch_all_structure_orders'] = {    'task': 'marketmanager.tasks.fetch_all_structure_orders',    'schedule': crontab(minute=0, hour='*/3'),}# Structure InformationCELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE['marketmanager_fetch_public_structures'] = {    'task': 'marketmanager.tasks.fetch_public_structures',    'schedule': crontab(minute=0, hour=4),}CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE['marketmanager_update_private_structures'] = {    'task': 'marketmanager.tasks.update_private_structures',    'schedule': crontab(minute=0, hour=5),}CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE['marketmanager_fetch_all_corporations_structures'] = {    'task': 'marketmanager.tasks.fetch_all_corporations_structures',    'schedule': crontab(minute=0, hour=6),}# Watch ConfigsCELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE['marketmanager_update_managed_supply_configs'] = {    'task': 'marketmanager.tasks.update_managed_supply_configs',    'schedule': crontab(minute=0, hour=2),}CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE['marketmanager_run_all_watch_configs'] = {    'task': 'marketmanager.tasks.run_all_watch_configs',    'schedule': crontab(minute=0, hour='*/3'),}# Background TasksCELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE['marketmanager_update_all_type_statistics'] = {    'task': 'marketmanager.tasks.update_all_type_statistics',    'schedule': crontab(minute=0, hour=0, day_of_week=1),}# CleanupCELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE['marketmanager_garbage_collection'] = {    'task': 'marketmanager.tasks.garbage_collection',    'schedule': crontab(minute=0, hour=0),}```### Step 4 - Maintain Alliance Auth- Run migrations `python manage.py migrate`- Gather your staticfiles `python manage.py collectstatic`- Restart your project `supervisorctl restart myauth:`### Step 5 - Pre-Load Django-EveUniverse- `python manage.py eveuniverse_load_data map` This will load Regions, Constellations and Solar Systems### Step 6 (Optional) - Further Pre-Load Django-EveUniverse_This is less required the more you have used eveuniverse in the past_- `python manage.py eveuniverse_load_data ships` This will load Ships, which are nearly universally on the market- `python manage.py marketmanager_preload_common_eve_types` This will preload a series of evetypes using Groups and Categories I've analyzed to be popular on the market.### Step 7 - ConfigurationIn the Admin interface, visit `marketmanager` or `&lt;AUTH-URL&gt;/admin/marketmanager`### Public Market ConfigurationSelect the Regions you would like to pull Public Market Data for- Please note Jita is not trivial and will take several minutes to pull and process depending on your hardware.### TypeStatistics Calculation ConfigurationsSelect the Regions you would like to calculate Percentiles, Medians and Weighted Averages for- We always calculate these stats across New Eden, but these will likely match Public Market Configuration or the regions where your Private Structures are located.- Supply Configs require The Forge selected to use The Forge(Jita) Relative Pricing.### Private ConfigsMap the appropriate tokens with Access to Docking and Market (this cant be assumed), to the right Structures And/Or Corps.### Watch ConfigsConfigure some supply alerts## WatchConfig Types### Supply Check- Check for a Volume of orders for an Item  - May define a Maximum (Sell/Minimum (Buy) price  - Valid Location Filters, Structure, Solar System, Region and Structure_TypeExample. Warn if there is less than 1,000,000 Units of Oxygen Isotopes under 1,000 ISK/Unit, in 9KOE-A.### Bargain Finder WIP- ~~Highlights orders that meet a defined config.Example. Notify if Naglfars under 3,000,000,000 ISK/Unit are on sale in Curse NPC Stations~~### Scalp Checker WIP~~- ~~Highlights Character/Corporation orders (not public), that breach Jita/Universe price.Example. Notify Leadership that Ariel Rin is selling Nanite Repair Paste at over 500% Jita price in Staging.~~## Managed Watch Configs### Fittings- Managed By App = `fittings`- Managed App-Identifier = `fittings.fit.&lt;FIT_ID&gt;`- Mananged App Reason = A user facing reason- ... a slightly limited subset of WatchConfig settings that will be replicated on eatch WatchConfig created.## Permissions| Perm | Admin Site  | Perm | Description || --- | --- | --- | --- || basic_market_browser | nill | Can access the Standard Market Browser | Can access the normal user facing market browser| advanced_market_browser | nill | Can access the Advanced Market Browser | Can access the more advanced management browser with private details| order_highlight_user | nill | Can access other character's data for own alliance. | Enables Highlighting a users own Orders in the Market Browser| order_highlight_corporation | nill | Can access other character's data for own corp. | Enables Highlighting the orders of a users corporation in the Market Browser| can_add_token_character | nill | Can add a Character Token with required scopes | Enables the &quot;Add Character Token&quot; button to request the needed scopes from a user| can_add_token_corporation | nill | Can add a Corpration Token with required scopes | Enables the &quot;Add Corporation Token&quot; button to request the needed scopes from a user## Settings| Name | Description | Default || --- | --- | --- |`MARKETMANAGER_CLEANUP_DAYS_STRUCTURE`| Number of days without an update, before considering a Structure stale and to be deleted | 30`MARKETMANAGER_CLEANUP_DAYS_ORDER`| Number of days without an update, before considering an Order stale and to be deleted | 30`MARKETMANAGER_TASK_PRIORITY_ORDERS`| Celery task priority for Order tasks | 5`MARKETMANAGER_TASK_PRIORITY_STRUCTURES`| Celery task priority for Structure tasks | 4`MARKETMANAGER_TASK_PRIORITY_BACKGROUND`| Celery task priority for Background tasks | 7`MARKETMANAGER_TASK_PRIORITY_SUPPLY_CONFIGS`| Celery task priority for SupplyConfig tasks, This is Lower than Orders to ensure it runs while Orders are all up to date | 6`MARKETMANAGER_TASK_PRIORITY_PRICE_CONFIGS`| Celery task priority for PriceConfig tasks, This is Lower than Orders to ensure it runs while Orders are all up to date | 6`MARKETMANAGER_WEBHOOK_COLOUR_ERROR`| Webhook colour for Errors | 16711710`MARKETMANAGER_WEBHOOK_COLOUR_WARNING`| Webhook colour for Errors | 14177041`MARKETMANAGER_WEBHOOK_COLOUR_INFO`| Webhook colour for Errors  | 42751`MARKETMANAGER_WEBHOOK_COLOUR_SUCCESS`| Webhook colour for Success | 6684416`MARKETMANAGER_TYPESTATISTICS_MINIMUM_ORDER_COUNT` | Minimum number of Orders to exist before calculating Medians, Averages and Percentiles | 10## Third Party IntegrationsCreating Watch Configs from external applications is relatively straight forward and Market Manager provides an Optional Model for keeping track of these Watch Configs.How an app maintains these Watch Configs is left to the developer, but Fittings provides a decent starting point using App Signals and referencing the Managed Watch Config model.managed_app should follow python referencing convention. `fittings`, `projectname.modulename`managed_app_identifier is up to the app, but i would suggest following Fittings, `fittings.fit.{fit.id}`managed_app_reason is presented to users as to_why_ a managed config exists, `Standard MWD Eagle x50````pythondef marketmanager_active() -&gt; bool:    return apps.is_installed(&quot;marketmanager&quot;)if marketmanager_active():    from marketmanager.models import WatchConfig, ManagedAppConfig    # ...    # Maintain your Watch Configs here    # ...```- Fittings (Currently from Market Manager)  - Create and Maintain Watch Configs for x number of a Fit or Fits.## ContributingMake sure you have signed the [License Agreement](https://developers.eveonline.com/resource/license-agreement) by logging in at &lt;https://developers.eveonline.com&gt; before submitting any pull requests.

Check the [online documentation](https://code-for-venezuela.github.io/c4v-py/)- [Installation](#installation)- [Development](#development)- [Pending](#pending)## InstallationUse pip to install the package:```python3pip install c4v-py```## Usage_TODO_[Can you help us? Open a new issue inminutes!](https://github.com/code-for-venezuela/c4v-py/issues/new/choose)## ContributingThe following tools are used in this project:- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is used as package manager.- [Nox](https://nox.thea.codes/) is used as automation tool, mainly for testing.- [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) is the mandatory formatter tool.- [PyEnv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki) is recommended as a tool to handle multiple python versions in your machine.The library is intended to be compatible with python ~3.6.9, ~3.7.4 and ~3.8.2. But the primary version to support is ~3.8.2.The general structure of the project is trying to follow the recommendationsin [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/).The main difference lies in the source code itself which is not constraint to data science code.### Setup1. Install pyenv and select a version, ie: 3.8.2. Once installed run `pyenv install 3.8.2`2. Install poetry in your system3. Clone this repo in a desired location `git clone https://github.com/code-for-venezuela/c4v-py.git`4. Navigate to the folder `cd c4v-py`5. Make sure your poetry picks up the right version of python by running `pyenv local 3.8.2`, if 3.8.2 is your right version.6. Since our toml file is already created, we need to get all dependencies by running `poetry install`. This step might take a few minutes to complete.7. Install nox8. From `c4v-py` directory, on your terminal, run the command `nox -s tests` to make sure all the tests run.If you were able to follow every step with no error, you are ready to start contributing. Otherwise, [open a new issue](https://github.com/code-for-venezuela/c4v-py/issues/new/choose)!## Roadmap- [ ] Add CONTRIBUTING guidelines- [ ] Add issue templates- [ ] Document where to find things (datasets, more info, etc.)  - This might be done (in conjunction) with Github Projects. Managing tasks there might be a good idea.- [ ] Add LICENSE- [ ] Change the authors field in pyproject.toml- [ ] Change the repository field in pyproject.toml- [ ] Move the content below to a place near to the data in the data folder or use the reference folder.      Check [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) for details.- [ ] Understand what is in the following folders and decide what to do with them.  - [ ] brat-v1.3_Crunchy_Frog  - [ ] creating_models  - [x] data/data_to_annotate  - [ ] data_analysis- [ ] Set symbolic links between `brat-v1.3_Crunchy_Frog/data` and `data/data_to_annotate`. `data_sampler` extracts to `data/data_to_annotate`. Files placed here are read by Brat.  - [ ] Download Brat - `wget https://brat.nlplab.org/index.html`  - [ ] untar brat - `tar -xzvf brat-v1.3_Crunchy_Frog.tar.gz`  - [ ] install brat - `cd brat-v1.3_Crunchy_Frog &amp;&amp; ./install.sh`  - [ ] replace default annotation conf for current configuration - `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dieko95/c4v-py/master/brat-v1.3_Crunchy_Frog/annotation.conf -O annotation.conf`  - [ ] replace default config.py for current configuration - `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dieko95/c4v-py/master/brat-v1.3_Crunchy_Frog/config.py -O config.py`</longdescription>

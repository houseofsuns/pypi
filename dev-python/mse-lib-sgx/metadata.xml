	<longdescription># MicroService Encryption Lib SGX## OverviewMSE lib SGX bootstraps the execution of an encrypted ASGI/WSGI Python web application for [Gramine](https://gramine.readthedocs.io/).The library is responsible for:- Configuring the SSL certificates with either:  - *RA-TLS*, a self-signed certificate including the Intel SGX quote in an X.509 v3 extension  - *Custom*, the private key and full keychain is provided by the application owner  - *No SSL*, the secure channel may be managed elsewhere by an SSL proxy- Decrypting Python modules encrypted with XSala20-Poly1305 AEAD- Running the ASGI/WSGI Python web application with [hypercorn](https://pgjones.gitlab.io/hypercorn/)## Technical detailsThe flow to run an encrypted Python web application is the following:1. A first self-signed HTTPS server using RA-TLS is launched waiting to receive a JSON payload with:   - UUID, a unique application identifier provided to `mse-bootstrap` as an argument   - the decryption key of the code   - Optionally the private key corresponding to the certificate provided to `mse-bootstrap` (for *Custom* certificate)2. If the UUID and decryption key are the expected one, the configuration server is stopped, the code is decrypted and finally run as a new server## Installation ```console$ pip install mse-lib-sgx```## Usage```console$ mse-bootstrap --helpusage: mse-bootstrap [-h] --host HOST --port PORT --app-dir APP_DIR --uuid                     UUID [--version] [--debug]                     (--self-signed EXPIRATION_DATE | --no-ssl | --certificate CERTIFICATE_PATH)                     applicationBootstrap ASGI/WSGI Python web application for Graminepositional arguments:  application           ASGI application path (as module:app)optional arguments:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  --host HOST           hostname of the configuration server, also the                        hostname of the app server if `--self-signed`  --port PORT           port of the server  --app-dir APP_DIR     path of the python web application  --uuid UUID           unique application UUID  --version             show program's version number and exit  --debug               debug mode with more logging  --self-signed EXPIRATION_DATE                        generate a self-signed certificate for the web app                        with a specific expiration date (Unix time)  --no-ssl              use HTTP without SSL  --certificate CERTIFICATE_PATH                        custom certificate used for the SSL connection,                        private key must be sent through the configuration                        server```</longdescription>

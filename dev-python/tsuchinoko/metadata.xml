Live visualizations show details of measurements, and provide feedback on the adaptive engine's decision-making process. The parameters of the adaptive engine can also be tuned live to explore and optimize the search procedure.While Tsuchinoko is designed to allow custom adaptive engines to drive experiments, the [gpCAM](https://gpcam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) engine is a featured inclusion. This tool is based on a flexible and powerful Gaussian process regression at the core.A Tsuchinoko system includes 4 distinct components: the GUI client, an adaptive engine, and execution engine, and acore service. These components are separable to allow flexibility with a variety of distributed designs.![Tsuchinoko running simulated measurements](docs/source/_static/running-score.PNG)## InstallationThe latest stable Tsuchinoko version is available on PyPI, and is installable with `pip`. It is recommended that youuse Python 3.9 for this installation.```bashpip install tsuchinoko```For more information, see the [installation documentation](https://tsuchinoko.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html).## Resources* Documentation: https://tsuchinoko.readthedocs.io/en/latest* Report an issue in Tsuchinoko: [New Bug Report](https://github.com/lbl-camera/tsuchinoko/issues/new?labels=bug)## About the nameJapanese folklore describes the [Tsuchinoko](https://cryptidz.fandom.com/wiki/Tsuchinoko) as a wide and short snake-like creature living in the mountains of westernJapan.

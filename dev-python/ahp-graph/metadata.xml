	<longdescription># ahp_graph - Python Attributed Hierarchical Port GraphAHP Graphs - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.06492.pdfRequires Python3.9 at a minimum. There is a &quot;noTyping&quot; branch which works with older versions of Python (like 3.6)### Ubuntu apt packages:```Bashapt install graphviz libgraphviz-dev```### RHEL/CentOS yum packages:```Bashyum install graphviz graphviz-devel```### Python3 packages:```Bashpython3 -m pip install pygraphviz orjson```## Useful Tips- Assembly names are automatically prefixed to the expanded devices names when the graph is flattened- Besides graph construction, the main features that ahp_graph provides are several outputs  - `SSTGraph.build()` will immediately turn your graph into SST components and begin a simulation  - `SSTGraph.write_json()` will output the graph along with parameters in JSON format  - `DeviceGraph.write_dot()` will output the graph in DOT format and optionally draw SVGs with them- All output generated by ahp_graph goes into a folder called 'output'  - This is for the `SSTGraph.write_json()` and `DeviceGraph.write_dot()` functions- SST global parameters are set by adding things to the DeviceGraph attr field- SST component parameters are set by adding things to the Device attr field- You can still do normal SST Python things (examples below):  - `sst.setProgramOption()`  - `sst.setStatisticLoadLevel()`  - `sst.setStatisticOutput()`- `SSTGraph.build()` returns a dictionary of devices with their name as the key  - You can use this to enable statistics for devices after they are created- If you plan to build the graph with ahp_graph partitioning and run with MPI, remember to include the `--parallel-load=SINGLE` flag to sst  - `--parallel-load` by default will work with multiple unique files  - ahp_graph can generate the graph for each rank using a single file, so it needs the value 'SINGLE'- By default sst grabs all command line parameters  - You can pass parameters to the python script by putting `-- ` before your script parameters</longdescription>

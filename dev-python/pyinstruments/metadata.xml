	<longdescription>=============================================pyinstruments: data acquisition toolkit=============================================*program less and do more science... better*What is it==========**pyinstruments** is a Python package to control/get data from measurement andautomation devices. Control of the remote instruments can be done via one of the following protocols:    - ivi drivers (using the lower level package pyivi)  - visa  - serialUsing IVI-drivers greatly simplifies your life because :  1/. The lower level layer is fully transparent for the user (pyivi provides a common interface for each instrument type).    2/. **zero** extra work is needed to interface an instrument for which an IVI driver is provided.pyinstruments is composed of two **independant** packages (can be run on 2 remote computers!).  - **pyhardwaredb** for the hardware communication (This package itself is a thin wrapper around pyhardware). Because it heavily relies on ivi-drivers and com-interoperability, this package is intended to run on a windows machine.  - **curvefinder** to display in quasi real-time the curves acquired (This module could be run on any platform).The strict separation between plotting and data-acquistion processes ensures that scripted data-acquisitions won't be affected by user interactions or plotting dead-times.Main Features=============The curves are stored in a (django-abstracted) database with all necessary metadata.(bandwidth, averaging, date, comment, name...) together with a list of user-defined tags to quickly identify the curves. The curvefinder module allows monitoring new incoming curves, as well as queryingthe database for old curve by date, tags...The hardware module has a Graphical User Interface to quickly get a curve from an instrument and configure the way instruments are interfaced.Dependencies============Direct dependancies for pyinstruments are:  - django &gt; 1.5  - PyQt4  - guidata  - guiqwt  - pyhardware &lt;-- pyivi &lt;-- (ctypes + comtypes)Installation============The windows installer takes care of all the dependancies that are not standards in version 2.7.3.1 of pythonxy.The other option to install pyinstruments is to use pip from a command shell (also available in pythonxy)::pip install pyinstrumentspyinstruments and its three 'exotic' dependencies can also be uninstalled using pip::pip uninstall pyinstrumentspip uninstall pyhardwarepip uninstall pyiviTry it out!===========The installation is single click (since v 0.1.15), desktop icons are created to launch both graphical user interfaces.The project is hosted on GitHub, and still in a starting phase, contributions and feedbackare warmly welcome!&lt;https://github.com/SamuelDeleglise/pyinstruments&gt;</longdescription>

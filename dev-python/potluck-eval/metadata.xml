	<longdescription># `potluck`Code for automatically evaluating Python programming tasks, including a`flask` WSGI server for handling submissions.Specifications API design by Peter Mawhorter.Server design by Peter Mawhorter, Scott Anderson, and Franklyn Turbak.Based on `codder` program by Ben Wood w/ contributions by Franklyn Turbakand Peter Mawhorter.## DependenciesThe core evaluation code depends on the `jinja2`, `pygments`, `markdown`,`importlib_resources`, `beautifulsoup4`, and `python_dateutil` packages.Optional dependencies (get them using e.g., `python -m pip installpotluck-eval[test]`):- `[test]`: Tests depend on `pytest`, and you can run them using `tox` if    you want.- `[expectations]`: Integration with `optimism` is available to require    and grade student unit tests.- `[turtle_capture]`: Full support for capturing `turtle` drawings    requires the `Pillow` package (version 6.0.0 or later), as well as a    Ghostscript installation (which is not simply a PyPI package and    needs to be installed manually). Support for other image-producing    code is possible, but would also require `Pillow`.- `[synth]`: Integration with `wavesynth` is available for capturing    audio produced by that package. Support for other audio libraries    is not built in but is possible.- `[server]`: If you want to run the `potluck_server` WSGI app, you'll    need `flask` and `flask_cas`. If you're running the WSGI app on a    server without a windowing system but still want to be able to    evaluate submissions that use graphics (notably submissions which use    the `turtle` module), there is support for using `xvfb-run` (which    would have to be installed separately as it's not a PyPI package).- `[security]` For full server security, you should also install    `flask_talisman`, and `flask_seasurf`, but these are not required for    running the server and won't be used if they're not present (although    this introduces some extra security vulnerabilities).- `[https_debug]` If you want to use a self-signed certificate for HTTPS    while hosting the WSGI server locally for debugging purposes, you'll    need `pyopenssl`. This is inconvenient, so it's not recommended    unless you want to develop the server side of things.- `[formatting]` For better formatting of markdown instructions,   `pymarkdown-extensions` can be installed; it will be used if present,   and the most important feature it provides is indented fenced code   blocks so that they can be placed into list items.## InstallingTo install from PyPI, run the following command on the command-line:```shpython3 -m pip install potluck-eval```Confirm installation from within Python by running:```py&gt;&gt;&gt; import potluck```Once that's done, you can perform run the built-in tests on thecommand-line:```shpython -m potluck.tests```Note that if you get a command not found error, the `potluck_eval` scriptmight not have been installed somewhere that's on your command line'spath, which you'll need to fix to get the tests to run.If you want to see what evaluation looks like yourself instead of justrunning automated tests that clean up after themselves, in your installed`potluck` directory inside of `site-packages` there's a `testarea`directory; inside `testarea/test_course/fall2021` you should be able torun the following commands:```shpotluck_eval -t functionsTest --rubricpotluck_eval -t functionsTest --instructionspotluck_eval -t functionsTest -u perfectpotluck_eval -t functionsTest -u imperfectpotluck_eval -t functionsTest --check```The first command creates a rubric for the &quot;functionsTest&quot; task in the`rubrics` directory, and the second creates instructions in the`instructions` directory. The third and fourth commands will evaluate theprovided test submissions for the same task, creating reports as`reports/(im)perfect/functionsTest_TIMESTAMP.html` where TIMESTAMP is atime-stamp based on when you run the command. The fifth command runs thespecification's built-in tests and prints out a report.If the tests pass and these commands work, then `potluck` is properlyinstalled and you can start figuring out how to set up your ownevaluation area and define your own tasks. The documentation for the`potluck.specifications` module describes the task-definition process andprovides a worked example that shows off many of the possibilities; youcan find that example specification at:`potluck/testarea/test_course/fall2021/specs/functionsTest/spec.py`## Evaluation SetupOnce `potluck` is installed and working , you'll need to set up your ownfolder for evaluating submissions. The `potluck/testarea` folder containsan example of this, including task specifications and examplesubmissions (note that it's missing a `submissions` folder because all ofits submissions are examples, as the `potluck_config.py` there notes).You can test things out there, but eventually you'll want to create yourown evaluation directory, which should have at minimum:- `tasks.json`: This file specifies which tasks exist and how to load  their specifications, as well as which submitted files to look for and  evaluate. You can work from the example in  `potluck/testarea/test_course/fall2021/tasks.json`.- A `specs` folder with one or more task sub-folders, named by their task  IDs. Each task sub-folder should have a `spec.py` file that defines the  task, as well as `starter/` and `soln/` folders which hold starter and  solution code. These files and folders need to match what's specified  in `tasks.json`.- A `submissions` folder, with per-user submissions folders containing  per-task folders that have actual submitted files in them. Note that if  you're going to use the `potluck_server` WSGI app, this can be created  automatically.If you're going to use the `potluck_server` WSGI app, your evaluationdirectory will also need:- `potluck-admin.json`: Defines which users have admin privileges and  allows things like masquerading and time travel. Work from the provided  example `potluck/testarea/test_course/fall2021/potluck-admin.json`.Finally, to run automated tests on your specifications (always a goodidea) you will need:- An `examples` folder with the same structure as the `submissions`  folder.## Running `potluck_server`To set up `potluck_server`, in addition to an evaluation directory set upas described above, you'll need to create a `ps_config.py` file in adirectory of your choosing (could be the same as the base evaluationdirectory if you want); there's a `rundir` directory inside the installed`potluck_server` directory which has an example of this; in addition to`ps_config.py`, `secret` and `syncauth` files will be created in theserver run-directory if not present.For testing purposes, you will not need to change the `ps_config.py` filefrom the defaults supplied in `ps_config.py.example`, but you'll want toedit it extensively before running the server for real. When running in areal WSGI context, you'll also need the `potluck.wsgi` file that'spresent in the `potluck_server/rundir` directory.Once `ps_config.py` has been created, from the `potluck_server/rundir`directory (or whatever directory you set up) you should be able to run:```pypython -m potluck_server.app```to run the WSGI app on a local port in debugging mode. It will printseveral messages including one or more prompts about running withoutauthentication, and you'll have to press enter at these prompts toactually start the server, after which it should provide you with a linkyou can use in a browser to access it.NOTE THAT THE POTLUCK WEB APP ALLOWS AUTHENTICATED USERS TO RUN ARBITRARYPYTHON CODE ON THE SERVER!In addition to this, in debugging mode the server has no authentication,and is only protected by the fact that it's only accessible to localhost.Accordingly, you will need to set up CAS (Central Authentication Server)via the values in `ps_config.py` to run the server for real. If you don'thave access to a CAS instance via your company or institution, you caneither set one up yourself, or you'll have to modify the server to usesome other form of authentication. It is also *strongly* recommended thatyou install the `flask_talisman` and `flask_seasurf` modules, which willbe used to provide additional security only if they're available. If`pyopenssl` is installed alongside `flask_talisman`, a self-signedcertificate will be used to provide HTTPS even in debugging mode, mostlyjust to maximize similarity between debugging &amp; production environments.In debugging mode, you will automatically be logged in as the &quot;test&quot;user, and with the default `potluck-admin.json` file, this will be anadmin account, allowing you to do things like view full feedback beforethe submission deadline is past. With the default setup, you should beable to submit files for the testing tasks, and view the feedbackgenerated for those files (eventually, you may have to modify the duedates in the example `tasks.json` for this to work). You can find filesto submit in the `potluck/testarea/test_course/fall2021/submissions`directory, and you can always try submitting some of the solution files.See the documentation at the top of `python_server/app.py` for a run-downof how the server works and what's available.To actually install the server as a WSGI app, you'll need to follow thestandard procedure for whatever HTTP server you're using. For example,with Apache, this involves installing mod_wsgi and creating variousconfiguration files. An example Apache mod_wsgi configuration might looklike this (to be placed in `/etc/httpd/conf.d`):```cfg# ================================================================# Potluck App for code submission &amp; grading (runs potluck_eval)# the following is now necessary in Apache 2.4; the default seems to be to deny.&lt;Directory &quot;/home/potluck/private/potluck/potluck_server&quot;&gt;    Require all granted&lt;/Directory&gt;WSGIDaemonProcess potluck user=potluck processes=5 display-name=httpd-potluck home=/home/potluck/rundir python-home=/home/potluck/potluck-python python-path=/home/potluck/rundirWSGIScriptAlias /potluck /home/potluck/rundir/potluck.wsgi process-group=potluck```## SecurityRunning the potluck_server WSGI app on a public-facing port represents asignificant security vulnerability, since any authenticated user cansubmit tasks, and the evaluation mechanisms currently do not use anysandboxing, meaning that they RUN UNTRUSTED PYTHON CODE DIRECTLY ON YOURSERVER (even if they used sandboxing, which is a target feature for thefuture, they would be vulnerable to any means of circumventing thesandboxing used).You therefore need to trust that your CAS setup is secure, and trust thatyour users will be responsible about submitting files and about keepingtheir accounts secure. If you can't depend on these things, DO NOT runthe web app.Even if you do not run the web app, and instead collect submissions viasome other mechanism, the evaluation machinery still runs submitted codedirectly. You will need to trust the users submitting tasks forevaluation, and watch out for accidental mis-use of resources (e.g.,creating files in an infinite loop). It's not a bad idea to run theentire evaluation process in a virtual machine, although the details ofsuch a setup are beyond this document.## DocumentationExtracted documentation can be viewed online at:[https://cs.wellesley.edu/~pmwh/potluck/docs/potluck/](https://cs.wellesley.edu/~pmwh/potluck/docs/potluck/)You can also read the same documentation in the docstrings of the sourcecode, or compile it yourself if you've got `make` and `pdoc` installed byrunning the `make docs` script on the command-line (note that shenanigansare necessary to prevent pdoc from trying to import the testsubmissions).## Changelog- `potluck_eval` version 1.2.27 fixes column alignment in copied table  contents for gradesheets. This is `potluck_server` version 1.2.19.- `potluck_eval` version 1.2.26 adds grade override mechanisms for  individual exercises and for exercise groups. This is `potluck_server`  version 1.2.18.- `potluck_eval` version 1.2.25 fixes a print formatting bug, and also  has an ugly patch for the image-tabs-don't-work bug in image comparison  feedback. It's `potluck` version 1.1.22.- `potluck_eval` version 1.2.24 fixes a bug in 1.2.23 that prevents  exercise detail views from working entirely; this is `potluck_server`  version 1.2.17.- `potluck_eval` version 1.2.23 adds a chronological list of all exercise  submissions to the exercise detailed view; this is `potluck_server`  version 1.2.16.- `potluck_eval` version 1.2.22 fixes percentage displays on the full  gradesheet, adds category classes to them for color. Also shortens  grade item titles to regularize column widths in the full grade table,  and hides students whose section is set to &quot;__hide__&quot;, along with  exercise groups and/or projects which have &quot;hide&quot; set to true. This is  `potluck_server` version 1.2.15.- `potluck_eval` version 1.2.21 fixes some JS issues (like +24h buttons  not working on evaluation pages) and adds a full-course gradesheet view  (link is on the dashboard before the quick links for admins). This is  `potluck_server` version 1.2.14 and `potluck` version 1.1.20.- `potluck_eval` version 1.2.20 fixes one bug in 1.2.19. It includes  `potluck_server` version 1.2.13.- `potluck_eval` version 1.2.19 fixes bugs in 1.2.18. It includes  `potluck_server` version 1.2.12.- `potluck_eval` version 1.2.18 fixes bugs in 1.2.17. It includes  `potluck_server` version 1.2.11.- `potluck_eval` version 1.2.17 includes `potluck` version 1.1.19 and  `potluck_server` version 1.2.10 which clarify/simplify the &quot;at  least N&quot; messages for partial completion language and also show full  eval info before the initial deadline to get rid of the &quot;at least  partially complete&quot; confusing language. The new potluck_server version  also empowers config values, letting them come from per-course task  info in almost all cases, and in many cases letting them come from  individual tasks, projects, or exercise groups within a tasks.json  file. Server config and defaults in the code still provide default  values.- `potluck_eval` version 1.2.16 includes `potluck_server.storage` version  0.3.1 which fixes a bug in v0.3 that always causes an internal server  error. I need a better testing setup T_T- `potluck_eval` version 1.2.15 includes `potluck_server.storage` version  0.3. Turns out I hadn't been version bumping that file for a while even  though plenty of changes have occurred ^.^; In any case, this fixes a  bug that resulted in an internal server error when certain None grade  values were explicit.- `potluck_eval` version 1.2.14 includes `potluck` version 1.1.18 which  adds a return to `capture_file_contents` for chaining.- `potluck_eval` version 1.2.13 includes `potluck_server` version 1.2.9;  it's a bugfix for issues in 1.2.8.- `potluck_eval` version 1.2.12 includes `potluck_server` version 1.2.8,  which fixes exercise deadline handling so that extensions (and other  deadline adjustments) can retroactively change the lateness of  particular exercise submissions.- `potluck_eval` version 1.2.11 fixes a bug where the extension manager  would show initial extension values from the person viewing the page,  not from the student whose extensions were being managed (student  extension values were still saved properly). It also fixes a floating  point division error for servers running Python 2.7 which causes  inaccurate pset combined grades to show up in some cases on the  gradesheet. It also sets the default expectation level in the `meta`  submodule to 0 to work with the new flat reports that are sortable. It  also adds sorting functionality to reports instead of just  instructions/rubrics.- `potluck_eval` version 1.2.10 makes the `amend_exercises` function more  robust in the face of missing credit info.- `potluck_eval` version 1.2.9 ensures that the exercises route displays  exercises for the target user, not the logged-in user. Also adds a  mechanism for hiding psets from the dashboard via tasks.json. Also adds  extension management for exercises, and factors deadlines into points  calculations for exercises. Also adds exercise IDs to the dashboard.- `potluck_eval` version 1.2.8 fixes an integer-point division issue in  computing credit fractions when running the server on Python 2. It also  adds solution links for exercise groups to be displayed only after the  deadline to those who have a &quot;complete&quot; or better evaluation. Added  gradesheet views for exercise groups. Added +/- 24-hour buttons for  extensions in the extension manager.- `potluck_eval` version 1.2.7 adds a stderr error message to the  potluckDelivery output when the server indicates that a submission is  not complete, and redirects GET requests to `route_deliver` to the  dashboard. It also adds percentages to the dashboard for exercise  groups, updates the exercise format within exercise groups in  tasks.json to a list of dictionaries so that ordering is preserved. The  former dictionary-of-exercises format won't crash things but isn't  fully supported any more.- `potluck_eval` version 1.2.6 fixes a bug in 1.2.5 with safe_join that  affects older versions of Python/werkzeug/flask. It also pushes  `potluck` version to 1.1.16, which adds custom categorization to the  rubric and makes a flat metric the default. This breaks some of the  prep stuff but we'll fix that later.- `potluck_eval` version 1.2.5 fixes a bug in 1.2.4 that should have been  caught by basic testing T_T.- `potluck_eval` version 1.2.4 disables CSRF for route_deliver and also  fixes some python2-specific errors with deliver and improves some  delivery error messages. It also gets rid of outcome-count-checking  when outcome counts aren't specified in `tasks.json`, and introduces an  author info timeout for `potluckDelivery`. Plus, `deliverOutcome` will  now automatically grab code with a mark matching the suite name even if  `grabCode` isn't specified, as long as `optimism` is available.  Finally, an attempt was made to improve backward compatibility for  cases where 'exercises' may not be defined in `tasks.json`, and/or  where the concepts file is missing.- `potluck_eval` version 1.2.3 re-fixes the flashes-instead-of-errors idea  form 1.2.2 that still wasn't implemented correctly. It also introduces  timeliness overrides and puts timing info below problem set IDs to save  space on the dashboard.- `potluck_eval` version 1.2.2 fixes the flashes-instead-of-errors idea  form 1.2.1 that wasn't implemented correctly.- `potluck_eval` version 1.2.1 adds a version number to the  `potluckDelivery` script. It also turns some exceptions into flashes  for missing concepts in exercise configuration to make typos less  punishing.- `potluck_eval` version 1.2 brings things up-to-date with optimism  2.7.4, and represents a major shakeup to the potluck server's handling  of grades + feedback, hence the new minor version number. Full feedback  is now displayed during the initial submission period, and timeliness  points separate from task points are assigned based on presence/absence  of an initial submission and an eventual at-least-almost-complete  revision (or initial submission). It improves display for finalized  unsubmitted pooled tasks (no longer marked as issues if any task in the  pool was submitted). It also adds a file `potluckDelivry` for  delivering exercise results via function call, and a whole exercise  category on the dashboard w/ details view to collect, store, and  display those results. Gradesheet for exercises is not present yet, but  should be coming along soon.- `potluck` version 1.1.14 makes single-loop dictionary and set  comprehensions matchable with a default Loop object, and adds set  comprehensions to the relevant pattern variables.- `potluck` version 1.1.13 upgrades the `returns_a_new_value` harness to  match the `report_argument_modifications` harness in reporting  positions of arguments rather than their names.- `potluck` version 1.1.12 includes `Try` and `With` `Check` sub-classes  in `specifications.py` (although these have severe limitations) and  fixes `validation.py` to be up-to-date with `optimism` version 2.6.4.  It also sets the default subslip to be equal to the number of  sub-rules, meaning that by default, any match is considered partial if  the syntax we're looking for was found. It also adds some tests for  try/with matching to the `mast` tests, including one that fails for now  because pattern vars in the 'as -name-' position of an except block  aren't supported. Try/except matching in general is extremely  fragile...- `potluck` version 1.1.11 includes better support for testing optimism  tests cases defined within specific functions, via a testing harness in  the `validation` sub-module.- `potluck` version 1.1.10 includes generator expressions and dictionary  comprehensions when matching loops generally and comprehensions  specifically. The wording of rubrics for these is also improved. Also  sets the default behavior of `DontWasteBoxes` to ignore loop variables.- Version 1.0/1.1 brings potluck up-to-date with optimism 2.0, and adds a  validation mode for checking test cases against solution code. Some  improvements to resubmission and admin-based submission on the server  are also included.</longdescription>

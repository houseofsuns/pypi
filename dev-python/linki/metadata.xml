It also means it is easy to share parts of it with others - they can copy individual edits and articles to their wiki (or wikis.) This lets people work on edits to the wiki in a way similar to the &quot;production&quot; version of the wiki, without needing to edit it directly.# A quick previewClick this to see kitty, tux, and dragon present a standard use-case of linki.[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/YMSxZgCy7PNEdYfxdDxShE7oj.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/YMSxZgCy7PNEdYfxdDxShE7oj)## Why would I want to use this?There are a lot more reasons why you'd want to use a distributed wiki than just preventing hasty, embarrassing edits.### Data ReplicationLet's say you're making a wiki focused on something that might not be a host's favorite thing. You don't need to worry about it being deleted, and you don't need to worry about the hassle of setting it back up. You have a copy locally. Everyone who edits it has a copy as well. You'll be able to find a new host and get up and running as fast as possible. If something happens to you and your wiki at the same time, someone else can get a copy running quickly as well.### Inconsistent InternetLet's say you have unreliable internet. It's a satellite connection, or it's cheaper to use at night than during the day where you live, or something like that. Point is, you don't have 24/7 internet access. Good news - You have a whole copy of the wiki on your person. In your phone, on a flash drive, whatever. You don't need the internet to edit it. You don't need the internet or a server to share it locally either.### Copying Off Another WikiLet's say you're interested in bird watching, and you find a great bird wiki using linki. You run into an issue - their articles on birds local to you aren't anywhere near the quality of the rest of their articles. You feel a duty to improve on what they started. You have the power to copy those articles and edit on top of them, keeping attributions and history for all of them. You're not limited to individual articles either. You can copy whole groups or even the entire wiki.# InstallationWe're on PyPI! You can just run `pip install linki` and continue.# Getting StartedYou can get started by running `linki init` to start your wiki. The initialization procedure should have created a folder that we'll be calling this folder the `working directory`. This is where your wiki will live.The working directory should have a hidden folder in it called `.linki`. Don't touch this. It's for linki to handle, and it's a sensitive folder.## Terminology### Titleslinki puts documents known as &quot;Titles&quot; on display. Named after the fact that they're content associated with a title. Titles are Articles, under the hood. They're just special because they're what's on display. Other Articles are considered to be history.### ArticlesArticles are an archive of all changes to a Title whether or not that Title is on display. When you do commands to a title, you're doing a command to an Article. Anything that works on an Article should work on a Title. This may not always be the case the other way around.### DraftsDrafts are your works in progress. They aren't titles and they aren't articles. When you're using the command line application they're the files in your working directory. You can `publish` drafts so that they become Titles and get archived as Articles.# Writing your DraftsWriting Drafts is pretty easy - just use markdown in any text editor you prefer. As long as it can save to markdown directly, you're golden. (Future versions will support anything [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) can!)If a Draft is inside of a folder, it'll remember that - When you get to publishing it'll save the folder structure as part of the Title. You can edit your drafts like you would normal files. Move folders around. Rename things. linki will know what you changed when you ask it to publish your drafts.# Publishing DraftsWhen you're ready to turn your Drafts into Titles and archive them as Articles, run `linki publish`. When a reader interacts with your wiki, they'll see those Titles. If something goes wrong while you're publishing don't fret - it'll roll back the publishing and your wiki will be safe.# Copying Articles from Other WikisSee something you like on another wiki? Maybe a version of an article you wrote that you like better? Or an article you think would be important on your wiki that you don't have? You can copy it! You can copy it _and_ its history! When this thing has comments, it'll copy the comments too! Just run `linki copy &lt;url of article&gt;` and it'll copy all of that over to your wiki, ready to go. You can treat it like one of your articles - edit its draft, change its groups, whatever. It's yours to change now.Your wiki will only update Drafts you haven't changed. This will let you copy an article and change the title without changing the draft. You might need to do a bit of effort to add your draft's changes to the article, but this avoids what is known as an &quot;[edit conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_conflict)&quot;.## Copying a wikiIf you want to, you can even copy a whole wiki. Just do `linki copy &lt;url to wiki&gt;` and it'll work the same - think of it as running copy on every article in the wiki.## Starting with a copy of a WikiInstead of running `linki init` you can use `linki copy`. This will automatically initialize the folder, and then run the copy command like normal for you. It's a great way to get up and running with a pre-made set of articles you want to build on top of.# Subscribing to Wikis,There are likely wikis that you'd like to copy from consistently. This might be a copy of your wiki deployed to a server or a wiki that covers a topic very related to your own. You can use `linki subscribe &lt;url&gt;` to do this.If you subscribe to the same URL multiple times, you'll unsubscribe from the wiki and then subscribe again. This is a good way to change settings on a subscription.## Reading your SubscriptionsWhen you subscribe to a wiki, linki will show you updates to wikis with `linki inbox`.## Subscribing to Multiple WikisYou can subscribe to multiple wikis. You do this by using `linki subscribe` any number of times. If you aren't subscribed to the wiki already, it'll add it to your list of subscriptions.# Making your Wiki public`linki serve` will provide you with a ready-to-go web server that can display all your titles and articles. Your drafts will stay private, they're called drafts for a reason. It'll run up a web server with a basic wiki interface that displays your titles. You can use `linki serve --home=&lt;title&gt;` to set a title as a home page. If you do not, it will display a list of your ungrouped groups and titles.This also makes your wiki public for other linki installations to subscribe to! It'll also create an API to access your titles and articles. You can read more about the API options in the [API Documentation](API.md).## I don't want to have some of these featuresUse `linki serve --no-web` to only serve your API and Subscription access. You can also do `linki serve --no-api` to turn off the API. Similarly, you can do `linki serve --no-subscribe`. You can do any mix of these, but if you do all three it might just be better not to serve in the first place.## I don't want to host this on my personal computerSmart! You can run `linki serve` on a server, and this is the recommended option.## I don't want to maintain a serverLook for public linki hosts soon. [Rough Drafts](https://roughdrafts.xyz/) is aiming to change into one pretty soon. Linki hosts will likely have advanced tools to help you, such as user groups or multi-author wiki tools. They'll likely also offer you search and discovery tools too.# Contributing to other wikisYou can contribute to other wikis with `linki contribute &lt;url&gt;` similarly to subscribing, but in reverse. The wiki you're contributing to will need to use `linki authenticate` to let you send them contributions. After that, it's as simple as using `linki publish --contribute` when you're ready to send out changes to wikis that you contribute to. They'll receive your contributions in their inbox, similar to a subscription, and can accept or refuse them just like a subscription.# QuestionsThese are questions I either asked myself or that someone asked me while discussing this concept.## Why should I use this instead of gitGit isn't very oriented toward non-developers, and its purpose is different. Existing wiki solutions built on top of git are great, but they are not purpose-built.For example, a linki hosting service could provide permissions on who can read what articles by article, group, or wiki. It could also introduce something like pull requests for articles.## How do I prevent plagiarism?If you use a linki hosting service it might be able to act as a Timestamp Authority. If this is the case, anyone who trusts that host can use it to verify who published something first and you can use it to store copies of the verification.Also, Articles identify themselves based on the articles they have been edited from. If you can find a public record of an article's history you can verify the authenticity of its identifier by comparing it against that.## How do I delete something?Assume anything you publish is out there forever. You can send out a blank update, but you can't guarantee people will copy it. Some clients might be able to receive that or another special signal as a request to delete an entire article's history manually.For data integrity reasons, there's no built-in way to request the deletion of an article's history, as it might break an edit history tree.If being able to delete your articles is a concern, develop a personal [web of trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust), encrypt your articles using a secret key made just for linki, and use another communication channel to request your public key be deleted when you need to make your data inaccessible.# ThanksThank You, Ward Cunningham, for sharing the [concept of a Federated Wiki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdwLczSgvcc) at TEDx and laying the groundwork necessary to build off of.</longdescription>

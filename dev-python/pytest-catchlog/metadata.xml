	<longdescription>pytest-catchlog===============.. image:: https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg   :alt: Join the chat at https://gitter.im/eisensheng/pytest-catchlog   :target: https://gitter.im/eisensheng/pytest-catchlog?utm_source=badge&amp;utm_medium=badge&amp;utm_campaign=pr-badge&amp;utm_content=badgepy.test plugin to catch log messages.  This is a fork of `pytest-capturelog`_... _`pytest-capturelog`: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-capturelog/Installation------------The `pytest-catchlog`_ package may be installed with pip or easy_install::    pip install pytest-catchlog    easy_install pytest-catchlog.. _`pytest-catchlog`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-catchlog/Usage-----If the plugin is installed log messages are captured by default and foreach failed test will be shown in the same manner as captured stdout andstderr.Running without options::    py.test test_pytest_catchlog.pyShows failed tests like so::    ----------------------- Captured stdlog call ----------------------    test_pytest_catchlog.py    26 INFO     text going to logger    ----------------------- Captured stdout call ----------------------    text going to stdout    ----------------------- Captured stderr call ----------------------    text going to stderr    ==================== 2 failed in 0.02 seconds =====================By default each captured log message shows the module, line number,log level and message.  Showing the exact module and line number isuseful for testing and debugging.  If desired the log format and dateformat can be specified to anything that the logging module supports.Running pytest specifying formatting options::    py.test --log-format=&quot;%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s&quot; \            --log-date-format=&quot;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S&quot; test_pytest_catchlog.pyShows failed tests like so::    ----------------------- Captured stdlog call ----------------------    2010-04-10 14:48:44 INFO text going to logger    ----------------------- Captured stdout call ----------------------    text going to stdout    ----------------------- Captured stderr call ----------------------    text going to stderr    ==================== 2 failed in 0.02 seconds =====================These options can also be customized through a configuration file::    [pytest]    log_format = %(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s    log_date_format = %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%SAlthough the same effect could be achieved through the ``addopts`` setting,using dedicated options should be preferred since the latter doesn'tforce other developers to have ``pytest-catchlog`` installed (while atthe same time, ``addopts`` approach would fail with 'unrecognized arguments'error). Command line arguments take precedence.Further it is possible to disable reporting logs on failed testscompletely with::    py.test --no-print-logs test_pytest_catchlog.pyShows failed tests in the normal manner as no logs were captured::    ----------------------- Captured stdout call ----------------------    text going to stdout    ----------------------- Captured stderr call ----------------------    text going to stderr    ==================== 2 failed in 0.02 seconds =====================Inside tests it is possible to change the log level for the capturedlog messages.  This is supported by the ``caplog`` funcarg::    def test_foo(caplog):        caplog.set_level(logging.INFO)        passBy default the level is set on the handler used to catch the logmessages, however as a convenience it is also possible to set the loglevel of any logger::    def test_foo(caplog):        caplog.set_level(logging.CRITICAL, logger='root.baz')        passIt is also possible to use a context manager to temporarily change thelog level::    def test_bar(caplog):        with caplog.at_level(logging.INFO):            passAgain, by default the level of the handler is affected but the levelof any logger can be changed instead with::    def test_bar(caplog):        with caplog.at_level(logging.CRITICAL, logger='root.baz'):            passLastly all the logs sent to the logger during the test run are madeavailable on the funcarg in the form of both the LogRecord instancesand the final log text.  This is useful for when you want to assert onthe contents of a message::    def test_baz(caplog):        func_under_test()        for record in caplog.records:            assert record.levelname != 'CRITICAL'        assert 'wally' not in caplog.textFor all the available attributes of the log records see the``logging.LogRecord`` class.You can also resort to ``record_tuples`` if all you want to do is to ensure,that certain messages have been logged under a given logger name with agiven severity and message::    def test_foo(caplog):        logging.getLogger().info('boo %s', 'arg')        assert caplog.record_tuples == [            ('root', logging.INFO, 'boo arg'),        ]Changelog=========List of notable changes between pytest-catchlog releases... %UNRELEASED_SECTION%`1.2.2`_-------------Released on 2016-01-24 UTC.- [Bugfix] `#30`_ `#31`_ - Fix ``unicode`` vs ``str`` compatibility issues between Python2 and Python3.  (Thanks goes to `@sirex`_ for reporting the issue and providing a fix!).. _#30: https://github.com/eisensheng/pytest-catchlog/issues/30.. _#31: https://github.com/eisensheng/pytest-catchlog/issues/31.. _@sirex: https://github.com/sirex`1.2.1`_-------------Released on 2015-12-07.- [Bugfix] #18 - Allow ``caplog.records()`` to be modified.  Thanks to Eldar Abusalimov for the PR and Marco Nenciarini for reporting the issue.- [Bugfix] #15 #17 - Restore Python 2.6 compatibility. (Thanks to Marco Nenciarini!).. attention::    Deprecation warning: the following objects (i.e. functions, properties)    are slated for removal in the next major release.    - ``caplog.at_level`` and ``caplog.set_level`` should be used instead of      ``caplog.atLevel`` and ``caplog.setLevel``.      The methods ``caplog.atLevel`` and ``caplog.setLevel`` are still      available but deprecated and not supported since they don't follow      the PEP8 convention for method names.    - ``caplog.text``, ``caplog.records`` and      ``caplog.record_tuples`` were turned into properties.      They still can be used as regular methods for backward compatibility,      but that syntax is considered deprecated and scheduled for removal in      the next major release.Version 1.2-----------Released on 2015-11-08.- [Feature] #6 - Configure logging message and date format through ini file.- [Feature] #7 - Also catch logs from setup and teardown stages.- [Feature] #7 - Replace deprecated ``__multicall__`` use to support future Py.test releases.- [Feature] #11 - reintroduce ``setLevel`` and ``atLevel`` to retain backward compatibility with pytest-capturelog.  Also the members ``text``, ``records`` and ``record_tuples`` of the ``caplog`` fixture can be used as properties now.Special thanks for this release goes to Eldar Abusalimov.  He provided all of the changed features.Version 1.1-----------Released on 2015-06-07.- #2 - Explicitly state Python3 support and add configuration for running  tests with tox on multiple Python versions. (Thanks to Jeremy Bowman!)- Add an option to silence logs completely on the terminal.Version 1.0-----------Released on 2014-12-08.- Add ``record_tuples`` for comparing recorded log entries against expected  log entries with their logger name, severity and formatted message.</longdescription>

	<longdescription>pyx509: X.509 Certificate and PKCS7 Parser / Verifier for Python################################################################This is a fork of a fork of a fork of the original project:    py3x509 - Python library for parsing X.509    Copyright (C) 2009-2012  CZ.NIC, z.s.p.o. (http://www.nic.cz)* Forked from https://github.com/ph4r05/px509* Forked from https://github.com/erny/pyx509* Forked from https://github.com/hiviah/pyx509Updates by me rename the module to 'x509' and update to Python3 only.    Copyright (C) 2017 &lt;siege@siege.org&gt; (https://github.com/cniemira/py3x509)Work in progress!Description===========This is probably the most complete parser of X.509 certificates in python.Code is in alpha stage! Don't use for anything sensitive. I wrote it (based onprevious work of colleagues) since there is no comprehensive python parser forX.509 certificates. Often python programmers had to parse openssl output.Advantages----------* I find it less painful to use than parsing output of 'openssl x509'  somewhat stricter in extension parsing compared to opensslDisadvantages-------------* It's slow compared to openssl (about 2.3x compared to RHEL's openssl-1.0-fips)* Currently not very strict in what string types in RDNs it accepts* API is still rather ugly and has no documentation yet; code is nasty at some  places (and there's some old dangling code like pkcs7/verifier.py)Dependencies============* pyasn1 &gt;= 0.1.7Installation============Install with pip::    pip install py3x509License=======LGPL v2 or later.See LICENSE.txt.Known bugs and quirks=====================* Subject alternative name doesn't show all subtypes,  but 'DNS', 'dirName' and 'email' are supported.* Name constraints don't distinguish among various GeneralName subtypes* Some extensions are not shown very nicely when put in string format* Not all extensions are supported* String types accepted for various RDN subelements are rather too permissive* RDN string conversion does not conform to RFC 4514* Badly formed extensions are ignored if not marked critical  * easy to switch to more strict behavior  * other clients do this as well; RFC 5280 specifies behavior for unknown    elements in extensions in appendix B.1, but does not cover all cases (e.g.    element exists, but with string type different from spec)TODO====* Cleanup: This module has it's own pyasn1 models. Look if we can  reuse the pyasn1_modules.rfc2459 X509 cert model.* Cleanup: Currently, the signature verifier does not work.</longdescription>

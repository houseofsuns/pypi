Powered by the _Breadth First Search_, or _BFS_, algorithm to search through the network, this converter can find conversions from a particular Unit (or ratio of units) to any other Unit (or ratio) as long as a path connecting them exists.This package is under development and is regularly updated. Back compatibility is intended to be maintained when possible.  ## What Contains This Package- It is loaded with a network of units preloaded for distances, area, volume, mass and time conversions defined for SI and Imperial systems according to the definition of each Unit, i.e.: _1_foot = 12_inches_.- Prefixes applied to the basic units, like in SI units _k_ to _m_ to make _km_, are loaded as a network of conversion paths allowing the algorithm to apply the prefix to any other unit in the same system.- It provides a class _Unit_ powered with arithmetic and logic operations to intrinsically consider unit conversions when making calculations.    ## How To Use ItThis package is intended to be used in two ways:  - Calling the function `units()` to define instances of the __Units__ class, that holds _values associated to units_, or, _quantities_.  - As unit converter with the function `convert()` to explicitly make conversion of numeric variables and instances.    ### To use the _units converter_ function `convert()`:  `from unyts import convert`  `convert(value, from_units, to_units)`  where:  - _value_ is a number (int, float, numpy.array, etc)  - *from_units* is a string defining the units of _value_ (i.e.: 'ft')  - *to_units* is a string representing the units to convert _value_ (i.e.: 'km')    ### To create instances of the _Unit_ class using the `units()` function:  `from unyts import units`  `variable = units(value, units)`  - _value_ is a number (`int`, `float`, `numpy.array`, etc)- _units_ is a string defining the units of _value_ (i.e.: 'ft')Then simply operate with the **Unit** instances or the variables related to them:   In: units(6, 'in') + units(1, 'ft')  Out: 18_in  ### Referring to the `Unit` class:`from unyts import Unit`  - The `Unit` class is not intended to be used to create **Unit _instances_**, but to allow checking if other object `isinstance` of **Unit**: i.e.: `isinstance(variable, Unit)`  - In order to create instances of **Unit** it is convenient to use the `units()` function as it will return the appropriate **Unit _subclass_**.    ### Uses examples:  For further examples of use, the following Jupyter notebook &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ayaranitram/unyts/blob/master/unyts_demo.ipynb&quot;&gt;**unyts_demo**&lt;/a&gt; intends to be a guide on how to use this converter and units classes.    ## To install this package:  Install it from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.org/search/?q=unyts&quot;&gt;pypi.org&lt;/a&gt; repository:  `pip install unyts`  or upgrade to the latest version:  `pip install --upgrade unyts`    ## Optional requisites:  The main functionalities are purely Python powered and does not require any other package to work but, if present, some commonly known packages are used to improve the operability of `unyts`:  - `NumPy` to be able to deal with iterables not of nparray type, like (list of values)  - `Pandas` to be able to recognize Series and DataFrames  - `cloudpickle` to be able to save internal dictionaries and network to cache file, for faster loading  - `openpyxl` if willing to export the units network to a pandas DataFrame  </longdescription>

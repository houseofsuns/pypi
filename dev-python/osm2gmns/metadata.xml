	<longdescription>osm2gmns====================================| **Authors**: Jiawei Lu, Xuesong (Simon) Zhou| **Email**: jiaweil9@asu.edu, xzhou74@asu.eduosm2gmns is an open-source Python package that enables users to conveniently obtain and manipulate any networks from OpenStreetMap (OSM). With a single line of Python code, users can obtain and model drivable, bikeable, walkable, railway, and aeroway networks for any region in the world and output networks to CSV files in GMNS format for seamless data sharing and research collaboration. osm2gmns mainly focuses on providing researchers and practitioners with flexible, standard and ready-to-use multi-modal transportation networks, as well as a bunch of customized and practical functions to facilitate various research and applications on traffic modeling.**If you use osm2gmns in your research, please cite our paper. Lu, J., Zhou, X.S., 2022. Modeling partially schedulable connected and automated mobility systems on layered virtual-track networks: modeling framework and open-source tools.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/364341612.**Main Features====================================- Obtain any networks from OSM. osm2gmns parses map data from OSM and output networks to   csv files in GMNS format.- Standard network format. osm2gmns adopts GMNS as the network format for seamless data   sharing and research collaboration.- Ready-to-use network. osm2gmns cleans erroneous information from osm map data and is able   to fill up critical missing values, i.e., lanes, speed and capacity, to quickly provide   ready-to-use networks.- Directed network. two directed road links are generated for each bi-directional osm ways identified by osm2gmns- Multi-module support. five different network types are supported, including auto, bike, walk, railway, and aeroway- Customized and practical functions to facilitate traffic modeling. functions include   complex intersection consolidation, moevement generation, traffic zone creation, short link combination,   network visualization.- Multi-Resolution modeling. osm2gmns automatically construct the corresponding mesoscopic and microscopic  networks for any macroscopic network in GMNS format.Materials====================================`user's guide`_: detailed package introductions, solutions for potential installation issues.`Github homepage`_: example networks, reporting bugs... _`OpenStreetMap`: https://www.openstreetmap.org.. _`GMNS`: https://github.com/zephyr-data-specs/GMNS.. _`user's guide`: https://osm2gmns.readthedocs.io.. _`Github homepage`: https://github.com/jiawlu/OSM2GMNS</longdescription>

The projectresults in the building and publishing of two components: * Python Plugin Runtime Library * Base InsightConnect Plugin Docker Images ![InsightConnect Python Plugin Runtime Diagram](plugin-runtime-diagram.png)Docker images created during the build and deployment of this project are uploaded to the [Rapid7 Docker Repositories](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/rapid7/repositories).Further [documentation](https://komand.github.io/python/start.html) for building an InsightConnect plugin is available to get started.## Development of the InsightConnect Plugin RuntimeThe Python Runtime codebase is built to support Python 3.8+ as of version 4.0.0. The following dependencies will need to be installed when developing or testing the Plugin Runtime:- Python 3.8- Docker- make- tox### Getting Started#### Building Python LibraryTo build and install the plugin runtime library locally, first create a Python virtual environment for the particular Python version and activate it. Then build, install, and confirm the package has been installed.```&gt; python3 -m venv venv&gt; source venv/bin/activate&gt; pip install -e ./&gt; pip list | grep insightconnect-plugin-runtimeinsightconnect-plugin-runtime 4.0.0```#### Building the InsightConnect Plugin Runtime Docker ImagesCurrently the `3-38` dockerfile is used by default when building the docker image. If you want to specify another dockerfile for testing purposes, such as `3-38-slim`, you can pass it as an argument.```make build-image DOCKERFILE=3-38-slim```This will overwrite the default `3-38`, provided that it exists in the `dockerfiles` directory.### Testing Sample PluginThe easiest way to test changes to the runtime is by running it locally against one of the [sample plugins](./samples) included in the repository. Make sure a virtual environment has been activated and then pass in the sample directory name as a parameter:```&gt; make sample=example run-sample```The plugin will be started in `http` mode and listening at `http:0.0.0.0:10001`:```[2020-02-13 23:21:13 -0500] [56567] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 19.7.1[2020-02-13 23:21:13 -0500] [56567] [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:10001 (56567)[2020-02-13 23:21:13 -0500] [56567] [INFO] Using worker: threads[2020-02-13 23:21:13 -0500] [56571] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 56571```To override Gunicorn config export environment variable GUNICORN_CONFIG_FILE pointing to json file with configSee example in samples/example/gcfg.json ```export GUNICORN_CONFIG_FILE =&quot;./gcfg.json&quot;```To build, install, and run runtime changes without the use of the `run-sample` rule, the below steps can be used for same result:```&gt; python setup.py build &amp;&amp; python setup.py install&gt; cd samples/example&gt; python setup.py build &amp;&amp; python setup.py install&gt; ./bin/icon_example http```### Testing Locally with Docker RuntimeIn addition to testing locally with the resulting runtime and an InsightConnect plugin, it is also possible to build a plugin locally and test it as it would be used by the InsightConnect orchestrator.First, build the base runtime:```make build-image```This will result in tagged Docker images that can be used in the included sample plugins. Then the plugin can be built and run locally:```&gt; cd samples/example&gt; icon-plugin build image --no-pull&gt; docker run -it -p 10001:10001 rapid7/example:latest http```## Running TestsIn order to run tests, first ensure `tox` has been installed. Tox makes it easy for testing this project in isolated virtual environments and for specific Python versions. To install tox:```&gt; pip install tox```Running all tests:```&gt; tox```Running a specific test file:```&gt; tox -e py38 -- tests/plugin/hello_world/tests/test_cli.py```## ReleaseTo release a new version of the InsightConnect Python Plugin Runtime, the below steps must be followed:1. Make sure that version is updated in changelog, and `setup.py` file. 2. Create a Pull Request with your changes to be merged into master3. Merge changes after receiving at least one approval4. Create a versioned tag off of release; version must follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/); using the `git tag [version #]` command (not through the GitHub release UI!) then `git push origin --tags`.5. [Github Action](https://github.com/rapid7/komand-plugin-sdk-python/actions) will perform a matrix build and release based on the recently created tag for each Python version and Dockerfile in scope## ContributionsContributions for maintaining and enhancing the InsightConnect Python Plugin Runtime are appreciated. This project uses[Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for code formatting and includes a pre-commit hook to auto format code as it iscontributed. Black is installed as a test dependency and the hook can be initialized by running `pre-commit install` after cloning this repository.## Changelog* 5.0.0 - Add `has_more_pages` property to task output to indicate task pagination status to output consumers* 4.10.1 - Remove raising of exception if request id is not available in header* 4.10.0 - Add structlog for structured logging* 4.9.0 - Add current SDK version plugin is using to /info endpoint* 4.8.0 - Add `OAuth20ClientCredentialMixin` class to clients* 4.7.6 - Add `PaginationHelper` to the AWS Client | Refactored the `ActionHelper` | Add `region` handler for AWSAction * 4.7.5 - Add AWS client for assuming role * 4.7.4 - Convert data field to string in exception handling * 4.7.3 - Add `measurement_time` property to plugin metrics collection* 4.7.2 - Fix incorrect status codes when handling PluginExceptions* 4.7.1 - Fix new connection test endpoint, version pin requests to 2.26.0* 4.7.0 - Add endpoint for retrieving all action definitions (input schemas for all actions within a plugin)* 4.6.0 - Add Bad Response preset to PluginException | Improve 400 error exception handling* 4.5.1 - Bump version number for release pipeline* 4.5.0 - Improve exception handling for non-ConnectionTestException errors during a connection test* 4.4.0 - Add initial support for plugin runtime metrics collection* 4.3.3 - Constrain greenlet dependency version to fix conflict with gevent* 4.3.2 - Update Flask dependency to version 2.0.3* 4.3.1 - Add Timeout Preset to ConnectionTestException* 4.2.1 - Add helpful error messages in JSON* 4.2.0 - Add implementation and endpoints for tasks* 4.1.1 - Update gevent dependency version to 20.9.0* 4.1.0 - Provide ability to run with gevent asynchronous gunicorn worker class for increased performance* 4.0.3 - Fix to avoid command injections when using exec_command helper method* 4.0.2 - Fix to remove unprintable characters from trigger logs* 4.0.1 - Fix bug by including schema files in manifest | Fix issue uploading python library twice to PYPI* 4.0.0 - Implement new API endpoints |  Implement Swagger API documentation generation |  End support for Python2 and PyPy |  Add development details to README | Enhancements to Makefile for local development and release |  Rebrand SDK to InsightConnect Python Plugin Runtime |  Revamp release process with use of Github Actions* 3.3.0 - Add webserver route to allow for threading changes* 3.2.0 - Add new ConnectionTestException/PluginException presets: UNKNOWN, BASE64_ENCODE, BASE64_DECODE, INVALID_JSON | Add an optional data parameter for formatting response output</longdescription>

	<longdescription>PYTHON DEEPOPS MODULE=====================This module contains some functions for performing &quot;deep&quot; operations onstandard Python &quot;compound&quot; data structures - lists/sets/dictionaries:* `deepmerge()` - merges two compound structures, including all sub-items,  e.g. items to lists and sets, missing keys/items to dictionaries, optionally  replacing clashing simple types.* `deepremoveitems()` - removes items (simple types, or whole compound  structures) from within another compound data structure.* `deepfilter()` - returns the part of one compound structure that is matched  by the other: essentially the opposite of deepremoveitems().* `deepdiff()` - compares two compound structures and returns a tuple of items  to be removed and items to be updated: these could be passed to  `deepremoveitems()` and `deepmerge()`, respectively, to transform one into  the other (although note that they would need to be `deepcopy()`ed first).* `deepsetdefault()` - similar to dict.setdefault() except that it can set the  default at arbitrarily deep paths into a dictionary.* `deepget()` - similar to dict.get() but can copy with arbitrarily deep paths  into an indexable structure.The module was developed and used under Python 3.4-3.7 but seems towork OK in basic testing under 2.7.Author------Robert Franklin &lt;rcf@mince.net&gt;, UK</longdescription>

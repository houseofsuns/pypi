	<longdescription>Powerline=========[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PH111P/powerline.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/PH111P/powerline)[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/powerline-i3/badge/?version=latest)](http://powerline-i3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)This is a fork of Kim Silkebækken's (kim.silkebaekken+vim@gmail.com) powerline(https://github.com/powerline/powerline).**Powerline is a statusline plugin for vim, and provides statuslines andprompts for several other applications, including zsh, bash, tmux, IPython,Awesome, i3 and Qtile. However, this fork is designed to be used in particularas a replacement for i3's i3bar.**Features--------For general features, consult the documentation. These arethe features that were added in this fork.* List all workspaces, _and icons of applications currently running on a workspace (using FontAwesome)_* More multi-monitor options for the workspace segment.* Enhanced battery segment, having the same features as the i3bar one. Further, this segment  now works with multiple batteries.* Enhanced wifi segment to match i3bar's.* Added a NetworkManager segment based on `nmcli`* Added a Bluetooth segment using `dbus` and `Bluez`* Added a volume segment.* Added GPMDP support in the player segment.* Merged and improved [ZyX-I's revinfo branch](https://github.com/ZyX-I/powerline/tree/revinfo), replacing the VCS segment.* Added an auto-rotate segment (currently only works under X).* Added a vi-mode segment and corresponding mode support for ipython ≥ 7.0.0 * Click support (see documentation below)* Simplified gradients: specify start and end colors (and optionally intermediate colors) as hex values, values in-between colors (and corresponding cterm colors) will be generated automatically.* Support for global menusChanges requiring documentation-------------------------------This fork extends the files used by the powerline to configure the color scheme in various ways:* `attrs` is now optional, i.e., it can be omitted* `click` is a new optional field to configure the behavior of a highlight group on a click. Where `click` is a dictionary mapping the values `left`, `right`, `middle`, `scroll up` or `scroll down` to a string to be executed by a shell. (Currently only the lemonbar binding supports this. You can disable clicks via the `no_clicks` flag.) Further, the string to be executed may contain a placeholder for the segment's content. This placeholder uses python's `string.format` syntax. You may also pass some special commands to the bar/to specific segments directly via special bar commands starting with `#bar;`.* You may pass an `alt_output` flag to `powerline-lemonbar`, then it uses the `-O` flag for setting the output for the bar.* The colors in `fg` and `bg` can be specified directly through hex values using `0x` as a prefix (`0xRRGGBB` or `0xAARRGGBB`). These hex values will be translated back into xterm color indices whenever possible.* The bar has an additional `center` region where segments may be placed. The center region uses pipes (`|`) as separators per default.* The `active_window_title` segment includes optional functionality for global menus. Consult the section below for details on the required configuration.Examples--------A configuration to let the workspace segment act like the i3bar's (`workspace_name` is a special value that gets set to the correct workspace name by the workspace segment.):      &quot;workspace&quot;: { &quot;fg&quot;: &quot;0xe4e4e4&quot;, &quot;bg&quot;: &quot;0x0087af&quot;, &quot;click&quot;: { &quot;left&quot;: &quot;i3-msg workspace {workspace_name}&quot;, &quot;right&quot;: &quot;i3-msg move to workspace {workspace_name}&quot; } },      &quot;workspace:urgent&quot;: { &quot;bg&quot;: &quot;0x0087af&quot;, &quot;fg&quot;: &quot;0xffaf00&quot;, &quot;click&quot;: { &quot;left&quot;: &quot;i3-msg workspace {workspace_name}&quot;, &quot;right&quot;: &quot;i3-msg move to workspace {workspace_name}&quot; } },A handy configuration of the volume segment:      &quot;volume_gradient&quot;: { &quot;fg&quot;: &quot;green_yellow_red&quot;, &quot;bg&quot;: &quot;0x005f87&quot;, &quot;click&quot;: { &quot;scroll up&quot;: &quot;pactl set-sink-volume 0 +1%&quot;, &quot;scroll down&quot;: &quot;pactl set-sink-volume 0 -1%&quot;} },Note that the `lemonbar` allows for only a fixed number of clickable areas, which has to be specified as an argument (via `-a`).Installation------------This fork is available from the AUR (`powerline-i3-git`).Alternatively, you may use `pip` for the installation:pip install git+https://github.com/PH111P/powerline.git@developNote that using this fork (or the powerline in general) requires some additional packages to be installed,namely:* [powerline-fonts](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/powerline-fonts/)* [ttf-font-awesome-4](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ttf-font-awesome-4/) (Version 5 relocated some symbols)* i3 or i3-gaps* [lemonbar-clicks-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lemonbar-clicks-git/) ([Lemonbar](https://github.com/ph111p/bar) supporting fontconfig fonts)* [python-xlib](https://github.com/python-xlib/python-xlib)* [i3ipc-python-git](https://github.com/acrisci/i3ipc-python) (workspace segment, available from AUR)Optionally, the following packages should be installed if you want to use the corresponding segments.* nmcli (NetworkManager segment)* python-iwlib (wifi segment)* python-pyalsaaudio (volume segment, available from AUR)* xorg-xinput (screen rotation segment, used to map input devices to outputs)* python-google-api-python-client (Google Calendar segment; this segment also requires a valid dev key to work)* python-psutil (cpu load segment)* python-pygit2 (better performance of the vcs segment)* appmenu-qt4 (global menu support in qt4 apps)* appmenu-qt5 (global menu support in qt5 apps)* appmenu-gtk-module-git (global menu support in gtk apps)* libdbusmenu-glib (global menu support for chrome/chromium)* libdbusmenu-gtk3 (global menu support for chrome/chromium)* libdbusmenu-gtk2 (global menu support for chrome/chromium)* pygtk (global menu support)* python-gobject (global menu support)To actually _use_ the powerline in your i3 setup, replace the following lines in your `.config/i3/config`      bar {          status_command i3status      }with this line (you may want to adjust the height and the font size):      exec &quot;powerline-lemonbar --height 16 -- -b -f 'DejaVu Sans Mono-11' -f 'PowerlineSymbols-12' -f 'FontAwesome-11'&quot;Note that ``Font Awesome`` is used to display some icons, thus changing it to some other font will likely break these icons.**Attention: `-f 'PowerlineSymbols-12'` is required if you have the non-git version of the powerline-fonts package installed. If you have the git version of that package installed (from the AUR), use `-f 'DejaVu Sans Mono for Powerline-11'` instead.**To use global menus in the bar, also start the `powerline-globmenu` script at startup.Further, add the following to your `.bashrc`:    if [ -n &quot;$GTK_MODULES&quot; ]; then        GTK_MODULES=&quot;${GTK_MODULES}:appmenu-gtk-module&quot;    else        GTK_MODULES=&quot;appmenu-gtk-module&quot;    fi    if [ -z &quot;$UBUNTU_MENUPROXY&quot; ]; then        UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=1    fi    export GTK_MODULES    export UBUNTU_MENUPROXYConsult the `global_menu` default theme on how to configure the `active_window_title` segment.Configuration-------------Basic powerline configuration is done via `JSON` files located at `.config/powerline/`. It is a good idea to start by copying the default configuration located at `powerline_root/powerline/config_files/` to `.config/powerline/`.If you installed the powerline from the AUR or via pip, `powerline_root` should be `/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/` or something similar, depending on your python version.This should yield you the following directory structure:```.config/powerline/├── colorschemes│   ├── ...│   └── wm|       └── default.json  // Your configuration goes here├── colors.json├── config.json└── themes    ├── ...    └── wm        └── default.json  // Your configuration goes here```The files in the subdirectories of `themes` are used to specify which segments shall be shown; the files in subdirectories of `colorschemes` are used to specify which colors (as defined in `colors.json`) shall be used to display a segment.Note that your local configuration only overrides the global configuration, it does not replace it, i.e. if you don't configure something locally, the global default will be used instead.Consult the [documentation](https://powerline-i3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#quick-setup-guide) for more details. See also the [segment reference](https://powerline-i3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/segments.html) for available segments and their configuration.Some screens------------Some big, blue, beautiful powerlines.![Everything](https://github.com/PH111P/powerline/blob/develop/docs/source/_static/img/pl-i3demo1.png)![Modes](https://github.com/PH111P/powerline/blob/develop/docs/source/_static/img/pl-i3demo2.png)This is as far as it could get. However, this is a rare use case.![Full](https://github.com/PH111P/powerline/blob/develop/docs/source/_static/img/pl-i3demo3.png)</longdescription>

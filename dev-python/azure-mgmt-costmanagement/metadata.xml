	<longdescription>## Microsoft Azure SDK for PythonThis is the Microsoft Azure Cost Management Client Library.Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is the next generation of management APIsthat replace the old Azure Service Management (ASM).This package has been tested with Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7.For the older Azure Service Management (ASM) libraries, see[azure-servicemanagement-legacy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure-servicemanagement-legacy)library.For a more complete set of Azure libraries, see the[azure sdk python release](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/all).# UsageTo learn how to use this package, see the [quickstart guide](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt)For docs and references, see [Python SDK References](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/)Code samples for this package can be found at [Costmanagement Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/browse/?languages=python&amp;term=Getting%20started%20-%20Managing&amp;terms=Getting%20started%20-%20Managing) on docs.microsoft.com.Additional code samples for different Azure services are available at [Samples Repo](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt/samples)## Provide FeedbackIf you encounter any bugs or have suggestions, please file an issue inthe [Issues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues)section of the project.![image](https://azure-sdk-impressions.azurewebsites.net/api/impressions/azure-sdk-for-python%2Fazure-mgmt-costmanagement%2FREADME.png)# Release History## 3.0.0 (2021-07-27)**Breaking changes**  - Parameter dataset of model QueryDefinition is now required  - Parameter dataset of model ForecastDefinition is now required## 2.0.0 (2021-06-08)**Features**  - Model QueryResult has a new parameter sku  - Model QueryResult has a new parameter e_tag  - Model QueryResult has a new parameter location  - Model View has a new parameter date_range  - Model View has a new parameter data_set  - Model View has a new parameter include_monetary_commitment  - Model View has a new parameter currency  - Model ExportExecution has a new parameter tags  - Added operation group GenerateReservationDetailsReportOperations  - Added operation group SettingsOperations**Breaking changes**  - Parameter recurrence of model ExportSchedule is now required  - Operation ExportsOperations.list has a new signature  - Operation ExportsOperations.get has a new signature  - Model Export no longer has parameter run_history  - Model Export no longer has parameter next_run_time_estimate  - Model View no longer has parameter dataset  - Model ExportExecution no longer has parameter e_tag  - Model ExportExecution no longer has parameter error  - Model CommonExportProperties no longer has parameter run_history  - Model CommonExportProperties no longer has parameter next_run_time_estimate  - Model ExportProperties no longer has parameter run_history  - Model ExportProperties no longer has parameter next_run_time_estimate  - Model QueryFilter has a new signature  - Model ReportConfigFilter has a new signature## 1.0.0 (2021-02-04)**Features**  - Model ExportExecution has a new parameter e_tag**Breaking changes**  - Model ExportExecution no longer has parameter tags## 1.0.0b1 (2020-12-09)This is beta preview version.This version uses a next-generation code generator that introduces important breaking changes, but also important new features (like unified authentication and async programming).**General breaking changes**- Credential system has been completly revamped:  - `azure.common.credentials` or `msrestazure.azure_active_directory` instances are no longer supported, use the `azure-identity` classes instead: https://pypi.org/project/azure-identity/  - `credentials` parameter has been renamed `credential`- The `config` attribute no longer exists on a client, configuration should be passed as kwarg. Example: `MyClient(credential, subscription_id, enable_logging=True)`. For a complete set of  supported options, see the [parameters accept in init documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#available-policies)- You can't import a `version` module anymore, use `__version__` instead- Operations that used to return a `msrest.polling.LROPoller` now returns a `azure.core.polling.LROPoller` and are prefixed with `begin_`.- Exceptions tree have been simplified and most exceptions are now `azure.core.exceptions.HttpResponseError` (`CloudError` has been removed).- Most of the operation kwarg have changed. Some of the most noticeable:  - `raw` has been removed. Equivalent feature can be found using `cls`, a callback that will give access to internal HTTP response for advanced user  - For a complete set of  supported options, see the [parameters accept in Request documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#available-policies)## 0.2.0 (2020-04-08)**Features**  - Added operation DimensionsOperations.list  - Added operation QueryOperations.usage**Breaking changes**  - Model QueryDataset no longer has parameter sorting  - Removed operation DimensionsOperations.list_by_subscription  - Removed operation QueryOperations.usage_by_scope**General Breaking Changes**This version uses a next-generation code generator that *might*introduce breaking changes. In summary, some modules were incorrectlyvisible/importable and have been renamed. This fixed several issuescaused by usage of classes that were not supposed to be used in thefirst place.  - CostManagementClient cannot be imported from    `azure.mgmt.costmanagement.cost_management_client` anymore (import from    `azure.mgmt.costmanagement` works like before)  - CostManagementClientConfiguration import has been moved from    `azure.mgmt.costmanagement.cost_management_client` to `azure.mgmt.costmanagement`  - A model `MyClass` from a &quot;models&quot; sub-module cannot be imported    anymore using `azure.mgmt.costmanagement.models.my_class` (import from    `azure.mgmt.costmanagement.models` works like before)  - An operation class `MyClassOperations` from an `operations`    sub-module cannot be imported anymore using    `azure.mgmt.costmanagement.operations.my_class_operations` (import from    `azure.mgmt.costmanagement.operations` works like before)Last but not least, HTTP connection pooling is now enabled by default.You should always use a client as a context manager, or call close(), oruse no more than one client per process.## 0.1.0 (2019-05-04)  - Initial Release</longdescription>

	<longdescription># ACT types## IntroductionThese scripts are used to add types to the [ACT](https://github.com/mnemonic-no/act-platform) data model (object types and fact types).## Installation1. This project requires that you have a running installation of the [act-platform](https://github.com/mnemonic-no/act-platform).2. Install from pip```bashpip install act-types```## Breaking changes### 2.0 Updated data modelThis version includes breaking changes to the data model. It is advised to do a reimport of all data and import using act-worker with version &gt;= 2.0.0.The following changes are implemented:- act-types and act-graph-datamodel is moved to act-admin and act-utils.# Local developmentUse pip to install in [local development mode](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs). act-types (and act-api) uses namespacing, so it is not compatible with using `setup.py install` or `setup.py develop`.In repository, run:```bashpip3 install --user -e .```It is also necessary to install in local development mode to correctly resolve the files that are read by the `--default-*` options when doing local changes. These are read from etc under act.types and if the package is installed with &quot;pip install act-types&quot; it will always read the files from the installed package, even though you do changes in a local checked out repository.</longdescription>

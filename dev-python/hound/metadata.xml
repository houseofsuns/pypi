	<longdescription># HoundA FireCloud database extension## PurposeThis repository contains the source code for the Hound database extension system.This system aims to provide a low-latency system for logging changes to a FireCloudworkspace.This allows for attribute provenance to be reconstructed by querying the databasehistory, and for external tools to log changes as well.## Usage1) Users with hound-enabled software automatically generate logs as they continueto do their work2) Hound can recreate attribute value histories from logs to produce provenance## FormatHound logs data in a bucket folder. Entries are organized based on the list below.`snowflake` refers to an auto-generated ID from Hound's snowflake implementation.Snowflakes are almost guaranteed to be unique (see below)* hound/: Root folder for hound data in bucket  * (samples|pairs|participants|sets)/: Folder for entity-metadata change logs    * (entity-id)/: Folder for entity data      * (attribute)/: Folder for attribute data on each entity        * (snowflake): Serial numbered files containing **update objects**  * workspace/: Folder for workspace-level metadata    * (attribute)/: Folder for attribute data on the workspace      * (snowflake): Serial numbered files containing **update objects**  * logs/: Folder for event-logs    * (job|upload|meta|other)/: Folder for specific event entries      * (snowflake): Files containing **log entries**### Snowflake specEncode 22-byte snowflake into 44 byte (hex encoded) object name* 64-bit (8 byte) unix timestamp (8 byte floating-point number)* 64-bit (8 byte) machine id (based on nodename) Only 6 bytes used* 16-bit (2 byte) random client id (generated during init of Snowflake object)* 16-bit (2 byte) sequence identifier (starts at 0 per client, increments from there)* 8-bit (1 byte) Zero field (reserved)* 8-bit (1 byte) checksum field (sum of remaining fields)#### UniquenessSnowflakes are structured to almost guarantee uniqueness. If two clients from thesame machine (or from machines with identical MAC addresses) create a snowflakeat **exactly** the same time (within their system clocks' precisions) **AND** theclients have generated the same number of snowflakes so far (clients have the same  sequence id), there is a 1/65536 chance that the snowflakes will collide (based on  client id).</longdescription>

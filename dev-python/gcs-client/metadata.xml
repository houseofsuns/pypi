Recommended credentials file is JSON.Once you have the credentials you can start using gcs_client to access your project:.. code-block:: python    import gcs_client    credentials = gcs_client.Credentials('private_key.json')    project = gcs_client.Project('project_name', credentials)    # Print buckets in the project    buckets = project.list()    print 'Buckets:\n\t-', '\n\t- '.join(map(str, buckets))    # Print some information from first bucket    bucket = buckets[0]    print 'Bucket %s is located in %s with storage class %s' % (bucket, bucket.location,                                                                bucket.storageClass)    # List the objects in the bucket    objects = bucket.list()    if not objects:        print 'There are no objects, creating one'        filename = '/tmp/my_file.txt'        with bucket.open(filename, 'w') as f:            f.write('this is a test file\n' * 100)        objects = [gcs_client.Object(bucket.name, filename, credentials=credentials)]    if objects:        print '\t', '\n\t'.join(map(lambda o: o.name + ' has %s bytes' % o.size, objects))        # Read the contents from the first file        with objects[0].open() as obj:            print 'Contents of file %s are:\n' % obj.name, obj.read()    else:        print 'There are no objects, nothing to do'More examples can be found in the documentation, in the Usage section.Reporting an issue------------------If you've found an issue with gcs-client here's how you can report the problem:- Preferred method is filing a bug on GitHub:  1. Go to project's `issue tracker on GitHub`_  2. Search for existing issues using the search field at the top of the page  3. File a new issue with information on the problem  4. Thanks for helping make gcs-client better- If you don't have a GitHub account and don't wish to create one you can just  drop me an email... _Google's appengine-gcs-client: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/appengine-gcs-client.. _Google: https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/overview.. _Google Developers Console: https://console.developers.google.com.. _Credentials section: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials.. _issue tracker on GitHub: https://github.com/Akrog/gcs-client/issues=======History=======0.2.2 (2016-11-26)------------------* Fix #1 - Media upload not working0.2.1 (2016-03-26)------------------* Fix requirements issue0.2.0 (2015-11-25)------------------* Add support for delimiter in listings using Prefix object* Remove dependency from google-api-python-client* Return descriptive error message on AttributeError0.1.4 (2015-11-16)------------------* No changes, version bump to reload in pypi0.1.3 (2015-11-16)------------------* Reading an object will return data as bytes, not a bytearray.* Read specific versions of an object.* Can specify chunksize on Bucket's open and Object init.* Add exists to buckets and project.* Fix opening files with names that needed encoding.0.1.2 (2015-11-10)------------------* Fix seek method.0.1.1 (2015-11-09)------------------* Fix Pypi package.0.1.0 (2015-11-09)------------------* First release on PyPI.</longdescription>

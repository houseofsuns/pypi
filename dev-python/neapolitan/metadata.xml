	<longdescription>==========Neapolitan==========I have a Django model:.. code:: python    from django.db import models    class Bookmark(models.Model):        url = models.URLField(unique=True)        title = models.CharField(max_length=255)        note = models.TextField(blank=True)        favourite = models.BooleanField(default=False)I want easy CRUD views for it, without it taking all day:.. code:: python    # urls.py    from neapolitan.views import CRUDView    class BookmarkView(CRUDView):        model = Bookmark        fields = [&quot;url&quot;, &quot;title&quot;, &quot;note&quot;]        filterset_fields = [            &quot;favourite&quot;,        ]    urlpatterns = [ ... ] + BookmarkView.get_urls()Neapolitan's ``CRUDView`` provides the standard list, detail,create, edit, and delete views for a model, as well as the hooks you need tobe able to customise any part of that.Neapolitan provides base templates and re-usable template tags to make gettingyour model on the page as easy as possible.Where you take your app after that is up to you. But Neapolitan will get youstarted.Let's go! 🚀Next stop `the docs &lt;https://noumenal.es/neapolitan/&gt;`_ 🚂Versioning and Status---------------------Neapolitan uses a two-part CalVer versioning scheme, such as ``23.7``. The firstnumber is the year. The second is the release number within that year.This is alpha software. I'm still working out the details of the API, and I'veonly begun the docs.**But**: You could just read ``neapolitan.views.CRUDView`` and see what it does.Up to you. 😜Installation------------Install with pip:.. code:: bash    pip install neapolitanAdd ``neapolitan`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``:.. code:: python    INSTALLED_APPS = [        ...        &quot;neapolitan&quot;,    ]Templates expect a ``base.html`` template to exist and for that to defined a``content`` block.

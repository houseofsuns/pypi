It also serves as a fairly minimal example of setting up a package that [pip][] caninstall, and specifying dependencies.In particular, I structure it for the following use-cases:1. Rapid installation and configuration of the tools I need. For example, I often use   [CoCalc][]. Whenever I create a new project, I need to perform some   initialization. With this project, it is simply a matter of using [pipx][] to install   this package, and then using some of the tools. Specifically:    ```bash    pipx install mmf-setup    mmf_setup cocalc mercurial hg-evolve hg-git black    ```        This does the following, and then links various configuration files to the home    directory:        ```bash    pipx install mmf-setup    pipx inject mmf-setup mercurial hg-evolve hg-git black    curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -    ```2.  Initial setup of a python distribution on a new computer. This is a little more    involved since one needs to first install python (I recommend using    [Miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html)) and then updating the tools.3.  A place to document various aspects of installing and setting up python and related    tools. Some of this is old, but kept here for reference.4.  A generic way of setting `sys.path` for development work using the following (in order    of decreasing precedence) by calling `mmf_setup.set_path()`.    - An entry in a `pyproject.toml` file somewhere in a higher-level directory.    - An entry in a `setup.cfg` file somewhere in a higher-level directory.    - The first parent directory with either of these files, a `setup.py` file, or `.hg`      or `.git` directories.Quickstart (TL;DR)==================1.  To get the notebook initialization features without having to install the package,    just copy [nbinit.py](nbinit.py) to your project. Importing this will try to execute    `import mmf_setup;mmf_setup.nbinit()` but failing this, will manually run a similar    code.2.  Install this package from the source directory,    [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi), etc. with one of the following:    - **Directly from PyPI**        ```bash        python3 -m pip install --user mmf-setup[nbextensions]        ```    - **From Source**        ```bash        python3 -m pip install --user        hg+https://alum.mit.edu/www/mforbes/hg/forbes-group/mmf-setup[nbextensions]        ```    - **From Local Source** *(Run this from the source directory after you unpack it.)*        ```bash        python3 -m pip install --user .[nbextensions]        ```    Note: these includes the `nbextensions` extra. You and run without the `--user` flag    if you want to install them system-wide rather than into [`site.USER_BASE`][].3.  To get the notebook tools for Jupyter (IPython) notebooks, execute the following as    a code cell in your notebook and then trust the notebook with `File/Trust Notebook`:    ```python    import mmf_setup; mmf_setup.nbinit()    ```    This will set the theme which is implemented in the output cell so it is stored for    use online such as when rendered through    [NBViewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org). One can specify different    themes. (Presently only `theme='default'` and `theme='mmf'` are supported.)4.  **Mercurial:** If you want to install mercurial with the [hg-git][] and [Evolve][]    extensions, then you can do that with the `hg` extra:    ```bash    python3 -m pip install --user .[hg]    ```    This essentially runs `pip install mercurial hg-git hg-evolve`.  You can then enable    these in your environment by sourcing the `mmf_setup` script in one of the following    ways:    ```bash    eval $&quot;(mmf_setup -v)&quot;     # Enable hg lg but not evolve, etc.    eval $&quot;(mmf_setup -v -H)&quot;  # Enable evolve, etc.    mmf_setup -v [-H]          # Shows what will be set set (dry run).    ```    To do this automatically when you login, add this line to your `~/.bashc` or    `~/.bash_profile` scripts.        &gt; **Warning:** the `eval $&quot;(mmf_setup -v -H)&quot;` option also includes a mercurial    &gt; update hook which will add `%include ../.hgrc` to your projects `.hg/hgrc` file    &gt; upon `hg &gt; update`.  This allows you to include project-specific mercurial    &gt; customizations in your repository, but is a potential security risk.  See the    &gt; discussion below.    These can also be enabled manually by adding the following to your `~/.hgrc` file:    ```ini    # ~/.hgrc    ...    [extensions]    evolve =    topics =    hggit =    ```Setting `sys.path`==================The preferred way to work with python code is to install it, preferably into a virtualenvironment or a conda environment. By installing it, you will assure that your programor library is available to notebooks, etc.  by being properly inserted intosys.path. When developing, code, one can also do a [&quot;editable&quot;installs](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#local-project-installs)with `python -m install -e \&lt;path\&gt;` so that code updates are seen.When developing code, however, this may not meet all use-cases, so we provide`mmf_utils.set_path(cwd='.')` which will set `mmf_setup.ROOT` and insert it at the startof `sys.path`. The algorithm for determining `ROOT` is as follows starting from `cwd` (which is `'.'`by default, but can be specified in the call to `set_path()`).  Note: in each case, thespecified path must be an existing directory or it will be ignored.* A value specified as `mmf_setup.ROOT` will override everything.* A value in the environmental variable `MMF_SETUP_ROOT` will override everything else.* An explicit `ROOT` entry in the first `pyproject.toml` found:        ```toml    # pyproject.toml    [tool.mmf_setup]    ROOT = 'src'    ```* An explict entry in the first `setup.cfg`:        ```ini    # setup.cfg    [mmf_setup]    ROOT = src    ```* The first parent directory to contain any of the files `setup.py`, `setup.cfg`, or  `pyproject.toml`, or directories `.git`, or `.hg`.If none of these yields a valid existing directory for `ROOT`, then it will not be set.Mercurial (hg) Tools====================If you source the output of the `mmf_setup` script with one of the following:```basheval $&quot;(mmf_setup -v)&quot;eval $&quot;(mmf_setup -v -H)&quot;```then your `HGRCPATH` will be amended to include[`hgrc.lga`](src/mmf_setup/_data/hgrc.lga) or[`hgrc.full`](src/mmf_setup/_data/hgrc.full) respectively.  The first adds a useful `hglga` (`hg lg` for short) command which provides a concise graphical display:```bash$ hg lg@  200:d michael (64 minutes ago) 0.4.0[0.4.0] tip|   ENH,DOC,TST,API: Cleaned up set_path...o  199:d michael (31 hours ago) 0.4.0[0.4.0]|   WIP,CHK: Cleaning up set_path.o  198:d michael (20 hours ago) 0.4.0[0.4.0]|   DOC: Added developer Notes.md...```The second version with `-H` adds some useful extensions: [hg-git][], [Evolve][], andenables [Topics][].  The latter are required, for example, to interface with[Heptapod](https://octobus.net/blog/2019-09-04-heptapod-workflow.html).Finally, the `-H` option enables an `hg update` hook, which adds `%include ../.hgrc` toyour project's `.hg/hgrc` file when you call `hg update`.  This is a potential securityrisk, because an untrusted repo could include dangerous commands in `.hgrc`.  Thus, werequire user intervention before including this:```bash$ eval $&quot;(mmf_setup -v -H)&quot;$ hg clone https://alum.mit.edu/www/mforbes/hg/forbes-group/mmf-setup...updating to branch default88 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved$ cd mmf-setup$ hg up 0.4.0Repository .../mmf-setup contains an .hgrc file.Including this in .hg/hgrc is a potential security risk.Only do this if you trust the repository.Include this .hgrc in .hg/hgrc? [yN]yAdding '%include ../.hgrc' to '.hg/hgrc'...$ tail .hg/hgrc...%include ../.hgrc```CoCalc======We provide some tools for working on [CoCalc][].  To get started, simply do to thefollowing once you have enabled network access on your project by applying a license:```bashpipx install mmf-setupmmf_setup cocalc```To see exactly what this will do, run:```bashmmf_setup cocalc -v```Once this is done, you should ensure that, whenever you use a terminal on [CoCalc][],you appropriately set the following variables:* `LC_HG_USERNAME`: Used by [mercurial][].* `LC_GIT_USEREMAIL`, `LC_GIT_USERNAME`: Used by [git][].These will identify you as you when you commit your work.  (Needed, because all usersshare the same project.  See [cocalc#370][] for details.)[cocalc#370]: &lt;https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc/issues/370&gt;I recommend the following:1. Forward these variables in your SSH config file (`~/.ssh/config`):    ```    # ~/.ssh/config    Host cc-project1      User ff1cb986f...        Host cc*      HostName ssh.cocalc.com      ForwardAgent yes      SetEnv LC_HG_USERNAME=Your Full Name &lt;your.email.address+hg@gmail.com&gt;      SetEnv LC_GIT_USERNAME=Your Full Name      SetEnv LC_GIT_USEREMAIL=your.email.address+git@gmail.com      SetEnv LC_EDITOR=vi    ```        The appropriate value for `User` can be found in the project Settings on [CoCalc][].        Optionally, use `SendEnv ...` and set these on your personal computer:    ```bash    # ~/.bashrc or similar    LC_HG_USERNAME=Your Full Name &lt;your.email.address+hg@gmail.com&gt;    LC_GIT_USEREMAIL=your.email.address+git@gmail.com    LC_GIT_USERNAME=Your Full Name    ```2. If you want to run [Git][] or [Mercurial][] from the [CoCalc][] web interface, then   create a named terminal -- i.e. `Michael.term` -- and then set these variables in the   terminal startup script.  (See https://doc.cocalc.com/terminal.html#startup-files for   details.)   [CoCalc]: &lt;cocalc.com&gt;# NotesSee [Notes.md](Notes.md) for developer notes.

[CoCalc issue #6210]: &lt;https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc/issues/6210&gt;## 0.4.8- Don't install mercurial etc. on CoCalc by default: these are now included in the  Default Ubuntu 20.04 image.  If you need these, then explicitly specify them:    ```bash  mmf-setup cocalc mercurial hg-git hg-evolve jupytext black  ```  ## 0.4.7- Recommend and support installing mmf-setup with pipx on CoCalc.- Use new Poetry install.- Drop support for python3.6.## 0.4.6- Use python3 for CoCalc setup.  (Is a problem on Docker images).- Ignore matplotlib errors.## 0.4.3- Resolves issue #28: Failure of `mmf_initial_setup` on Mac OS X if .DS_Store files exist.- Resolves issue #29: Relative paths in config files resolve to absolute paths- Added aliases `findpy`, `findf`, `finda` etc. for CoCalc for running `find` + `grep`.## 0.4.2- Resolves issue #26: Significant improvements for installation on CoCalc.  - Moves `~/.bashrc` to `~/.bashrc_cocalc` so we can insert `~/.local/bin` to the    `PATH` for non-login shells.  This is important when trying to push with `hg` over    SSH, which runs `hg` without logging in.  Our new workflow needs that `hg` to have    access to `evolve` etc.   Previously this worked by updating these with the system    `Python 2` version of `hg`, but that now fails with new projects, so we have removed    this.  - Add `.hgrc` tweaks to top-level cocalc `~.hgrc` (might as well include `hgrc.lga`    here now so students etc. can see these.  Don't enable `evolve` etc. by default    though.)  - Users should now call `eval &quot;$(mmf_setup -v -H)&quot;` rather than using source    `. mmf_setup -H`.  Sourcing `mmf_setup` now emits a deprecation warning message.  - Cocalc install is now tested in an isolated manner.  (Only the `nox -s test_cocalc`    works... see issue #27.)- Make `hgrc.full` POSIX compliant (work with `sh`).  (Was causing GitHub workflow to  fail.)  Scripts still require `bash` which is explicitly chosen when we call  `run-tests.py`.- Working GitHub workflows and cocalc tests.- Updated release process.## 0.4.1- Make `mmf_setup -v` output clean so that we can `eval &quot;$(mmf_setup -v)&quot;` rather than  sourcing. *In the future we will make this a python file, so `eval` will be the only  option.*- Fixed issues with `nbinit()` failing with not paths defined.- Added more tests.## 0.4.0- Resolves issue #23: Drop support of nbclean mercurial extension (to hard to  maintain), thereby making issues #1, #3, #8, #9, #11, obsolete.- Remove installation of old obsolete notebook extensions like Calico tools,  [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) etc. These can all be  installed now with either the standard extensions, or pip.     * With pip:            ```bash        python -m pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions RISE        jupyter contrib nbextension install --user        ```           * With conda:        ```bash        conda install -c conda-forge jupyter_contrib_nbextensions rise        jupyter contrib nbextension install --user        ```  See also  [NBExtensions](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions).  - Improved test isolation.- Expanded options for `mmf_setup`.    - Mercurial configuration is now in two stages: `hgrc.lga` which gives the `hg lg`      command safely using only builtin modules, and `hgrc.full` which includes this,      and also activates the `hg-git` and `evolve` extensions.  This also applies the      `update` hook for including `.hgrc` files, but asks the user for confirmation      because this is a security risk.    ## 0.3.1- Added `mmf_setup cocalc` initialization for CoCalc.com projects  (changed from `mmf_setup smc`).- Add message to `nbinit()` call indicating that HGROOT has been added  to `sys.path`.- Resolves issue #22 with git username classes on CoCalc. ## 0.3.0- Support python 3 - drop support for python 2.- Conda installable from mforbes channel on anaconda cloud.- Add missing default.tex theme so that nbinit() brings in math definitions even if no  theme is specified.- Fixed KeyError: `asyncio` error on failed IPython import.## 0.1.13- Incomplete version... everything here is rolled into 0.3.0## 0.1.12- Made `mmf_initial_setup` python 3 compliant.- Added logging to `nbinit()` and made some slight tweaks to `HGROOT`.- Added `\D`, `\sn`, `\cn`, `\dn` commands for MathJaX.## 0.1.11- Resolve issue #20:    - `mmf_setup.set_path.set_path_from_file` allows for configuration of path in      `setup.cfg` file.    - Fix python 3 bug: TypeError: Can't mix strings and bytes in path components## 0.1.10- Added better backwards compatibility for previous changes.- Simplified nbinit theme management and use `'default'` theme as default.    - New themes only need to overwrite what they need.    - Don't change fonts as default since this does not work well on CoCalc (the code      cells change size on clicking which is a pain.)## 0.1.9- Resolve issues:    - \#17: store `mmf_setup.HGROOT`    - \#18: safer exception handling with `nbclean` commands so data is not lost    - \#19: `nbclean` works with new mercurial API- Added `\erfi`, `\sech`, `\Braket`- `import mmf_setup.set_path.hgroot` will add `HGROOT` to path without IPython- Added standalone `nbinit.py` for use without `mmf_setup` installs.## 0.1.8- Resolves issue #15.- Use `$BASH_SOURCE{0}` to get `BIN_DIR` (resolves issue #16)- Added `nbinit(hgroot)` option to add `hg root` to `sys.path` (issue #13)## 0.1.7- Changed option to `--clean-all` (resolves issue #7)- Updated the notebook style (added `\Tr`, fixed output overflow issue)- Added pip option mmf_setup[nbextensions]- Removed `'EnableNBExtensionApp'` dependence which broke new Jupyter (resolves issue  #12)- Added some files for initializing setup on Sage Mathcloud (SMC) (resolves issue #14).    - Added `mmf_initial_setup` script and some init files (`.inputrc`, `.hgrc`,      `.bash_aliases`).    - Run with `mmf_setup smc`- Removed old extension manager since nbextensions are quite good now.## 0.1.6- Added cupdate command (resolves issue #4)- Fixed bug with ccommit where it did not accept a list of files  (issue #6)- Issue commands in a context to provide a robust mechanism for  recovery (issue #5)</longdescription>

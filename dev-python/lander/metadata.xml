python -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1Get metadata from an lsstdoc document-------------------------------------With the ``--lsstdoc &lt;tex path&gt;`` argument, Lander will attempt to scrape metadata from the source of a ``lsstdoc``-class LaTeX file, including:- abstract- authors- document handle- titleSee https://lsst-texmf.lsst.io for information about the ``lsstdoc`` class.Get metadata from the Travis environment----------------------------------------If you're running on Travis CI, set the ``--env=travis`` to get metadata from Travis's environment variables:- ``$TRAVIS_COMMIT``- ``$TRAVIS_BRANCH``- ``$TRAVIS_TAG``- ``$TRAVIS_REPO_SLUG``- ``$TRAVIS_JOB_NUMBER``Overriding metadata-------------------Lander tries to get as much metadata from the environment as possible (including from the Git repository and the LaTeX document itself), but sometimes this isn't possible.In this case you can explicitly set metadata with these flags (see ``lander -h`` for more information):- ``--abstract``- ``--authors`` (see note)- ``--title``- ``--handle`` (such as ``LDM-151``)- ``--repo-url`` (such as ``https://github.com/lsst/ldm-151``)- ``--repo-branch`` (such as ``master``)- ``--date`` (such as ``2017-05-22``)- ``--docushare-url`` (prefer the multi-version form, ``https://ls.st/ldm-151*``)``--authors`` should be a JSON-formatted array, even for a single author.For example::  --authors &quot;[\&quot;First Author\&quot;, \&quot;Second Author\&quot;]&quot;Distributing extra files from the landing page----------------------------------------------To include ancillary files with the main PDF document, provide their file paths with the ``--extra-download`` argument.These extra files are listed in the **Downloads** section of the landing page.The main PDF is always included first in this list.For example::   --extra-download demo.ipynbUploading to LSST the Docs--------------------------Lander works well with LSST the Docs.Lander can upload pages directly to LSST the Docs for you with these configurations:- ``--upload`` — provide this flag to indicate a build should be uploaded.- ``--ltd-product`` — Name of the product on LSST the Docs.- ``--keeper-url`` or ``$LTD_KEEPER_URL``.- ``--keeper-user`` or ``$LTD_KEEPER_USER``.- ``--keeper-password`` or ``$LTD_KEEPER_PASSWORD``.- ``--aws-id`` or ``$LTD_AWS_ID``.- ``--aws-secret`` or ``$LTD_AWS_SECRET``.Note: these are advanced configurations and are typically added to a CI configuration automatically or by a Documentation Engineer.Reach out to `#dm-docs &lt;https://lsstc.slack.com/messages/C2B6DQBAL/&gt;`_ on Slack for help.Development workflow====================You need both Python 3.5+ and `node.js`_ to develop Lander.Initial set up--------------Clone and install dependencies (use a Python virtual environment of your choice)::   git clone https://github.com/lsst-sqre/lander   cd lander   npm install -g gulp-cli   npm install   gulp assets   pip install -e &quot;.[dev]&quot;Run Python tests and linting----------------------------We use pytest for unit testing and style checks::   make pytestYou can also run end-to-end trials of landing page builds::   make testThese integration tests clone real LSST documents, compiles them with Docker, and builds landing pages to simulate continuous delivery workflows in production.Look for sites in ``_tests``.Build a development site------------------------The default gulp_ workflow creates website assets and generates a test website::   gulpThis gulp task runs a browsersync_ server and refreshes the page whenever CSS, JavaScript, or HTML assets change.Only build assets-----------------If you want to only build CSS, icon, and JavaScript assets, run this task::   gulp assets --env=deployThis is how assets are built on CI for releases of Lander.Developing CSS/Sass with squared--------------------------------Lander uses squared_ for visual design.All Lander CSS should be committed to the squared_ repo so that LSST SQuaRE web projects share a common visual language.To make it easier to write Sass in squared_ while developing landing pages in Lander, we recommend linking a clone of squared_ to Lander's ``node_modules``.Assuming you're starting from the ``lander/`` root directory::  git clone https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squared ../squared  npm link ../squaredSome patterns:- If you're working on a branch in squared_, then update squared's version in ``package.json`` to that branch.  For example: ``&quot;squared&quot;: &quot;lsst-sqre/squared#tickets/DM-10503&quot;``.  This allows Travis to install the development version of squared_ when testing Lander.  Remember to make a release of squared_ before releasing a new version of Lander, see below.- ``scss/app.scss`` in the lander repo imports Sass partials from squared_ and other packages (including inuitcss_).Release workflow================1. If squared_ was modified, create a squared_ release first.2. Update ``package.json`` with the released version of squared_.   Using tagged npm releases is preferred to GitHub branches to make builds of releases repeatable.3. Create a signed tag: ``git tag -s 0.1.0 -m &quot;v0.1.0&quot;``. Use the `PEP 440`_ schema.4. Push the tag: ``git push --tags``. This will automatically create a Lander release on PyPI.5. Merge the development branch as necessary.License=======This project is open sourced under the MIT license.See `LICENSE &lt;./LICENSE&gt;`_ for details... _squared: https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squared.. _`PEP 440`: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/.. _inuitcss: https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss.. _browsersync: https://browsersync.io.. _gulp: http://gulpjs.com.. _node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/##########Change Log##########1.0.6 (2023-07-04)==================- Pin ``pydantic&lt;2.0.0``.- Drop support for Python 3.7.1.0.1 (2021-05-11)==================- Pin click&lt;8 since Click 8.0.0 currently triggers the ``--version`` mode, regardless of whether it was set on the command-line or not.1.0.0 (2021-01-06)==================This is the first release of Lander!The version 1 release line is based on the 0.1 releases, and this line will continue to be maintained for existing users of Lander.A new version of Lander is under development, version 2.0, that will include a plugin interface for adding custom document parsers and website themes.0.1.16 (2019-07-04)===================- Update Jinja to &gt;=2.10.1 to address CVE-2019-10906.- Update asset build pipeline to Gulp 4 and update all other npm dependencies at the same time.0.1.15 (2019-04-02)===================- Update to ``lsst-projectmeta-kit`` to 0.3.5 for better author parsing.- Update ``requests`` to 2.20.0 (security).0.1.14 (2019-02-18)===================- Lander will now cleanly abort when building on Travis CI, but the secure environment variables are not available.  This happens if the build is triggered by a fork.- Switched to use ``$TRAVIS_BUILD_WEB_URL`` to get a URL to the build.  This is better than computing the build URL during the travis-ci.org to travis-ci.com transition.- Updated test dependencies to pytest 4.2.1.- Switched to ``setuptools_scm`` for version string management.0.1.13 (2018-11-26)===================- Update to lsst-projectmeta-kit 0.3.3 for improved detection of ``\input`` and ``\include`` commands in TeX source.0.1.12 (2018-02-10)===================- Update to ``lsst-projectmeta-kit`` 0.3.1 for more reliable ``metadata.jsonld`` generation (works around pandoc issues converting some documents to plain text).  There's a new integration test ``make dmtn070`` that demos this.- Improve the testing strategy:  - Run ``make pytest`` to run pytest with the correct arguments instead of using ``--add-opts`` in setup.cfg. This lets us run ``pytest`` directly with ad hoc arguments.  - Run ``make test`` to run both pytest and the integration tests.0.1.11 (2018-02-07)===================- Lander now creates and uploads a ``metadata.jsonld`` document alongside the landing page content (e.g., ``index.html``).  This content can be ingested by other tools into the LSST Projectmeta database.- Switch from metasrc to lsst-projectmeta-kit 0.3.0.  It's the same package, but the new and rebranded lsst-projectmeta-kit includes the ability to generate JSON-LD from an ``LsstLatexDoc`` object.0.1.10 (2017-12-11)===================- Change known domain for DocuShare from ``docushare.lsstcorp.org`` to ``docushare.lsst.org``.  This ensures that ``ls.st`` short links can continue to be verified.- Create default values for ``abstract_plain`` and ``title_plain``.  This fixes cases where the abstract is not set in the underlying LaTeX document.0.1.9 (2017-11-20)==================- Update metasrc to 0.2.2 to resolve issues with auto-downloading Pandoc in Travis CI (`DM-12569 &lt;https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-12569&gt;`_).- Update pytest to 3.2.5 and pytest-flake8 to 0.9.1 to fix incompatibilities in the floating indirect dependencies.0.1.8 (2017-10-09)==================- Update metasrc to 0.2.1- Use metasrc's ``LsstLatexDoc.revision_datetime`` to obtain the date of a document.  This method uses a combination of parsing the ``\date`` LaTeX command, looking at content  Git commits, and falling back to 'now' to get an appropriate timestamp.0.1.7 (2017-09-28)==================- Update metasrc to 0.2.0.  This provides Pandoc integration for improved HTML rendering of content extracted from LaTeX documents.- Improve how loggers are configured (warning level for third-party loggers, and info/debug levels for first-party LSST SQuaRE code).0.1.6 (2017-09-07)==================- Update metasrc to 0.1.4.  This update provides improved LaTeX command metadata extraction.  (`DM-11821 &lt;https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-11821&gt;`_)- Temporarily skip ls.st and DocuShare-related unit tests because ls.st links to DocuShare are broken due to the DocuShare upgrade.0.1.5 (2017-07-12)==================- Pin to metasrc 0.1.3- Via metasrc, Lander has improved LaTeX source processing, including handling of referenced source files (``\input`` and ``\include``) and macros (``\def`` and ``\newcommand``).- Improved treatment of draft status.  The heuristic is that a document is considered a draft if the branch is not ``master`` and ``lsstdraft`` is not present in a lsstdoc document's options.0.1.4 (2017-07-06)==================- Fix logic for determining it Lander is running in a Travis PR environment.- Log the Lander version at startup.0.1.3 (2017-07-02)==================- Fixed Travis deployment issue. Used ``skip_cleanup: true`` to ``.travis.yml`` to prevent CSS and JS assets from bring cleaned up before creating a release.0.1.2 (2017-06-27)==================- Detect if running from a Travis PR build (using the ``TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST`` environment variable) and if so, abort the page build and upload.  This is to prevent duplicate uploads from both branch and PR-based Travis jobs.- Pin inuitcss to 6.0.0-beta4 because of the removal of rem functions in beta5.0.1.1 (2017-06-17)==================- Update to ``metasrc&gt;=0.1.1,&lt;0.2``.- Use ``remove_comments`` and ``remove_trailing_whitespace`` feature from metasrc.  This improves the accuracy of metadata extraction from tex source.  For example, comment characters won't appear in extract abstract content.0.1.0 (2017-05-24)==================Initial version.- Native PDF display via `PDFObject &lt;https://pdfobject.com&gt;`_.- Multi-level metadata model for populating the landing page.  Lander uses https://github.com/lsst-sqre/metasrc to extract content from the ``tex`` source (more work on this is needed).  Otherwise, it gets data from environment variables (including Travis CI variables).  Finally, metadata can be specified explicitly with command line arguments.- Uses https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squared for CSS, icons, and logos.  A Gulp and webpack workflow build these sources into deployable dependencies.  Gulp and webpack are only needed by developers and CI; the deployable artifacts are included in PyPI releases.- Release workflow is fully automated in Travis.  Create a PEP 440 version tag, push it, and the release appears in PyPI.- Includes an LSST the Docs upload client (via https://github.com/lsst-sqre/ltd-conveyor) built-in so that https://github.com/lsst-sqre/ltd-mason isn't required.- Usage and development docs are currently in the README.MIT LicenseCopyright (c) 2017 Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc.Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copyof this software and associated documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to dealin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rightsto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sellcopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software isfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in allcopies or substantial portions of the Software.THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS ORIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

	<longdescription>[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/childsish/lhc-python.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/childsish/lhc-python)lhc-python==========This is my personal library of python classes and functions, many of them have bioinformatics applications. The library changes constantly and at a whim. If you want to use it, approach with caution. Over time however, parts appear to be settling on a stable configuration.lhc.binf--------**lhc.binf.alignment**A pure Python implementation of the Smith-Waterman local alignment algorithm.**lhc.binf.digen**A C++ and pure Python implementation of sequence generation algorithm. The generated sequence will have a specified dinucleotide frequency.**lhc.binf.genomic_coordinate**An implementation of intervals and points for genomic coordinates. Useful for representing gene models.**lhc.binf.genetic_code**A class to read genetic codes and translate DNA sequences into protein sequences**lhc.binf.iupac**A class to convert protein names between the one and three letter codes and the full name.**lhc.binf.kmer**A class that calculates k-mers for a given sequence. The class behaves likea dict, but calculates new k-mers on the fly.**lhc.binf.skew**A class that calculates skews for a given sequence. The class behaves like a dict, but calculates new skews on the fly.lhc.collections---------------Several collections mostly for holding intervals. If only intervals need to be held, use the IntervalTree, otherwise the MultiDimensionMap may be more appropriate.lhc.filetools-------------Classes for working with fileslhc.graph---------A pure Python implementation of graphslhc.indices-----------Intended to be my own code for indexing files but is still very unstable an immaturelhc.interval------------A class for intervals and interval operationslhc.io------Classes for parsing and working with several file formatslhc.itertools-------------Classes for working with iteratorslhc.tools---------Various classes, mostly unused and out-of-datelhc.random----------**lhc.random.reservoir**An implementation of the reservoir sampling algorithm. Can also be run from the command line to sample lines from files. To sample 50 lines from a file called input_file.txt, run:```bashpython -m lhc.random.reservoir input_file.txt 50```lhc.stats---------Really old code. Probably the NIPALS and PCA algorithms are of most use.lhc.test--------Unit tests! These should be mostly up-to-date now.lhc.tools---------**lhc.tools.sorter**A sorter for very large iterators. The iterator will be split into chunks which are then sorted individually and then merged into a single file.**lhc.tools.tokeniser**A basic tokeniser. Users define which characters belong to which classes and the tokeniser will split strings into substrings where all characters have the same type.```python&gt;&gt;&gt; tokeniser = Tokeniser({'word': 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz',                       'number': '0123456789',                       'space': ' \t'})&gt;&gt;&gt; tokens = tokeniser.tokenise('there were 1000 bottles on the wall')&gt;&gt;&gt; tokeniser.next()Token(type='word', value='there')&gt;&gt;&gt; tokeniser.next()Token(type='space', value=' ')&gt;&gt;&gt; tokeniser.next()Token(type='word', value='were')&gt;&gt;&gt; tokeniser.next()Token(type='space', value=' ')&gt;&gt;&gt; tokeniser.next()Token(type='number', value='1000')```</longdescription>

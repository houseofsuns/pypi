  * Yet another part needed to be removed.     2023.2.16 -- Thoroughly removing calls to OptKing   * OptKing is causing compatibility issues, and is not currently being used in the     Python, so am temporarily removing it.2023.1.23 (23 January 2023)---------------------------* Corrected bugs, including if no dispersion term requested* Added preliminary version of accelerated optimization using  MOPAC for Hessians, etc. May not fully work at the moment.* Updated documentation theme and structure to match new style.2022.11.18 -- Added total charge and multiplicity to Psi4 input2021.2.11 (11 February 2021)----------------------------* Updated the README file to give a better description.* Updated the short description in setup.py to work with the new installer.* Added keywords for better searchability.2021.2.4 (4 February 2021)--------------------------* Updated for compatibility with the new system classes in MolSystem  2021.2.2 release.2020.12.5 (5 December 2020)---------------------------* Internal: switching CI from TravisCI to GitHub Actions, and in the  process moving documentation from ReadTheDocs to GitHub Pages where  it is consolidated with the main SEAMM documentation.2020.11.2 (2 November 2020)---------------------------* Updated to be compatible with the new command-line argument  handling.2020.9.28 (28 September 2020)-----------------------------* Improved handling of results  - Selection depends on both calculation and method.  - Arrays can be stored in variables (but not tables!).  - Multipoles gathered as arrays rather than a large number of scalars.2020.8.1 (1 August 2020)------------------------* Fixed minor bugs.2020.7.3 (24 July 2020)------------------------* Added control options for number of threads and amount of memory to  use.2020.7.2 (23 July 2020)------------------------* First pass at specifying number of threads and amount of memory.2020.7.1 (23 July 2020)------------------------* Added substep for optimization.2020.7.0 (21 July 2020)------------------------* First release on PyPI of initial working version.</longdescription>

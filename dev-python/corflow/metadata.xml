	<longdescription># CorflowA file conversion/manipulation software for corpus linguistics.See the [Github's wiki](https://github.com/DoReCo/corflow/wiki) for documentation.## 0. Readme updatesFrançois Delafontaine: Neuchâtel (Switzerland), 22.08.2022## 1. Context*Corflow*, originally the 'multitool', has been started around 2015 to anonymize and convert files for the [OFROM](http://www11.unine.ch/) corpus (at Neuchatel, Switzerland). Initially in C++, it was reworked between 2016-9 in the ANR-DFG [SegCor](segcor.cnrs.fr) project (at Orleans, France) and translated in Python. It is now and since 2019 being developped within the ANR-DFG [DoReCo](http://www.doreco.info/) project (at Lyon, France). ## 2. ObjectivesWhile core objectives are the conversion and manipulation of files in the context of corpus linguistics (notably oral linguistics), some precisions are needed.But first: *conversion* means changing a file's format. A *format* is the way information is stored in the file. We will generally use the software or collection associated with a format to designate the format itself. *Elan-to-Praat* for example means converting from the '.eaf' format to the '.TextGrid' format. Finally *manipulation* means operations on the stored information itself: merging, anonymization, inter-rater agreement, etc. In details, the objectives are:1. An &quot;X-to-Y&quot; conversion: meaning conversion should be possible from any supported format to any other supported format (see [Pepper](https://corpus-tools.org/pepper/)'s swiss-army knife approach).2. A *lossless* conversion: meaning that as little information should be lost during conversion as is feasible. 3. Accessibility: meaning that the package should be available (a) for automatic integration, (b) through command prompt and (c) through a dedicated graphical interface.4. More accessibility: meaning that the package should require as few third-party libraries as possible, be easy to understand and to expand (by users adding their own scripts).This software's public (in corpus linguistics) is expected to have little to no experience with code. More advanced users are expected to prefer [Pepper](https://corpus-tools.org/pepper/). ## 3. LimitationsNo versioning has been yet set in place.* No user interface provided.* No customized error messages.* Current supported formats are. 'Praat (.TextGrid)', 'Elan (.eaf)', 'Pangloss (.xml)'.Testing has been limited and users should expect potential errors. TEI import is still in development. ## 4. PackageIn its Python version, Corflow is considered as a package to import as is. That package corresponds to the `conversion` folder.The *conversion* folder should contain a 'Transcription.py' file and a set of 'fromX.py' and 'toX.py' files (for import and export respectively). ## 5. How does it work?Corflow is built around a `Transcription` class used for &quot;universal&quot; information storage: all information from all the supported formats should fit in. Import scripts instantiate a Transcription object and fill it with the file's information; export scripts use a Transcription object to write a file:    X -fromX-&gt; Transcription -toY-&gt; YManipulations are expected to operate on Transcription objects:    X -fromX-&gt; Transcription -manipulation-&gt; Transcription -toY-&gt; YIn practice this can vary, as manipulations are open and dependent on the user's needs. The `Transcription` class is divided in (a) *data* and (b) *metadata*.(5a) `Data` is, for oral linguistics, what corresponds to a transcription. A transcription is text aligned to sound. The alignment relies on time points (`time boundaries` or `timestamps`). A set composed of a given text and two time boundaries (its start and end points relative to sound) is called a `Segment`: technically any arbitrary unit generated that way. *Segments* might not be linguistic units, and might not be units at all (and conversely, a linguistic unit like the *pause* might have no corresponding segment). A set of segments is called a `Tier` and a set of *tiers* corresponds to the whole *transcription*.We don't claim here that all *tiers*, that is, all sets of segments, are linguistic *transcriptions*. They can also represent translations, annotations, etc. Tiers, like segments, are type-neutral. (5b) `Metadata` is, for corpus linguistics, all information around the transcription: where, when, who, how... ```*Start* and *end* contain the time boundaries and the content the *text*. This is how data is stored in the `Transcription` class in general, although more variables exist.## 6. ConclusionThe question of [file conversion](https://corflo.hypotheses.org/122) might never be answered in a satisfactory manner. Originally just an nth homemade conversion tool, our hope is this becomes an easily-accessible package for other teams/projects to use either as is, for basic use, or by being able to quickly adapt it to their requirements.</longdescription>

	<longdescription># Jinja2 Ansible Filters## OverviewJinja2 Ansible Filters is a port of the ansible filters provided by Ansible's templating engine.This repository is not inteded to supplant ansible functionality however there are a lot of filters ansible provides that are not present in upstream Jinja2 so you may find these helpful.### Included filters- b64decode- b64encode- basename- bool- checksum- comment- dirname- expanduser- expandvars- extract- fileglob- flatten- from_json- from_yaml- from_yaml_all- ans_groupby- hash- mandatory- md5- quote- ans_random- random_mac- realpath- regex_escape- regex_findall- regex_replace- regex_search- relpath- sha1- shuffle- splitext- strftime- subelements- ternary- to_datetime- to_json- to_nice_json- to_nice_yaml- to_uuid- to_yaml- type_debug- win_basename- win_dirname- win_splitdrive### Renamed filtersDue to naming conflicts with Jinja2 builtin filters, these filters have been prefixed with ans_- groupby- randomso:- ans_groupby- ans_randomAdditionally any filter naming collisions detected at runtime will be renamed to ans_filter and a warning message raised for each.Several heavy filters have been omitted due to their extensive dependency on ansible core:### Excluded Filters- combine- get_encrypted_password- dict2items- items2dict## Install`pip install jinja2-ansible-filters`## Usage### Typical usage with jinja2```python  from jinja2 import Environment...  env = Environment(extensions=['jinja2_ansible_filters.AnsibleCoreFiltersExtension'])...# OR  from jinja2_ansible_filters import AnsibleCoreFiltersExtension  env = Environment(extensions=[AnsibleCoreFiltersExtension])...```### Include into cookiecuttercookiecutter.json```json{  &quot;_extensions&quot;: [&quot;jinja2_ansible_filters.AnsibleCoreFiltersExtension&quot;]}```## LicenseDue to multiple licenses in the Ansible source the licenses have both been included in LICENSE as well as proper attribution. Additionally license stubs where preserved with the source files they covered in the origional ansible repository.## [1.3.2](https://gitlab.com/dreamer-labs/libraries/jinja2-ansible-filters/compare/v1.3.1...v1.3.2) (2022-06-30)### Bug Fixes* Add VERSION to MANIFEST.in ([6dfc56a](https://gitlab.com/dreamer-labs/libraries/jinja2-ansible-filters/commit/6dfc56a))## [1.3.1](https://gitlab.com/dreamer-labs/libraries/jinja2-ansible-filters/compare/v1.3.0...v1.3.1) (2022-04-14)### Bug Fixes* environmentfilter renamed to pass_environment in jinja2&gt;=3.1 ([47f7173](https://gitlab.com/dreamer-labs/libraries/jinja2-ansible-filters/commit/47f7173))# [1.3.0](https://gitlab.com/dreamer-labs/libraries/jinja2-ansible-filters/compare/v1.2.1...v1.3.0) (2020-04-14)### Features* Adds Combine filter and tests ([085806b](https://gitlab.com/dreamer-labs/libraries/jinja2-ansible-filters/commit/085806b))## [1.2.1](https://gitlab.com/dreamer-labs/libraries/jinja2-ansible-filters/compare/v1.2.0...v1.2.1) (2019-11-15)### Bug Fixes* Fixed description by removing quotes ([2d29bff](https://gitlab.com/dreamer-labs/libraries/jinja2-ansible-filters/commit/2d29bff))# [1.2.0](https://gitlab.com/dreamer-labs/libraries/jinja2-ansible-filters/compare/v1.1.0...v1.2.0) (2019-11-07)### Features* removed six requirement from setup.cfg ([4902da9](https://gitlab.com/dreamer-labs/libraries/jinja2-ansible-filters/commit/4902da9))# [1.1.0](https://gitlab.com/dreamer-labs/libraries/jinja2-ansible-filters/compare/v1.0.0...v1.1.0) (2019-11-06)### Features* Added test  coverage to satisfactory level ([f14ca2c](https://gitlab.com/dreamer-labs/libraries/jinja2-ansible-filters/commit/f14ca2c))* Initial commit with full function and tests ([702e321](https://gitlab.com/dreamer-labs/libraries/jinja2-ansible-filters/commit/702e321))# 1.0.0 (2019-11-06)### Features* Added test  coverage to satisfactory level ([bbb0cb0](https://gitlab.com/dreamer-labs/libraries/jinja2-ansible-filters/commit/bbb0cb0))* Initial commit with full function and tests ([529c606](https://gitlab.com/dreamer-labs/libraries/jinja2-ansible-filters/commit/529c606))(c) 2019, Nick Shobe &lt;nickshobe@gmail.com&gt;(c) 2016, Toshio Kuratomi &lt;a.badger@gmail.com&gt;(c) 2012-2014, Michael DeHaan &lt;michael.dehaan@gmail.com&gt;This code is derived from Ansible's template Jinja2 filtersIt contains source released under two licenses GPL3 and BSD licenseApplicable licenses have been added to the respective files that they apply to.This code is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modifyit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published bythe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or(at your option) any later version.This code is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty ofMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

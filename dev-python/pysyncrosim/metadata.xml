While the installation instructions below are based on a Windows 10 operating system, similar steps can be used to install `pysyncrosim` for Linux.Before beginning the installation of `pysyncrosim`, make sure you have the latest release of [SyncroSim](https://syncrosim.com/download/) installed.### Dependencies`pysyncrosim` was tested and developed using **Python 3.8** and **SyncroSim 2.3.10**. Because `pysyncrosim` uses `rasterio` for integrating spatial data, it also requires a C library dependency: GDAL &gt;=2.3.```python&gt;=3.8pandas=1.3.2numpy=1.21.2rasterio&gt;=1.2.6```### Using `conda`Follow these steps to get started with `conda` and use `conda` to install `pysyncrosim`. 1. Install `conda` using the Miniconda or Anaconda installer (in this tutorial we use Miniconda). To install Miniconda, follow [this link](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and under the **Latest Miniconda Installer Links**, download Miniconda for your operating system. Open the Miniconda installer and follow the default steps to install `conda`. For more information, see the [conda documentation](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).2. To use `conda`, open the command prompt that was installed with the Miniconda installer. To find this prompt, type &quot;anaconda prompt&quot; in the **Windows Search Bar**. You should see an option appear called **Anaconda Prompt (miniconda3)**. Select this option to open a command line window. All code in the next steps will be typed in this window. 3. You can either install `pysyncrosim` and its dependencies into your base environment, or set up a new `conda` environment (recommended). Run the code below to set up and activate a new `conda` environment called &quot;myenv&quot; that uses Python 3.8.```# Create new conda environmentconda create -n myenv python=3.8# Activate environmentconda activate myenv```You should now see that &quot;(base)&quot; has been replaced with &quot;(myenv)&quot; at the beginning of each prompt.4. Set the package channel for `conda`. To be able to install the dependencies for `pysyncrosim`, you need to access the `conda-forge` package channel. To configure this channel, run the following code in the Anaconda Prompt.```# Set conda-forge package channelconda config --add channels conda-forge```5. Install `pysyncrosim` using `conda install`. Installing `pysyncrosim` will also install its dependencies: `pandas`, `numpy`, and `rasterio`.```# Install pysyncrosimconda install pysyncrosim````pysyncrosim` should now be installed and ready to use!### Using `pip`Use `pip` to install `pysyncrosim` to your default python installation. You can install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/. You can also find information on how to install `pip` from the [pip documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).Install `pysyncrosim` using `pip install`. Installing `pysyncrosim` will also install its dependencies: `pandas`, `numpy`, and `rasterio`.```# Make sure you are using the latest version of pippip install --upgrade pip# Install pysyncrosimpip install pysyncrosim```## Usage### Getting StartedFor a basic usage example with the [helloworldSpatial](https://apexrms.github.io/helloworldEnhanced/) package, see the [spatial_demo.py](https://github.com/syncrosim/pysyncrosim/blob/main/examples/spatial_demo.py) and [input-raster.tif](https://github.com/syncrosim/pysyncrosim/blob/main/examples/input-raster.tif) in the **examples** folder. To download the spatial_demo.py file, view the file on GitHub and select **Raw**. From the raw view, right-click and select **Save As...**. To run the spatial demo, you will also need to install the `matplotlib` Python package. You can install this package using the following code.```# Install matplotlibconda install matplotlib```### Running pysyncrosim in SpyderIf using `conda`, the `spyder` IDE is easy to install and straightforward to use.1. First, install `spyder` either in your base environment or in your `conda` environment using the following code.```# Install spyderconda install spyder```2. Open the IDE by typing `spyder` in the command prompt.```# Open spyderspyder```*Note: you may get a pop-up saying you have a missing dependency, `rtree`. You can safely ignore this warning.*3. Within the IDE, change the working directory to the directory containing your `pysyncrosim` scripts (e.g. [spatial_demo.py](https://github.com/syncrosim/pysyncrosim/blob/main/examples/spatial_demo.py) and [input-raster.tif](https://github.com/syncrosim/pysyncrosim/blob/main/examples/input-raster.tif))![Using pysyncrosim in Spyder](https://github.com/syncrosim/pysyncrosim/raw/main/docs/img/spyder.PNG)4. Open and run your `pysyncrosim` scripts from the left-hand window. You can run scripts line-by-line in `spyder` by selecting the line(s) you want to run and pressing F9.### SyncroSim Package DevelopmentIf you wish to design SyncroSim packages using python and `pysyncrosim`, you can follow the [Creating a Package](http://docs.syncrosim.com/how_to_guides/package_create_overview.html) and [Enhancing a Package](http://docs.syncrosim.com/how_to_guides/package_enhance_overview.html) tutorials on the [SyncroSim documentation website](http://docs.syncrosim.com/). Note that [SyncroSim v2.3.10](https://syncrosim.com/download/) is required to develop python-based SyncroSim packages.</longdescription>

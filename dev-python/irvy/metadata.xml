	<longdescription># IrvyIrvy simplifies the setup process for test automation using Selenium or Playwright across multiple programming languages. It serves as a valuable tool for both novice automation engineers and seasoned professionals, facilitating a seamless transition between programming languages such as Java, C#, or JavaScript by providing comparable building blocks.In an ever-evolving technological landscape, the demand for efficient and versatile test automation tools has never been greater. Irvy, a command-line interface tool, steps up to this challenge by streamlining the setup process for test automation across a broad spectrum of programming languages. Whether you are a novice entering the world of automation engineering or a seasoned veteran, Irvy’s ability to provide comparable building blocks facilitates an effortless transition between different programming languages such as Java, C#, or JavaScript.Harnessing the capabilities of popular automation tools like Selenium and Playwright, Irvy empowers users to initiate projects in their language of choice with a simple, interactive command-line interface. This process alleviates the potential complexities associated with the setup phase, allowing users to focus their attention on the development of high-quality, robust automation scripts.In addition, Irvy fosters an environment of continuous learning and skill diversification. For seasoned professionals who have primarily worked in a single programming language, Irvy offers a comfortable, straightforward entry point to explore and adopt different languages. This not only widens their skillset but also broadens their perspective on the different strategies and approaches to test automation.## Features- Setup Selenium projects in Python, C#, and JavaScript.- Setup Playwright projects in Python, C#, and JavaScript.- Interactive command-line interface.# Installation and Usage Guide for IrvyThis guide will walk you through installing Python and using Irvy on different operating systems. We will cover installation on Windows, MacOS, and Linux.## PrerequisitesBefore we start, ensure you have the following:- A working computer with one of the following operating systems: Windows, MacOS, Linux.- Access to the command line terminal.## Installing PythonIrvy requires Python 3.7 or later. Follow the steps below to install Python on your operating system.### Windows1. Download the latest Python release from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).2. Run the installer, ensure &quot;Add Python to PATH&quot; is checked, then follow the installation prompts.### MacOS1. MacOS comes preinstalled with Python, but it's typically an older version. You can use Homebrew to install the latest version.2. If you don't have Homebrew, install it with the following command:   ```bash   /bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)&quot;   ```3. Install Python with Homebrew:   ```bash   brew install python   ```### LinuxDifferent Linux distributions have different methods to install Python. Here's how you can install Python on Ubuntu:1. Update your system:   ```bash   sudo apt update   sudo apt upgrade   ```2. Install Python:   ```bash   sudo apt install python3   ```## Verify Python InstallationVerify your Python installation by checking the version in your terminal:```bashpython --version```You should see output like `Python 3.11.3` or later.## Install IrvyYou can install Irvy directly from PyPI using pip:```bashpip install irvy```## Using IrvyAfter successfully installing Irvy, you can run it by simply typing the following command in your terminal:```bashirvy```This will start an interactive command-line interface where you can select the language and tool you want to use for your project. Follow the prompts to generate your test automation project.This will start an interactive command-line interface where you can choose the language and tool you want to use for your project.![image](https://github.com/automationpi/irvy/assets/82222256/2b680165-c947-4bfb-ae3c-cac93a012294)Select technology![image](https://github.com/automationpi/irvy/assets/82222256/85b840fa-4232-4f99-bee8-df8a90495c46)Select tool you want to use# Project Structure```project_name/|-- .gitignore|-- README.md|-- package.json OR requirements.txt OR .csproj|-- src/    |-- tests/        |-- test_example.js OR test_example.py OR test_example.cs|-- node_modules/ OR venv/ OR packages/```https://github.com/automationpi/irvy/assets/82222256/4a780b2c-8779-4980-a568-1dd715bb319e# Technologies and FrameworksDepending on the language and tool you choose, Irvy will use different testing frameworks:```Python: Irvy will use Pytest for both Selenium and Playwright projects.C#: Irvy will use xUnit for both Selenium and Playwright projects.JavaScript: Irvy will use Jest for both Selenium and Playwright projects.```# ContributingPull requests are welcome.

	<longdescription>## Welcome to the cdk-stepfunctions-redshift project!`cdk-stepfunctions-redshift` provides `SfnRedshiftTasker` which is a JSII construct library to build AWS Serverlessinfrastructure to implement a callback pattern for Amazon Redshift statements.The `SfnRedshiftTasker` construct will take details of a Redshift target (clustername, database name &amp; username) andthe resulting object will have a `lambdaFunction` property which will provide the interface to run statements againstthat Redshift target with callback functionality.The current solution supports implementing 2 callback patterns:* Step functions: have a state that issues a SQL statement and have it only transition once the statement succeeds or  fails (see [stepfunction_redshift_integration.md](/docs/stepfunction_redshift_integration.md) for how to use this)* Cloud formation: After running the SQL statement do a callback to signal cloudformation success or failure (see  [cloudformation_redhsift_integration.md](/docs/cloudformation_redshift_integration.md) for how to use this)## Behind the scenesWhen you use a `SfnRedshiftTasker` in your stack you will get:* A Lambda function for invoking tasks on the Amazon Redshift cluster* A DDB Table to track ongoing-executions* An Event rule to monitor Amazon Redshift Data API completion events and route them to SQS* An SQS queue to receive above mentioned Amazon Redshift Data API completion events* A Lambda function to process API Completions events (by default same function as the one above)* A KMS key which encrypts data at rest.This allows to easily create step-function tasks which execute a SQL command and will only completeonce Amazon Redshift finishes executing the corresponding statement.### How it worksServerless infrastructure will be spawn up for a specific (cluster, user, database). A Lambda function will be providedwhich allows invoking statements as this user.  States can then be used to do a seemingly synchronous invocation of aAmazon Redshift statement allowing your statemachines to have a simpler definition (see[Example definition](/docs/stepfunction_redshift_integration.md#step-function-definition) for an example state).#### Example flow (for step function)![alt text](images/aws-step-function-redshift-integration.png?raw=1)1. A step-function step triggers the Lambda function provided by the construct. The step function step follows a   structure for its invocation payload which includes designated fields (following the [API of the invoker function](/lambda/python/rs_integration_function/README.md))2. The Lambda function will generate a unique ID based on the execution ARN and register the SQL invocation in a   DynamoDB state table.3. The lambda function then starts the statement using the Amazon Redshift data API using the Unique ID as statement   name and requesting events for state changes.4. As a result of step 3 Amazon Redshift executes the statement. Once that statement completes it emits an event. Our   building blocks have put in place a Cloudwatch Rule to monitor these events.5. The event gets placed into an SQS queue6. This SQS queue is monitored by a Lambda function (could be the same as the previous one).7. The Lambda function will check whether the finished query is related to a step function invocation in order to   retrieve the task token of the step.8. If it is then it will do a succeed/fail callback to the step-function step (using the task token) depending on   success/failure of the SQL statement.9. It will mark the invocation as processed in the state table.## How to useThis is a construct so you can use it from a CDK Stack. An example stack can be found at [integ.default.ts](src/integ.default.ts).  That stack sets up an Amazon Redshift cluster, the `SfnRedshiftTasker` infra and some state machines that use thefunctionality. It can be launched by compiling the code (which creates a lib directory) and deploying the CDK app:`yarn compile &amp;&amp; npx cdk --app ./lib/integ.default.js deploy`### ConsiderationsWhen using this approach do keep in mind the considerations of the [Amazon Redshift Data API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/data-api.html#data-api-calling-considerations).These shouldn't be blockers:* If query result is too big consider using `UNLOAD` rather than `SELECT`.* If the statement size is too big consider splitting up the statement in multiple statements. For example by  defining and utilizing views or encapsulating the logic in a stored procedure.## SecuritySee [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md#security-issue-notifications) for more information.## LicenseThis library is licensed under the MIT-0 License.

	<longdescription># MadeiraThis is a python package which provides wrapper classes and convenience methods for the Amazon Web Servces (AWS) python deployment SDK (`boto3`).In several deployment automation projects I've built over the years, I've found that &quot;bare metal control&quot; over interaction with AWS services allows me to leverage features released by AWS into `boto3` the moment they're available, rather than waiting on 3rd party CM tool authors/vendors to wrap *all* required functionality. Concurrently, this reduces the footprint of project external dependencies.Given that most projects I work on are &quot;pure python&quot;, this approach requires less mental context switching compared to using template-driven CM tools. ## InstallationThis package is hosted on [PyPI](pypi.org), so you may simply:```pip install --user madeira```## SupportIntended for use with Python 3.7 or later.## LimitationsNot all AWS services are represented; similarly, not all features of AWS servicesthat are represented here are &quot;wrapped&quot;.## Package name originsSince the AWS python SDK is called `boto`, which refers to Amazon River dolphins,I figured I'd attempt to follow the pattern and name this after a tributary of the Amazon River, given that the point of these wrappers is to deploy objects into AWS,The analogy seemed to solve the problem of developer naming creativity...:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:</longdescription>

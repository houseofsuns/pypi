	<longdescription>==================================python-multiprocessing==================================About-----`multiprocessing` is a back port of the Python 2.6/3.0 `multiprocessing &lt;http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html&gt;`_package. The multiprocessing package itself is a renamed and updated version of R Oudkerk's `pyprocessing &lt;http://pypi.python.org/pypi/processing/&gt;`_ package.This standalone variant is intended to be compatible with Python 2.4 and 2.5, and will draw it's fixes/improvements from python-trunk.This package would not be possible if not for the contributions of not onlythe current maintainers but all of the contributors to the original pyprocessingpackage listed `here &lt;http://pyprocessing.berlios.de/doc/THANKS.html&gt;`_The multiprocessing package monkey patches several aspects of the `threading`module to make it forward compatible with Python 2.6. The patches are non-intrusive and don't change existing functions. See `multiprocessing.patch`for detailed informations.Please refer to `&lt;http://www.python.org/doc/2.6/library/multiprocessing.html&gt;`_for more information about the `multiprocessing` package.Bug reporting-------------Please report bugs related to multiprocessing at the `Python bug tracker &lt;http://bugs.python.org/&gt;`_. Issues related to the packaging ofmultiprocessing should be reported at `&lt;http://code.google.com/p/python-multiprocessing/&gt;`_.===========Changes===========2.6.2.1 -- 2009-07-30--------------------- * Issues #5155, 5313, 5331: multiprocessing.Process._bootstrap was   unconditionally calling &quot;os.close(sys.stdin.fileno())&quot; resulting in file   descriptor errors * Issue #5400: Added patch for multiprocessing on netbsd compilation/support * Fix and properly document the multiprocessing module's logging   support, expose the internal levels and provide proper usage   examples. * Issue #5261: Patch multiprocessing's semaphore.c to support context   manager use: &quot;with multiprocessing.Lock()&quot; works now. * Issue #3321: _multiprocessing.Connection() doesn't check handle; added checks   for *nix machines for negative handles and large int handles. Without this   check it is possible to segfault the interpreter. * Issue #4301: Patch the logging module to add processName support, remove   _check_logger_class from multiprocessing.2.6.1.1 -- 2009-02-07--------------------- * Fixed an issue with `make doc` * mp docs - fix issues 4012,3518,4193 (Python svn: r67419) * issue4238: bsd support for cpu_count (Python svn: r67423) * Move definition int sval into branch of ifdef where it is used.   Otherwise, you get a warning about an undefined variable.   (Python svn: r67440) * Fixed a segfault in connection_recvbytes_into() which occured   with Python debug builds on 64bit Linux. * Added reference to `Issue 1683 http://bugs.python.org/issue1683`_. * issue 4301: patch logging to add processName, remove the old    _check_logger_class code (Python svn: r68737) * Resolve issue 3321: (segfault) _multiprocessing.Connection()    doesn't check handle (Python svn: r68768) * Documentation update2.6.0.2 -- 2008-11-27---------------------The release is based on 2.6.0+ and contains additional fixesfrom Python svn. * Issue #5: Added monkey patch to make the threading module forward    compatible with Python 2.6 and 3.0.  * Python Issue #4204: Fixed a compilation issue on FreeBSD 4. * Removed ``install`` target from Makefile. * Updated comments of Modules/mmapmodules.c. The modifications   and origin are clearly marked now. * Added sphinx builder for docs and new make target ``docs``. * Changed version schema to Python.version.number.internal_revision * Pulled doc fixes from Python svn: r67189, r67330, r673322.6.0-0.1 -- 2008-10-27-----------------------The release is based on Python 2.6.0. * Initial release</longdescription>

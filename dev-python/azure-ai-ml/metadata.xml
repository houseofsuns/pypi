	<longdescription># Azure ML Package client library for PythonWe are excited to introduce the GA of Azure Machine Learning Python SDK v2. The Python SDK v2 introduces new SDK capabilities like standalone local jobs, reusable components for pipelines and managed online/batch inferencing. Python SDK v2 allows you to move from simple to complex tasks easily and incrementally. This is enabled by using a common object model which brings concept reuse and consistency of actions across various tasks. The SDK v2 shares its foundation with the CLI v2 which is also GA.[Source code][source_code]| [Package (PyPI)][ml_pypi]| [Package (Conda)](https://anaconda.org/microsoft/azure-ai-ml/)| [API reference documentation][ml_ref_docs]| [Product documentation][product_documentation]| [Samples][ml_samples]This package has been tested with Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10.For a more complete set of Azure libraries, see https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/all## Getting started### Prerequisites- Python 3.7 or later is required to use this package.- You must have an [Azure subscription][azure_subscription].- An [Azure Machine Learning Workspace][workspace].### Install the packageInstall the Azure ML client library for Python with [pip][pip_link]:```bashpip install azure-ai-mlpip install azure-identity```### Authenticate the client```pythonfrom azure.ai.ml import MLClientfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredentialml_client = MLClient(    DefaultAzureCredential(), subscription_id, resource_group, workspace)```## Key conceptsAzure Machine Learning Python SDK v2 comes with many new features like standalone local jobs, reusable components for pipelines and managed online/batch inferencing. The SDK v2 brings consistency and ease of use across all assets of the platform. The Python SDK v2 offers the following capabilities:* Run **Standalone Jobs** - run a discrete ML activity as Job. This job can be run locally or on the cloud. We currently support the following types of jobs:  * Command - run a command (Python, R, Windows Command, Linux Shell etc.)  * Sweep - run a hyperparameter sweep on your Command* Run multiple jobs using our **improved Pipelines**  * Run a series of commands stitched into a pipeline (**New**)  * **Components** - run pipelines using reusable components (**New**)* Use your models for **Managed Online inferencing** (**New**)* Use your models for Managed **batch inferencing*** Manage AML resources – workspace, compute, datastores* Manage AML assets - Datasets, environments, models* **AutoML** - run standalone AutoML training for various ml-tasks:  - Classification (Tabular data)  - Regression (Tabular data)  - Time Series Forecasting (Tabular data)  - Image Classification (Multi-class) (**New**)  - Image Classification (Multi-label) (**New**)  - Image Object Detection (**New**)  - Image Instance Segmentation (**New**)  - NLP Text Classification (Multi-class) (**New**)  - NLP Text Classification (Multi-label) (**New**)  - NLP Text Named Entity Recognition (NER) (**New**)## Examples- View our [samples][ml_samples].## Troubleshooting### GeneralAzure ML clients raise exceptions defined in [Azure Core][azure_core_readme].```pythonfrom azure.core.exceptions import HttpResponseErrortry:    ml_client.compute.get(&quot;cpu-cluster&quot;)except HttpResponseError as error:    print(&quot;Request failed: {}&quot;.format(error.message))```### LoggingThis library uses the standard[logging][python_logging] library for logging.Basic information about HTTP sessions (URLs, headers, etc.) is logged at INFOlevel.Detailed DEBUG level logging, including request/response bodies and unredactedheaders, can be enabled on a client with the `logging_enable` argument.See full SDK logging documentation with examples [here][sdk_logging_docs].### TelemetryThe Azure ML Python SDK includes a telemetry feature that collects usage and failure data about the SDK and sends it to Microsoft when you use the SDK in a Jupyter Notebook only.&lt;u&gt;Telemetry will **not** be collected for any use of the Python SDK outside of a Jupyter Notebook.&lt;/u&gt;Telemetry data helps the SDK team understand how the SDK is used so it can be improved and the information about failures helps the team resolve problems and fix bugs.The SDK telemetry feature is enabled by default for Jupyter Notebook usage and cannot be enabled for non-Jupyter scenarios. To opt out of the telemetry feature in a Jupyter scenario, pass in `enable_telemetry=False` when constructing your MLClient object.## Next steps- View our [samples][ml_samples].## ContributingThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions.

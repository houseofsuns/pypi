	<longdescription># PIHAT Widgets## AboutThe purpose of this module is to provide a set of programmable visual gadgets designed to make learning programming more fun.Rather than just creating data and displaying text on the screen you can create traffic light sequences or display number countdown sequences or even create your own color pixelated grid.The module contains three gadgets- LedMatrix- TrafficLight- LEDCharacter- LEDMultiCharacter## DetailsAll control have to be called from within the scope of a main clause:``` def main():       # Do something with a pihat controlif __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    main()```### Safely creating widgetsWhen you create a widget you should always call the close() method when you are complete otherwise the widget may continue to display on the screen.```light = TrafficLight()light.set_state(&quot;100&quot;)light.close()```Another way to do the same thing that will automatically close the widget would be to do this instead:```with TrafficLight() as light:    light.set_state(&quot;100&quot;)```### LedMatrixDisplays an LED grid of lights. The colour of each light can be controlled using an RGB tuple```if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    import pihat_widget as ph    import time    # Create the Matrix with 8 rows and columns at screen pos 5, 5 (x, y)    matrix = ph.LEDMatrix(rows = 8, cols = 8, origin_x = 5, origin_y = 5)    matrix.clear() # Clear all pixels    red_color = 255, 0, 0 # RGB red    black_color = 0, 0, 0 # RGB Black    # Set the pixel at (x, y) pos 0, 0 the RGB color red    matrix.set_pixel(x = 0, y = 0, color =  red_color)    time.sleep(5) # Sleep for 5 seconds    matrix.set_pixel(x = 0, y = 0, color =  black_color)    matrix.set_pixel(x=0, y=1, color=red_color)    time.sleep(3)    matrix.close()``````#### set_pixel(x, y , color)Sets the color of a pixel. color is an rgb tuple#### set_pixels(matrix)Pass a two dimensional array or rgb color tuplesFor a 2 x 2 board the top left pixel would be yellow and the bottom right red.The other pixels would be black```matrix = [ [ (255,255,0), (0, 0, 0) ], [(0, 0, 0), (255,0,0)  ]]board.set_pixels(matrix)``` To simplify the tuple you could also code:```matrix = [ [ (255,255,0), 0 ], [0, 255]]board.set_pixels(matrix)```#### set_pixels_color(matrix, color)Pass a two dimensional array of bit flags and a color parameter.For a 2 x 2 board the top left pixel would be yellow and the bottom right red.The other pixels would be black```matrix = [ [ 1, 0 ], [0, 1]]board.set_pixels_color(matrix, (255,0, 0))```### TrafficLight```if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    import pihat_widget as ph    import time    light = ph.TrafficLight()    count =0    while count&lt;1:        light.set_state(&quot;100&quot;)        time.sleep(5)        light.set_state(&quot;110&quot;)        time.sleep(2.7)        light.set_state(&quot;001&quot;)        time.sleep(5)        light.set_state(&quot;010&quot;)        time.sleep(2.7)        count+=1    light.close()```### LEDCharacterCreates a single character segmented numeric display.Set the number property to display the number ```if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    import pihat_widget as ph    import time    c = ph.LEDCharacter(x = 150, y = 150)    for i in range(10):        c.Number = i        time.sleep(0.5)    time.sleep(3)    c.close() ```### LEDMultiCharacter Creates a multi character segmented numeric display. Set the number property to display the number ```if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    import pihat_widget as ph    import time    c = ph.LEDMultiCharacter(digits = 3, y=120)    for i in range(105):        c.Number =i    c.close() ```</longdescription>

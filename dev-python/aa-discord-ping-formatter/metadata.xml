To do so you can enable it via:```python## AA Discord Ping FormatterAA_DISCORDFORMATTER_WEBHOOK_EMBED_PING = True```### Adding Ping TargetsPer default you have 2 ping targets you can select from. That's `@everyone` and `@here`. If you need more than these 2, you can add them to your `local.py` and override the default behaviour that way.Open your `local.py` in an editor of your choice and add the following at the end.```python## AA Discord Ping FormatterAA_DISCORDFORMATTER_ADDITIONAL_PING_TARGETS = [    {        'roleId': 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',        'roleName': 'Member'    },    {        # restricted to &quot;Capital FCs&quot; (GroupID 5) and &quot;Super Capital FCs&quot; (GroupID 7)        'restrictedToGroup': [            5,            7,        ],        'roleId': 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',        'roleName': 'Capital Pilots'    },]```To get the `roleId` go to your Discord Server Settings » Roles and right click the role you need and copy the ID. You might need to activate the Developer Mode for your Discord account in order to do so. You activate the Developmer Mode in your account settings under Appearance » Advanced » Developer Mode.**Important:** Both, `roleId` and `roleName` need to be without the `@`, it will be added automatically. `roleName` needs to be spelled exactly as it is on Discord.### Adding Fleet TypesPer default you have 4 fleet types you can select from. That's `Roam`, `Home Defense`, `StratOP` and `CTA`. If you need more than these 4, you can add them to your `local.py` and override the default behaviour that way.Open your `local.py` in an editor of your choice and add the following at the end.```python## AA Discord Ping FormatterAA_DISCORDFORMATTER_ADDITIONAL_FLEET_TYPES = [    # example for embedded webhook pings    {        'fleetType': 'Mining',        'embedColor': '#4F545C' # can be empty but needs to be set. Needs to be #hex and 6 digits    },    # example for non embedded webhook pings    'Ratting',]```Both examples will work, no matter if you have `AA_DISCORDFORMATTER_WEBHOOK_EMBED_PING` enabled or not. But keep in mind, to set a custom color for your embed, it needs to be defined like in the first example. The color needs to be your standard hex color code like you define it in (for example) CSS as well. Pre-defined fleet types are by default: Roam = green, Home Defense = yellow, StratOP = orange, CTA = red### Adding Ping ChannelsPer default, your ping will just be formatted for you to copy and paste. But, if your FCs are too lazy even for that, you can configure webhooks. One for each channel you might want to ping.Open your `local.py` in an editor of your choice and add the following at the end.```python## AA Discord Ping FormatterAA_DISCORDFORMATTER_ADDITIONAL_PING_WEBHOOKS = [    {        'discordChannelName': 'Fleet Pings (#fleet-pings)',        'discordWebhookUrl': 'https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy'    },    {        'discordChannelName': 'Pre Pings (#pre-pings)',        'discordWebhookUrl': 'https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy'    },    {        # restricted to &quot;Capital FCs&quot; (GroupID 5) and &quot;Super Capital FCs&quot; (GroupID 7)        'restrictedToGroup': [            5,            7,        ],        'discordChannelName': 'Capital Pings (#capital-pings)',        'discordWebhookUrl': 'https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy'    }]```### Fleet Comms, Formup Location and DoctrineValues for Fleet Comms, Formup Location and Doctrine can be pre-defined as suggestions, so your FCs have a quick selection of the most used comms, stagings and doctrines to select from. These are not fixed values in the form, since we use a combination of input and select fields here. So FCs are absolutely free to something completely different in those 3 fields than the pre-defined suggestions.To define these 3 fields, open your `local.py` in an editor of your choice and add the following:Fleet Comms```python## AA Discord Ping FormatterAA_DISCORDFORMATTER_FLEET_COMMS = [    'Alliance Mumble',    'Coalition Mumble',    'Spy Account Mumble' # :-P]```Fleet Staging```python## AA Discord Ping FormatterAA_DISCORDFORMATTER_FLEET_FORMUP_LOCATIONS = [    'Alliance Staging System',    'Coalition Staging System']```Doctrine```python## AA Discord Ping FormatterAA_DISCORDFORMATTER_FLEET_DOCTRINES = [    'Battle Skiffs',    'Combat Nereus',    'Attack Corvettes']```</longdescription>

Deprecate buildout in favour of pip.#. Move settings into a projects directory to avoid clutter.#. Minimum supported version of `jmbo-foundry` is now 2.0.#. All configs massively reworked.#. local_settings.py support.#. Add documentation.0.9---#. Deprecate haproxy since a load balancer at another point in the chain does a better job.0.8---#. `setup-server.sh` gets optional arguments for a leaner install.#. `deploy-project.sh` does not lead to downtime anymore.#. Haproxy config does not need both basic and smart backends for mobi anymore.#. Remove media-links from configs. It is redundant.#. Use gunicorn in way advised by Django.#. Install `device-proxy` through pip from pypi.#. Admin runs on its own instance. This enables us to set longer timeouts to handle the more expensive queries.#. Mobile browsers are automatically directed to mobi now. They have the option of requesting the desktop site.0.7.1-----#. Bump `jmbo-foundry` to 1.1.10.#. Bump `jmbo-downloads` to 0.0.5.#. Fix bug in `deploy-script.sh`.0.7---#. Up `jmbo-foundry` to 1.1.9.#. Media directories are now prefixed with the app name. This allows multiple Jmbo projects to live on the same server.#. Simplify `create-jmbo-project.sh` by removing an option.#. Force buildout 1.7.0 since version 2 has backward incompatible changes.0.6---#. `device-proxy` and haproxy is now part of our setup. This enables user-agent to backend mapping.#. Buildouts massively refactored. Everything can be regenerated using `create-project.sh`. `STATIC_URL` changes for basic and smart layers.0.5.2-----#. `south` lowercase pin added.#. `deploy-project.sh` now creates necessary cron entries.#. Sentry is now part of our setup.0.5.1-----#. `setup-development.sh` makes getting a development environment running easy.0.5---#. Demo now uses location aware SQLite database.#. versions.cfg is updated from this version onwards.#. Up jmbo-foundry to 1.0, and jmbo to 1.0 since we now use a location aware database by default.0.4.4-----#. Up jmbo-foundry to 0.7.2.#. There are now four sites since page layouts may differ between eg. basic and smart.0.4.3-----#. Up django-setuptest to 0.1.2.#. Up jmbo-foundry to 0.7.1.#. Copy .gitignore when creating a new project.0.4.1-----#. Webdav access now enabled. It is useful for changing CSS on QA sites on the fly.#. Webdav requires we backup static resources on each deploy. Added to deploy_project.sh.#. Removed Praekelt assumption from deploy script.#. Up required jmbo-foundry to 0.6.3. Django 1.4 is now implicitly required.#. Up djangorecipe to 1.2.1 and handle case where Django name is suddenly case-sensitive when pinning.0.4---#. Up minimum jmbo-foundry to 0.5.#. Create a trivial south migration so order of migrations is correct.0.3.2-----#. Dev buildout now uses git instead of https.0.3.1-----#. Remove flup since it is currently broken. #. Create different sites for mobi and web.0.3---#. Templates for mid and smart layers.#. Server setup bug fixes.0.2.4-----#. Fix manifest and up minimum jmbo-foundry to 0.4.0.2.2-----#.

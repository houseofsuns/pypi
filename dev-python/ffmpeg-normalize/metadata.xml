It can also perform RMS-based normalization (where the mean is lifted or attenuated), or peak normalization to a certain target level.Batch processing of several input files is possible, including video files.**A very quick how-to:**1. Install a recent version of [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)2. Run `pip3 install ffmpeg-normalize`3. Run `ffmpeg-normalize /path/to/your/file.mp4`4. Done! 🎧 (the file will be in a folder called `normalized`)Read on for more info.**Contents:**- [Requirements](#requirements)  - [ffmpeg](#ffmpeg)- [Installation](#installation)- [Usage](#usage)- [Description](#description)- [Examples](#examples)- [Detailed Options](#detailed-options)  - [File Input/Output](#file-inputoutput)  - [General](#general)  - [Normalization](#normalization)  - [EBU R128 Normalization](#ebu-r128-normalization)  - [Audio Encoding](#audio-encoding)  - [Other Encoding Options](#other-encoding-options)  - [Input/Output Format](#inputoutput-format)  - [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)- [API](#api)- [FAQ](#faq)  - [The program doesn't work because the &quot;loudnorm&quot; filter can't be found](#the-program-doesnt-work-because-the-loudnorm-filter-cant-be-found)  - [Should I use this to normalize my music collection?](#should-i-use-this-to-normalize-my-music-collection)  - [Why are my output files MKV?](#why-are-my-output-files-mkv)  - [&quot;Could not write header for output file&quot; error](#could-not-write-header-for-output-file-error)  - [The conversion does not work and I get a cryptic ffmpeg error!](#the-conversion-does-not-work-and-i-get-a-cryptic-ffmpeg-error)  - [What are the different normalization algorithms?](#what-are-the-different-normalization-algorithms)  - [Couldn't I just run `loudnorm` with ffmpeg?](#couldnt-i-just-run-loudnorm-with-ffmpeg)  - [What about speech?](#what-about-speech)  - [After updating, this program does not work as expected anymore!](#after-updating-this-program-does-not-work-as-expected-anymore)  - [Can I buy you a beer / coffee / random drink?](#can-i-buy-you-a-beer--coffee--random-drink)- [Related Tools and Articles](#related-tools-and-articles)- [Contributors](#contributors)- [License](#license)-------------## RequirementsYou need Python 3.8 or higher.### ffmpeg- ffmpeg 5.x is required, ffmpeg 6.x is recommended (it fixes [a bug for short files](https://github.com/slhck/ffmpeg-normalize/issues/87))- Download a [static build](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) for your system- Place the `ffmpeg` executable in your `$PATH`, or specify the path to the binary with the `FFMPEG_PATH` environment variable in `ffmpeg-normalize`For instance, under Linux:```bashwget https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/releases/ffmpeg-release-amd64-static.tar.xzmkdir -p ffmpegtar -xf ffmpeg-release-amd64-static.tar.xz -C ffmpeg --strip-components=1sudo cp ffmpeg/ffmpeg /usr/local/binsudo cp ffmpeg/ffprobe /usr/local/binsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg /usr/local/bin/ffprobe```For Windows, follow [this guide](https://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows).For macOS and Linux, you can also use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):```bashbrew install ffmpeg```Note that using distribution packages (e.g., `apt install ffmpeg`) is not recommended, as these are often outdated.## InstallationFor Python 3 and pip:```bashpip3 install ffmpeg-normalize```Or download this repository, then run `pip3 install .`.## Docker BuildDownload this repository and run```docker build -t ffmpeg-normalize .```Run using Windows Powershell or Linux:```docker run  -v &quot;$(pwd):/tmp&quot; -it ffmpeg-normalize /bin/sh```This will mount your current folder to the /tmp directory inside the containerNote: The container will run in interactive mode.Example Usage:```PS C:\yonkers&gt; docker run  -v &quot;$(pwd):/tmp&quot; -it ffmpeg-normalize /bin/sh/ # cd /tmp/tmp # ls01. Goblin.mp3/tmp # ffmpeg-normalize &quot;01. Goblin.mp3&quot; -f -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 320k --target-level -13 --output &quot;01. Goblin normalized.mp3&quot;WARNING: The chosen output extension mp3 does not support video/cover art. It will be disabled./tmp # ls01. Goblin normalized.mp301. Goblin.mp3```## Usage```bashffmpeg-normalize input [input ...][-h][-o OUTPUT [OUTPUT ...]] [options]```Example:```bashffmpeg-normalize 1.wav 2.wav -o 1-normalized.m4a 2-normalized.m4a -c:a aac -b:a 192k```For more information on the options (`[options]`) available, run `ffmpeg-normalize -h`, or read on.## DescriptionPlease read this section for a high level introduction.**What does the program do?**The program takes one or more input files and, by default, writes them to a folder called `normalized`, using an `.mkv` container. All audio streams will be normalized so that they have the same (perceived) volume.**How do I specify the input?**Just give the program one or more input files as arguments. It works with most media files.**How do I specify the output?**You can specify one output file name for each input file with the `-o` option. In this case, the container format (e.g. `.wav`) will be inferred from the file name extension that you've given.Example:```ffmpeg-normalize 1.wav 2.wav -o 1n.wav 2n.wav```If you don't specify the output file name for an input file, the container format will be MKV, and the output will be written to `normalized/&lt;input&gt;.mkv`.Using the `-ext` option, you can supply a different output extension common to all output files, e.g. `-ext m4a`.**What will get normalized?**By default, all streams from the input file will be written to the output file. For example, if your input is a video with two language tracks and a subtitle track, both audio tracks will be normalized independently. The video and subtitle tracks will be copied over to the output file.**How will the normalization be done?**The normalization will be performed with the [`loudnorm` filter](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#loudnorm) from FFmpeg, which was [originally written by Kyle Swanson](https://k.ylo.ph/2016/04/04/loudnorm.html). It will bring the audio to a specified target level. This ensures that multiple files normalized with this filter will have the same perceived loudness.**What codec is chosen?**The default audio encoding method is uncompressed PCM (`pcm_s16le`) to avoid introducing compression artifacts. This will result in a much higher bitrate than you might want, for example if your input files are MP3s.Some containers (like MP4) also cannot handle PCM audio. If you want to use such containers and/or keep the file size down, use `-c:a` and specify an audio codec (e.g., `-c:a aac` for ffmpeg's built-in AAC encoder).## Examples[Read the examples on the wiki.](https://github.com/slhck/ffmpeg-normalize/wiki/examples)## Detailed Options### File Input/Output- `input`: Input media file(s)- `-o OUTPUT [OUTPUT ...], --output OUTPUT [OUTPUT ...]`: Output file names.    Will be applied per input file.    If no output file name is specified for an input file, the output files    will be written to the default output folder with the name `&lt;input&gt;.&lt;ext&gt;`, where `&lt;ext&gt;` is the output extension (see `-ext` option).    Example: `ffmpeg-normalize 1.wav 2.wav -o 1n.wav 2n.wav`- `-of OUTPUT_FOLDER, --output-folder OUTPUT_FOLDER`: Output folder (default: `normalized`)    This folder will be used for input files that have no explicit output name specified.### General- `-f, --force`: Force overwrite existing files- `-d, --debug`: Print debugging output- `-v, --verbose`: Print verbose output- `-q, --quiet`: Only print errors- `-n, --dry-run`: Do not run normalization, only print what would be done- `-pr`, `--progress`: Show progress bar for files and streams- `--version`: Print version and exit### Normalization- `-nt {ebu,rms,peak}, --normalization-type {ebu,rms,peak}`: Normalization type (default: `ebu`).    EBU normalization performs two passes and normalizes according to EBU R128.    RMS-based normalization brings the input file to the specified RMS level.    Peak normalization brings the signal to the specified peak level.- `-t TARGET_LEVEL, --target-level TARGET_LEVEL`: Normalization target level in dB/LUFS (default: -23).    For EBU normalization, it corresponds to Integrated Loudness Target in LUFS. The range is -70.0 - -5.0.    Otherwise, the range is -99 to 0.- `-p, --print-stats`: Print first pass loudness statistics formatted as JSON to stdout.### EBU R128 Normalization- `-lrt LOUDNESS_RANGE_TARGET, --loudness-range-target LOUDNESS_RANGE_TARGET`: EBU Loudness Range Target in LUFS (default: 7.0).    Range is 1.0 - 50.0.- `--keep-loudness-range-target`: Keep the input loudness range target to allow for linear normalization.- `--keep-lra-above-loudness-range-target`: Keep input loudness range above loudness range target.  - `LOUDNESS_RANGE_TARGET` for input loudness range `&lt;= LOUDNESS_RANGE_TARGET` or  - keep input loudness range target above `LOUDNESS_RANGE_TARGET`.  as alternative to `--keep-loudness-range-target` to allow for linear normalization.- `-tp TRUE_PEAK, --true-peak TRUE_PEAK`: EBU Maximum True Peak in dBTP (default: -2.0).    Range is -9.0 - +0.0.- `--offset OFFSET`: EBU Offset Gain (default: 0.0).    The gain is applied before the true-peak limiter in the first pass only. The offset for the second pass will be automatically determined based on the first pass statistics.    Range is -99.0 - +99.0.- `--dual-mono`: Treat mono input files as &quot;dual-mono&quot;.    If a mono file is intended for playback on a stereo system, its EBU R128 measurement will be perceptually incorrect. If set, this option will compensate for this effect. Multi-channel input files are not affected by this option.- `--dynamic`: Force dynamic normalization mode.    Instead of applying linear EBU R128 normalization, choose a dynamic normalization. This is not usually recommended.    Dynamic mode will automatically change the sample rate to 192 kHz. Use -ar/--sample-rate to specify a different output sample rate.### Audio Encoding- `-c:a AUDIO_CODEC, --audio-codec AUDIO_CODEC`: Audio codec to use for output files.    See `ffmpeg -encoders` for a list.    Will use PCM audio with input stream bit depth by default.- `-b:a AUDIO_BITRATE, --audio-bitrate AUDIO_BITRATE`: Audio bitrate in bits/s, or with K suffix.    If not specified, will use codec default.- `-ar SAMPLE_RATE, --sample-rate SAMPLE_RATE`: Audio sample rate to use for output files in Hz.    Will use input sample rate by default, except for EBU normalization, which will change the input sample rate to 192 kHz.- `-koa, --keep-original-audio`: Copy original, non-normalized audio streams to output file- `-prf PRE_FILTER, --pre-filter PRE_FILTER`: Add an audio filter chain before applying normalization.    Multiple filters can be specified by comma-separating them.- `-pof POST_FILTER, --post-filter POST_FILTER`: Add an audio filter chain after applying normalization.    Multiple filters can be specified by comma-separating them.    For EBU, the filter will be applied during the second pass.### Other Encoding Options- `-vn, --video-disable`: Do not write video streams to output- `-c:v VIDEO_CODEC, --video-codec VIDEO_CODEC`: Video codec to use for output files (default: 'copy').    See `ffmpeg -encoders` for a list.    Will attempt to copy video codec by default.- `-sn, --subtitle-disable`: Do not write subtitle streams to output- `-mn, --metadata-disable`: Do not write metadata to output- `-cn, --chapters-disable`: Do not write chapters to output### Input/Output Format- `-ei EXTRA_INPUT_OPTIONS, --extra-input-options EXTRA_INPUT_OPTIONS`: Extra input options list.    A list of extra ffmpeg command line arguments valid for the input, applied before ffmpeg's `-i`.    You can either use a JSON-formatted list (i.e., a list of comma-separated, quoted elements within square brackets), or a simple string of space-separated arguments.    If JSON is used, you need to wrap the whole argument in quotes to prevent shell expansion and to preserve literal quotes inside the string. If a simple string is used, you need to specify the argument with `-e=`.    Examples: `-ei '[ &quot;-f&quot;, &quot;mpegts&quot;, &quot;-r&quot;, &quot;24&quot; ]'` or `-ei=&quot;-f mpegts -r 24&quot;`- `-e EXTRA_OUTPUT_OPTIONS, --extra-output-options EXTRA_OUTPUT_OPTIONS`: Extra output options list.    A list of extra ffmpeg command line arguments valid for the output.    You can either use a JSON-formatted list (i.e., a list of comma-separated, quoted elements within square brackets), or a simple string of space-separated arguments.    If JSON is used, you need to wrap the whole argument in quotes to prevent shell expansion and to preserve literal quotes inside the string. If a simple string is used, you need to specify the argument with `-e=`.    Examples: `-e '[ &quot;-vbr&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;-preset:v&quot;, &quot;ultrafast&quot; ]'` or `-e=&quot;-vbr 3 -preset:v ultrafast&quot;`- `-ofmt OUTPUT_FORMAT, --output-format OUTPUT_FORMAT`: Media format to use for output file(s).    See `ffmpeg -formats` for a list.    If not specified, the format will be inferred by ffmpeg from the output file name. If the output file name is not explicitly specified, the extension will govern the format (see '--extension' option).- `-ext EXTENSION, --extension EXTENSION`: Output file extension to use for output files that were not explicitly specified. (Default: `mkv`)### Environment VariablesThe program additionally respects environment variables:- `TMP` / `TEMP` / `TMPDIR`    Sets the path to the temporary directory in which files are    stored before being moved to the final output directory.    Note: You need to use full paths.- `FFMPEG_PATH`    Sets the full path to an `ffmpeg` executable other than    the system default or you can provide a file name available on $PATH## APIThis program has a simple API that can be used to integrate it into other Python programs.For more information see the [API documentation](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/slhck/ffmpeg-normalize/blob/master/docs/ffmpeg_normalize.html).## FAQ### The program doesn't work because the &quot;loudnorm&quot; filter can't be foundMake sure you run a recent ffmpeg version and that `loudnorm` is part of the output when you run `ffmpeg -filters`. Many distributions package outdated ffmpeg versions, or (even worse), Libav's `ffmpeg` disguising as a real `ffmpeg` from the FFmpeg project.Some ffmpeg builds also do not have the `loudnorm` filter enabled.You can always download a static build from [their website](http://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and use that.If you have to use an outdated ffmpeg version, you can only use `rms` or `peak` as normalization types, but I can't promise that the program will work correctly.### Should I use this to normalize my music collection?When you run `ffmpeg-normalize` and re-encode files with MP3 or AAC, you will inevitably introduce [generation loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_loss). Therefore, I do not recommend running this on your precious music collection, unless you have a backup of the originals or accept potential quality reduction. If you just want to normalize the subjective volume of the files without changing the actual content, consider using [MP3Gain](http://mp3gain.sourceforge.net/) and [aacgain](http://aacgain.altosdesign.com/).### Why are my output files MKV?I chose MKV as a default output container since it handles almost every possible combination of audio, video, and subtitle codecs. If you know which audio/video codec you want, and which container is supported, use the output options to specify the encoder and output file name manually.### &quot;Could not write header for output file&quot; errorSee the [next section](#the-conversion-does-not-work-and-i-get-a-cryptic-ffmpeg-error).### The conversion does not work and I get a cryptic ffmpeg error!Maybe ffmpeg says something like:&gt; Could not write header for output file #0 (incorrect codec parameters ?): Invalid argumentOr the program says:&gt; … Please choose a suitable audio codec with the `-c:a` option.One possible reason is that the input file contains some streams that cannot be mapped to the output file, or that you are using a codec that does not work for the output file. Examples:- You are trying to normalize a movie file, writing to a `.wav` or `.mp3` file. WAV/MP3 files only support audio, not video. Disable video and subtitles with `-vn` and `-sn`, or choose a container that supports video (e.g. `.mkv`).- You are trying to normalize a file, writing to an `.mp4` container. This program defaults to PCM audio, but MP4 does not support PCM audio. Make sure that your audio codec is set to something MP4 containers support (e.g. `-c:a aac`).The default output container is `.mkv` as it will support most input stream types. If you want a different output container, [make sure that it supports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_container_file_formats) your input file's video, audio, and subtitle streams (if any).Also, if there is some other broken metadata, you can try to disable copying over of metadata with `-mn`.Finally, make sure you use a recent version of ffmpeg. The [static builds](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) are usually the best option.### What are the different normalization algorithms?- **EBU R128** is an EBU standard that is commonly used in the broadcasting world. The normalization is performed using a psychoacoustic model that targets a subjective loudness level measured in LUFS (Loudness Unit Full Scale). R128 is subjectively more accurate than any peak or RMS-based normalization. More info on R128 can be found in the [official document](https://tech.ebu.ch/docs/r/r128.pdf) and [the `loudnorm` filter description](http://k.ylo.ph/2016/04/04/loudnorm.html) by its original author.- **Peak Normalization** analyzes the peak signal level in dBFS and increases the volume of the input signal such that the maximum in the output is 0 dB (or any other chosen threshold). Since spikes in the signal can cause high volume peaks, peak normalization might still result in files that are subjectively quieter than other, non-peak-normalized files.- **RMS-based Normalization** analyzes the [RMS power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_square#Average_power) of the signal and changes the volume such that a new RMS target is reached. Otherwise it works similar to peak normalization.### Couldn't I just run `loudnorm` with ffmpeg?You absolutely can. However, you can get better accuracy and linear normalization with two passes of the filter. Since ffmpeg does not allow you to automatically run these two passes, you have to do it yourself and parse the output values from the first run.If ffmpeg-normalize is too over-engineered for you, you could also use an approach such as featured [in this Ruby script](https://gist.github.com/kylophone/84ba07f6205895e65c9634a956bf6d54) that performs the two `loudnorm` passes.If you want dynamic normalization (the loudnorm default), simply use ffmpeg with one pass, e.g.:```bashffmpeg -i input.mp3 -af loudnorm -c:a aac -b:a 192k output.m4a```### What about speech?You should check out the `speechnorm` filter that is part of ffmpeg. It is a designed to be used in one pass, so you don't need this script at all.See [the documentation](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-all.html#speechnorm) for more information.### After updating, this program does not work as expected anymore!You are probably using a 0.x version of this program. There are significant changes to the command line arguments and inner workings of this program, so please  adapt your scripts to the new one. Those changes were necessary to address a few issues that kept piling up; leaving the program as-is would have made it hard to extend it. You can continue using the old version (find it under *Releases* on GitHub or request the specific version from PyPi), but it will not be supported anymore.### Can I buy you a beer / coffee / random drink?If you found this program useful and feel like giving back, feel free to send a donation [via PayPal](https://paypal.me/WernerRobitza).## Related Tools and Articles- [Create an AppleScript application to drop or open a folder of files in ffmpeg-normalize](https://prehensileblog.wordpress.com/2022/04/15/create-an-applescript-application-to-drop-or-open-a-folder-of-files-in-ffmpeg-normalize/)*(Have a link?

Multiprocessing is not available in all environments, for example  on AWS lambda python run time lacks /dev/shm, so trying to acquire  a multiprocessing Lock throws an OSError. The module could also be  missing in some cases (ex. Jython, although this library doesn't support  Jython anyway).  The solution to this is to only try to set the lock when multiprocessing  is available. The tqdm library solves this in the same manner.

Add extended normalisation options* Add extended normalisation options.  - add program option to write output in a separate directory in stead of     prefixing it  - add program option to merge the normalized audio in the original     (video) file rather than creating a separate WAV file  - change the maximum setting: will now normalize so that max     volume is set to 0, adjusted with the given level.     e.g. : -m -l -5 will increase the audio level to max = -5.0dB  - improve verbose logging: number of files are written to the     info log  - improve performance: check first whether the output file     exists before calculating the volume levels + not modifying     the file if the adjustment &lt; 0.5dB (level is never exactly 0)* Update README, fixes #11.## v0.1.3 (2015-12-15)* Check for Windows .exe, fixes #10.* Check path and fix #9.* Merge pull request #8 from benjaoming/master.  Add MANIFEST.in* Bump version.* Add manifest to include missing files in sdist.* Merge pull request #6 from jetpks/master.  Fixed ffmpeg v2.6.3 compatibility and docopt config* Updated to work with ffmpeg v2.6.3, and fixed broken docopt config.  ffmpeg update:  ffmpeg v2.6.3 puts mean_volume on stderr instead of stdout, causing  `output` in `ffmpeg_get_mean` to be completely empty, and no match for  mean_volume or max_volume to be found.  Fixed by adding `stderr=subprocess.PIPE` in both Popen calls in  `run_command`, and combining stdout and stderr on return. We already  exit with non-zero return, so combining stderr/stdout shouldn't cause  any poor side-effects.  docopt config:  - args['--level'] was not recognizing its default because there was    an errant comma between -l and --level, and it needed &lt;level&gt; after    the arguments.  - Fixed spacing for --max  - Removed quotes around 'normalized' so single quote characters don't    end up in the output file names.* Removed Windows carraige returns from __main__.py.* Merge pull request #5 from mvbattista/master.

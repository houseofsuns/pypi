DCRX-API extends dcrx, providing integrations with the Docker API and dcrx that allow images to be built by making REST requests.DCRX-API also includes basic JWT authorization and user management (no-RBAC), and is intended to be deployed as an internal-facing service. dcrx also provides OpenAPI documentation to make getting started intuitive, and features integrations with SQLite, Postgres, and MySQL for storing and managing users.# Setup and InstallationDCRX-API is available both as a Docker image and as a PyPi package. For local use, we recommend using PyPi, Python 3.10+, and a virtual environment. To install, run:```bashpython -m venv ~/.dcrx &amp;&amp; \source ~/.dcrx/bin/activate &amp;&amp; \pip install dcrx-api```To get the Docker image, run:```docker pull adalundhe/dcrx-api:latest```# Getting StartedDCRX-API requires a slew of environmental variables in order to run correctly. These include:```DCRX_API_JOB_TIMEOUT=10m # The maximum amount of time before an image build + push job times out and is cancelled. Default is 10 minutes.DCRX_API_MAX_MEMORY_PERCENT_USAGE=50 # The percent of system memory DCRX-API and Docker image builds created by DCRX-API can use. If exceeded, new jobs will be rejected and requests will return a 400 error. Default is 50 percent.DCRX_API_JOB_PRUNE_INTERVAL='1s' # How often dcrx-api checks for done, failed, or cancelled jobs to remove from in-memory storage.DCRX_API_JOB_MAX_AGE='1m'= # Time before done, failed, or cancelled jobs are pruned from in-memory storage.DCRX_API_JOB_MAX_PENDING_WAIT=10m # The maximum amount of time a job can remain in PENDING status. Jobs that exceed this threshold are timed out and will fail.DCRX_API_JOB_MAX_PENDING=100 # The maximum number of pending jobs that a single instance of DCRX-API allows. Default is 100.DCRX_API_JOB_POOL_SIZE=10 # Maximum number of concurrent builds. Default is 10.DCRX_API_JOB_WORKERS=4 # Number of workers to use per-job. Default is the number os OS threads.DCRX_API_TOKEN_EXPIRATION='15m' # Time for JWT authorization token to expire. Default is 15 minutes.DCRX_API_SECRET_KEY=testingthis # Initial secret used to hash user passwords.DCRX_API_AUTH_ALGORITHM=HS256 # Algorithm to use for hashing user passwords.DCRX_API_DATABASE_TRANSACTION_RETRIES=3 # Number of times to retry a failed transaction. Default is 3.DCRX_API_DATABASE_TYPE=sqlite # Type of database to use. Default is sqlite and options are mysql, asyncpg, and sqlite.DCRX_API_DATABASE_USER=admin # Username used for database connection authenticationDCRX_API_DATABASE_PASSWORD=test1234 # Password used for database connection authentricationDCRX_API_DATABASE_NAME=dcrx # Name of database to use for storing users. Default is dcrx.DCRX_API_DATABASE_URI=sqlite+aiosqlite:///dcrx # URL/URI of SQL database for storing users and job metadata.DCRX_API_DATABASE_PORT=3369 # Port of SQL database for storing users and job metadata.```Prior to starting the server, we recommend seeding the database with an initial user. To do so, run the command:```bashdcrx-api database initialize --username $USERNAME --password $PASSWORD --first-name $FIRST_NAME --last-name $LAST_NAME --email $EMAIL```If you've chosen to run the Docker image, this step is taken care of for you, with the default user being:```username: adminpassword: dcrxadmin1*first-name: adminlast-name: useremail: admin@admin.com```Next run:```bashdcrx-api server run```and navigate to `localhost:2277/docs`, where you'll find dcrx-api's OpenAPI documentation.# Authenticating and Building an ImageFrom here, we'll need to authenticate using the initial user we created above. Open the tab for `/users/login`, and for the `username` and `password` fields enter the username and password of the initial user, then click `Execute`. A `200` status response containg the initial user's username and id should return.Before creating and pushing any images, we need to create a Registry. Navigate to the `/registry/create` tab. We'll need to provide a `registry_name` (unique shortand reference of our choosing), `registry_uri` (HTTP url to the registry), `registry_user`, and `registry_password:```json{  &quot;registry_name&quot;: &quot;hello-world&quot;,  &quot;registry_uri&quot;: &quot;https://docker.io/v1/testreg/hello-world&quot;,  &quot;registry_user&quot;: &quot;testuser&quot;,  &quot;registry_password&quot;: &quot;testpassword1*&quot;}```Submit the request. DCRX-API will take the information, encrypt the registry password, and store it.Next navigate to the `/jobs/images/create` tab. As before, we'll need to fill out some data. Go ahead and copy paste the below into the input for the request body:```json{  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;testreg/hello-world&quot;,  &quot;tag&quot;: &quot;latest&quot;,  &quot;registry&quot;: {    &quot;registry_name&quot;: &quot;hello-world&quot;  },  &quot;layers&quot;: [    {      &quot;layer_type&quot;: &quot;stage&quot;,      &quot;base&quot;: &quot;python&quot;,      &quot;tag&quot;: &quot;3.11-slim&quot;    },    {        &quot;layer_type&quot;: &quot;entrypoint&quot;,        &quot;command&quot;: [            &quot;echo&quot;,            &quot;Hello world!&quot;        ]    }  ]}```A dcrx-api image build request requires, at-minimum, a `name`, `tag`, `registry_name`, and one or more `layer` objects, which will be processed and build in-order of appearance. Note that each layer object almost exactly corresponds to its `dcrx` call. The above corresponds exactly to:```pythonfrom dcrx import Imagehello_world = Image('hello-world')hello_world.stage(    'python',    '3.11-slim').entrypoint([    'echo',    'Hello world!'])```Go ahead and submit the request via the `Execute` button. This will start a job to build the specified image and push it to the repository specified in the request.Note that dcrx-api doesn't wait for the image to be built, instead returning a `JobMetadata` response with a status code of `200`, including the `job_id`. Building images is time-intensive and could potentially bog down a server, so dcrx-api builds and pushes images in the background. We can use the `job_id` of a Job to make further `GET` requests to the `/jobs/images/{job_id}/get` endpoint to monitor and check how our job is progressing. If we need to cancel a job for any reason, we can simple make a `DELETE` request to `/jobs/images/{job_id}/cancel`.# Running the Docker ImageTo run the Docker image, we recommend first creating a `.env` file with the required environment variables noted above. Then run the image:```bashdocker run -p 2277:2277 --env-file .env --privileged dcrx-api:latest```# Deploying via HelmDCRX-API has a minimal helm chart to help you scale up when ready. To begin, first create a Kuberenetes secret as below:```kubectl create secret generic dcrx-api-secrets --from-literal=&quot;DCRX_API_SECRET_KEY=$DCRX_API_SECRET_KEY&quot; --from-literal=&quot;DOCKER_REGISTRY_USERNAME=$DOCKER_REGISTRY_USERNAME&quot; --from-literal=&quot;DOCKER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=$DOCKER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD&quot;```Then install the provided helm chart:```helm install dcrx-api helm/dcrx-api/ --values helm/dcrx-api/values.yml```The chart creates three replica dcrx-api pods, a LoadBalancer service, and Nginx ingress to get you up and running in your Kubernetes cluster!# Notes and Gotchas1. Does dcrx-api require a volume to run? - Yes. While dcrx-api builds images in-memory, Docker still (frustratingly) requires that a physical file be present in the build directory. This means that, if running dcrx-api in Docker or via Kubernetes, you will need to have a volume with the correct permissions mounted.2. Does the dcrx-api Docker image require root? - Currently yes. The dcrx-api image is based on the latest version of Docker's `dind` image, which runs as and requires root privlidges. We're working on getting the rootless version of `dind` working though!</longdescription>

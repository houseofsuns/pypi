	<longdescription>What is Caterpillar?====================.. image:: https://img.shields.io/travis/Kapiche/caterpillar.svg?style=flat-square    :target: https://travis-ci.org/Kapiche/caterpillar.. image:: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/Kapiche/caterpillar.svg?style=flat-square    :target: https://coveralls.io/r/Kapiche/caterpillarCaterpillar is a pure Python text indexing and analytics library. It is aimed at supporting advanced text and other semi-structured analytics applications that bridge Natural Language Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval and Topic Modelling.Some features include:* pluggable key/value object store for storage (currently only implementation is SQLite)* transaction layer for reading/writing (along with associated locking semantics)* supports searching indexes with some built in scoring algorithm implementations (including TF/IDF)* stores additional data structures for analytics above and beyond traditional information retrieval data structures* has a plugin architecture for quickly accessing the data structures and performing custom analytics* has 100% test coverageQuick Example=============Quick example of using caterpillar below::    import os    import tempfile    from caterpillar.processing.index import IndexWriter, IndexConfig    from caterpillar.processing.schema import TEXT, Schema, NUMERIC    from caterpillar.storage.sqlite import SqliteStorage    index_dir = os.path.join(tempfile.mkdtemp(), &quot;examples&quot;)    with open('caterpillar/test_resources/moby.txt', 'r') as f:        data = f.read()        with IndexWriter(index_dir, IndexConfig(SqliteStorage, Schema(text=TEXT, some_number=NUMERIC))) as writer:            writer.add_document(text=data, some_number=1)Installation============.. code::    pip install caterpillarDocumentation=============The documentation can be found `here &lt;http://caterpillar.readthedocs.org/en/latest/&gt;`_.Roadmap=======Caterpillar is currently in a volatile state, and the next releases are likely to undergo substantial changes in the API.In particular we plan to:* Revamp schema and field design, in order to:    - better merge the core text indexing with extraction of structured information. For example, integrating and indexing documents by both their textual context and entities identified by a named entity extraction approach    - integrate the serialisation of schemas within the transactional lifetimes of IndexWriter objects* Improve locking to allow better support for concurrency when indexing large collections* Support more languages, in particular to allow multilingual indexes with appropriate markup and representation of different languages* Remove the NLTK dependency (great library, but only used for tokenisation)* Better API for completely customising what and how data is extracted from documentsPython Version==============Caterpillar now targets Python 3 only. It is intended to support the two most recent releases of Python for new features. Currently this means we aim to support Python 3.5 and 3.6 only.BDFLs=====* `Kris Rogers &lt;https://github.com/krisrogers/&gt;`_* `Ryan Stuart &lt;https://github.com/rstuart85/&gt;`_* `Sam Hames &lt;https://github.com/SamHames/&gt;`_Contributors============Anyone who is willing! In other words none yet, but we are more then accepting of contributions.Contributing============No code will be merged unless it has 100% test coverage and passes the flake8 linting. We code with a line length of 120 characters (see tox.ini [pep8] section) and we use `py.test &lt;http://pytest.org/&gt;`_ for testing. Tests are in a *test*sub-folder in each package. Tox is configured to run the test suite, reporting unit test passes, coverage and lintingautomatically... code::    # Run the whole test suite:    tox    # Run just the linting checks by specifying a specific test environment:    tox -e flake8    # Pass some arguments to py.test through the tox runner (in this case run only a specific set of tests)    tox -e py35 -- -k test_indexCopyright and License=====================Caterpillar is copyright © 2013 - 2015 Kapiche Limited.

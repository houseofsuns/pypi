	<longdescription>nocasedict - A case-insensitive ordered dictionary for Python=============================================================.. image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/nocasedict.svg    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nocasedict/    :alt: Version on Pypi.. image:: https://github.com/pywbem/nocasedict/workflows/test/badge.svg?branch=master    :target: https://github.com/pywbem/nocasedict/actions/    :alt: Actions status.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/nocasedict/badge/?version=latest    :target: https://readthedocs.org/projects/nocasedict/builds/    :alt: Docs build status (master).. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/github/pywbem/nocasedict/badge.svg?branch=master    :target: https://coveralls.io/github/pywbem/nocasedict?branch=master    :alt: Test coverage (master)Overview--------Class `NocaseDict`_ is a case-insensitive ordered dictionary that preservesthe original lexical case of its keys.Example:.. code-block:: bash    $ python    &gt;&gt;&gt; from nocasedict import NocaseDict    &gt;&gt;&gt; dict1 = NocaseDict({'Alpha': 1, 'Beta': 2})    &gt;&gt;&gt; dict1['ALPHA']  # Lookup by key is case-insensitive    1    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(dict1)  # Keys are returned with the original lexical case    NocaseDict({'Alpha': 1, 'Beta': 2})The `NocaseDict`_ class supports the functionality of the built-in`dict class of Python 3.8`_ on all Python versions it supports withthe following exceptions (and the case-insensitivity of course):* The ``iter..()``, ``view..()`` and ``has_key()`` methods are only present  on Python 2, consistent with the built-in ``dict`` class.* The ``keys()``, ``values()`` and ``items()`` methods return a list on Python 2  and a dictionary view on Python 3, consistent with the built-in ``dict``  class... _dict class of Python 3.8: https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/stdtypes.html#dictThe case-insensitivity is achieved by matching any key values as theircasefolded values. By default, the casefolding is performed with`str.casefold()`_ for unicode string keys and with `bytes.lower()`_ for bytestring keys.The default casefolding can be overridden with a user-defined casefold method... _str.casefold(): https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.casefold.. _bytes.lower(): https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes.lowerFunctionality can be added using mixin classes:* `HashableMixin`_ mixin class: Adds case-insensitive hashability.* `KeyableByMixin`_ mixin generator function: Adds ability to get the key from  an attribute of the value object.Why yet another case-insensitive dictionary: We found that all previouslyexisting case-insensitive dictionary packages on Pypi either had flaws, werenot well maintained, or did not support the Python versions we needed... _dict of Python 2: https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#dict.. _dict of Python 3: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.. _NocaseDict: https://nocasedict.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference.html#nocasedict.NocaseDict.. _HashableMixin: https://nocasedict.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference.html#nocasedict.HashableMixin.. _KeyableByMixin: https://nocasedict.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference.html#nocasedict.KeyableByMixinInstallation------------To install the latest released version of the nocasedict package into youractive Python environment:.. code-block:: bash    $ pip install nocasedictThis will also install any prerequisite Python packages.For more details and alternative ways to install, see `Installation`_... _Installation: https://nocasedict.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html#installationDocumentation-------------* `Documentation &lt;https://nocasedict.readthedocs.io/en/stable/&gt;`_Change History--------------* `Change history &lt;https://nocasedict.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changes.html&gt;`_Contributing------------For information on how to contribute to the nocasedict project, see`Contributing &lt;https://nocasedict.readthedocs.io/en/stable/development.html#contributing&gt;`_.License-------The nocasedict project is provided under the`GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1 &lt;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pywbem/nocasedict/master/LICENSE&gt;`_,or (at your option) any later version.</longdescription>

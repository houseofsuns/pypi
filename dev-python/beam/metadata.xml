Run ``pip install beam`` to download the module.2. Create your ``.beam.ini`` inventory file as below.Inventory~~~~~~~~~The inventory file holds information about your hosting provider(s) and host(s),so beam knows how to contact the relevant API endpoints and what credentials touse. Here's a sample file:.. code::   [special:vendors]   ramnode = https://vpscp.ramnode.com   vendor2 = https://vendor2-panel.com   default = ramnode   [nyc-1]   key = nyc-1_host_key   hash = nyc-1_host_hash   [ams-1]   key = ams-1_host_key   hash = ams-1_host_hash   vendor = vendor2This file defines two hosts, ``nyc-1``, hosted with RamNode, and ``ams-1``,hosted with FlipHost. At the top are the vendor names in a special vendorssection (all other sections are assumed to represent hosts). The format maps avendor name to their base endpoint for the SolusVM API. The ``default``directive indicates the implicit vendor of every host, and must be specified ifmore than one vendor is defined.Each host has its own section. The correct ``key`` and ``hash`` values can beoptained from the SolusVM control panel used by your vendor. If a host is notprovided by the default vendor, a ``vendor`` directive specifies the correctone.Usage-----Beam provides both a Python library for programmatic access to your hosts, anda simple CLI that wraps it in a couple of lines of code.CLI~~~The CLI client can be used to find information about a single host... code::    $ beam --help    usage: beam [-h] [-V]                (-A {boot,reboot,shutdown} | -a ATTRIBUTES [ATTRIBUTES ...])                [host]    A lightweight wrapper for the SolusVM client API.    positional arguments:      host                  the identifier of the host whose information to                            retrieve    optional arguments:      -h, --help            show this help message and exit      -V, --version         show program's version number and exit      -A {boot,reboot,shutdown}, --action {boot,reboot,shutdown}                            an action to execute against the host      -a ATTRIBUTES [ATTRIBUTES ...], --attributes ATTRIBUTES [ATTRIBUTES ...]                            one or more attributes of the host to retrieve    $ beam -a bandwidth.free_percentage nyc-1    0.4983459835    $ beam -a primary_ip lon-1    2604:180:2:32b::498b    $ beam -a is_online memory.used_bytes ams-1    True    34578234983    $ beam -A shutdown nyc-1    OKLibrary~~~~~~~.. code:: python    import beam    # shutdown a specific host    host = beam.host('nyc-1')  # name, key or hash    if host.is_online:        host.shutdown()    # boot all offline hosts    [host.boot() for host in beam.hosts() if not host.is_online]    # get a list of hosts using above 90% of their memory    hosts = [host for host in beam.hosts()             if host.memory.used_percentage &gt; .9]    # get a list of hosts with less than 10 GiB of storage left    hosts = [host for host in beam.hosts()             if host.storage.free_bytes &lt; 1024 ** 3 * 10]Roadmap--------  Generate documentation.-  Increase unit test coverage to 100%, and implement some integration tests.Etymology---------Although &quot;solus&quot; means alone, that's a tad depressing. Solus also conjures upimages of the sun for me. The sun *beam*\ s down - and the name was available onPyPI - so beam it was.</longdescription>

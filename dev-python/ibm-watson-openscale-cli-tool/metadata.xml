The GermanCreditRiskModel sample model is taken from the &quot;Watson Studio, Watson Machine Learning and Watson OpenScale samples&quot;[GitHub repo](https://github.com/IBM/watson-openscale-samples), specifically the IBM Watson OpenScale [tutorials](https://github.com/IBM/watson-openscale-samples).When you run ibm-watson-openscale-cli to deploy and configure the GermanCreditRiskModel, the result will be as if you had run the tutorial notebook appropriatefor your machine learning engine.### Q: What are the formats for the credentials files?A: Each credential file has its own format:Postgres```{  &quot;uri&quot;: &quot;postgres://&lt;USERNAME&gt;:&lt;PASSWORD&gt;@&lt;HOSTNAME&gt;:&lt;PORT&gt;/&lt;DB&gt;&quot;}```IBM Cloud Database for Postgres(ICD)* Copy the Service Credentials from your ICD service instance in IBM CloudDB2```{    &quot;username&quot;: &quot;&lt;USERNAME&gt;&quot;,    &quot;password&quot;: &quot;&lt;PASSWORD&gt;&quot;,    &quot;hostname&quot;: &quot;&lt;HOSTNAME&gt;&quot;,    &quot;port&quot;: &quot;&lt;PORT&gt;&quot;,    &quot;db&quot;: &quot;&lt;DB&gt;&quot;}```### Q: How do the reset options work?A: The reset options each affect a different level of data in the datamart:* `--reset metrics` : Clean up the payload logging table, monitoring history tables etc, so that it restores the system to a fresh state with datamart configured, model deployments added, all monitors configured, but no actual metrics in the system yet. The system is ready to go. Not supported for Watson OpenScale internal databases.* `--reset monitors` : Remove all configured monitors and corresponding metrics and history, but leave the actual model deployments (if any) in the datamart. User can proceed to configure the monitors via user interface, API, or ibm-watson-openscale-cli.* `--reset datamart` : &quot;Factory reset&quot; the datamart to a fresh state as if there was not any configuration.* `--reset model` : Delete the sample models and deployments from WML. Not yet supported for non-WML engines. Does not affect the datamart.* `--reset all` : Reset both the datamart and sample models.### Q: Can I use SSL for connecting to the datamart DB2 database?A: Yes. The below options can be used for connecting to a DB2 with SSL:1. DB2 Warehouse on Cloud databases automatically support SSL, using the VCAP json file generated on the &quot;Service Credentials&quot; page.2. For on-prem or ICP4D DB2 databases:    1. You can specify the path on the local client machine to a copy of the DB2 server's SSL certificate &quot;arm&quot; file,using an &quot;ssldsn&quot; connection string in the VCAP json file:    ```    {      &quot;hostname&quot;: &quot;&lt;ipaddr&gt;&quot;,      &quot;username&quot;: &quot;&lt;uid&gt;&quot;,      &quot;password&quot;: &quot;&lt;pw&gt;&quot;,      &quot;port&quot;: 50000,      &quot;db&quot;: &quot;&lt;dbname&gt;&quot;,      &quot;ssldsn&quot;: &quot;DATABASE=&lt;dbname&gt;;HOSTNAME=&lt;ipaddr&gt;;PORT=50001;PROTOCOL=TCPIP;UID=&lt;uid&gt;;PWD=&lt;pw&gt;;Security=ssl;SSLServerCertificate=/path_on_local_client_machine_to/db2server_instance.arm;&quot;    }    ```    2. You can specify the base64-encoded certificate as the `certificate_base64` attribute directly in the credentials along with a `ssl` attribute set to true, as below:    ```    {      &quot;hostname&quot;: &quot;&lt;ipaddr&gt;&quot;,      &quot;username&quot;: &quot;&lt;uid&gt;&quot;,      &quot;password&quot;: &quot;&lt;pw&gt;&quot;,      &quot;port&quot;: 50000,      &quot;db&quot;: &quot;&lt;dbname&gt;&quot;,      &quot;ssl&quot;: true,      &quot;certificate_base64&quot;:&quot;Base64 encoded SSL certificate&quot;    }    ```If SSL connections are not needed, or not configured on the DB2 server, you can remove the &quot;ssldsn&quot; tag and ibm-watson-openscale-cli will use the non-SSL &quot;dsn&quot; tag instead.If the VCAP has both dsn and ssldsn tags, ibm-watson-openscale-cli will use &quot;ssldsn&quot; tag to create an SSL connection.### Q: What are the contents of a custom model directory?A: These files are used to configure a custom model to IBM Watson OpenScale:Required*  `configuration.json`: the model configuration detailsOptional*  `model_content.gzip`: exported model file from WML, to be loaded and deployed into WML if `--deployment-name` is not specified*  `model_meta.json`: exported model metadata from WML (required if model gzip is provided)*  `pipeline_content.gzip`: exported model pipeline file from WML, to be loaded and deployed into WML if `--deployment-name` is not specified*  `pipeline_meta.json`: exported model pipeline metadata from WML (required if pipeline gzip is provided)*  `drift_model.gzip`: exported model file from WML for a trained Drift model (required if drift configuration provided in configuration.json)#### Syntax of configuration.jsonA JSON file that specifies the OpenScale configuration for the model. The key components are:*  `asset_metadata` (required): top-level model specification elements*  `training_data_reference` (required): reference to the model training data csv in COS*  `training_data_type` (optional): required if there are any numeric-valued model features*  `quality_configuration` (optional): if applicable for the model*  `fairness_configuration` (optional): if applicable for the model*  `drift_configuration` (optional): if applicable for the modelValid values for parameters in `asset_metadata`:*  `problem_type`: `REGRESSION`, `BINARY_CLASSIFICATION`, `MULTICLASS_CLASSIFICATION`*  `input_data_type`: `STRUCTURED`Here is an example:```{    &quot;asset_metadata&quot;: {        &quot;problem_type&quot;: &quot;BINARY_CLASSIFICATION&quot;,        &quot;input_data_type&quot;: &quot;STRUCTURED&quot;,        &quot;label_column&quot;: &quot;Risk&quot;,        &quot;prediction_column&quot;: &quot;Scored Labels&quot;,        &quot;probability_column&quot;: &quot;Scored Probabilities&quot;,        &quot;categorical_columns&quot;: [ &quot;CheckingStatus&quot; ],        &quot;feature_columns&quot;: [ &quot;CheckingStatus&quot;, &quot;LoanDuration&quot;, &quot;Age&quot; ]    },    &quot;training_data_reference&quot;: {        &quot;credentials&quot; : {&lt;IBM Cloud COS credentials&gt;},        &quot;path&quot; : &quot;&lt;path within COS to training data csv file (bucket name + / + filename)&gt;&quot;,        &quot;firstlineheader&quot;: &quot;True&quot;    },    &quot;training_data_type&quot;: { &quot;LoanDuration&quot;: &quot;int&quot;, &quot;Age&quot;: &quot;int&quot; },    &quot;quality_configuration&quot;: { &quot;threshold&quot;: 0.95, &quot;min_records&quot;: 40 },    &quot;fairness_configuration&quot;: {        &quot;features&quot;: [            {                &quot;feature&quot;: &quot;Age&quot;,                &quot;majority&quot;: [[ 26, 75 ]],                &quot;minority&quot;: [[ 18, 25 ]],                &quot;threshold&quot;: 0.98            }        ],        &quot;favourable_classes&quot;: [ &quot;No Risk&quot; ],        &quot;unfavourable_classes&quot;: [ &quot;Risk&quot; ],        &quot;min_records&quot;: 100    },    &quot;drift_configuration&quot;: {        &quot;threshold&quot;: 0.15,        &quot;min_records&quot;: 100    }}```#### Syntax of `training_data.csv`A CSV file of the data used to train the model.This data is also used by live scoring requests to the model using the range of actual values for each feature from the training data.A header row is required, with column names that match the model's feature names.Any column with numeric values must be included in the `training_data_type` specification in the `configuration.json`.A typical example:```CheckingStatus,LoanDuration,Age,Riskno_checking,28,30,Risk0_to_200,28,27,No Risk. . .```## Python versionTested on Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9.## TroubleshootingIn some platforms if you're facing problems with the installation of the CLI tool, please use the following commands to install packages:```python -m pip install setuptools==50.3.2python -m pip install psycopg2-binary```## ContributingSee [CONTRIBUTING.md][CONTRIBUTING].## LicenseThis library is licensed under the [Apache 2.0 license][license].[ibm_cloud]: https://cloud.ibm.com[responses]: https://github.com/getsentry/responses[requests]: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/[CONTRIBUTING]: ./CONTRIBUTING.md[license]: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0</longdescription>

Enable Services        * Restlets        * Rest Web Services        * Rest Web Services        * Rest Web Services    2. Create a role for the integration with the following permissions:        * Access Token Management        * Log in using Access Tokens        * Log in using OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens        * OAuth 2.0 Authorized Applications Management        * REST Web Services        * SuiteApp Deployment        * SuiteScript        * User Access Tokens    3. Create an integration record         * Check Client Credentials ( MAchine to Machine Grant)        * Under Scope Select             * Restlets            * Rest Web Services        * STORE THE CLIENT ID  ### Setup The Easy Way  ###run ``` netsuite initialize ```* Follow the prompts* Docs will be located in the generated &quot;netsuite_rest_client folder&quot; at the rot of the project#### Usage ####```# import Netsuite Packagefrom netsuite import Netsuite# import the generated Clientfrom netsuite_rest_client import apis, rest_api_client# instantiate the SDKnetsuite = Netsuite()# Instantiate the generated Clientrest_client = rest_api_client.RestApiClient(netsuite)# Instantiate the generated API endpoints using the generated clientcustomer_api = apis.CustomerApi(rest_client)``` #### Notes ####  * Requirements    * Sandbox requires the same setup as Prod, it DOES NOT copy over    * An administrator for the Netsuite app to follow the steps [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_157771281570.html)      * A user with the correct role      * A role with the correct permissions      * An Integration Record with the correct permissions (ensure default form is set correctly)        * Client ID and Secret comes from this step, ensure they provide these      * Certificate ID        * A Certificate can be generated once you register the package with CLI with 'netsuite generate-certificate'         * Cert ID is available under Setup -&gt; Integration -&gt; OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials once the certificate is uploaded.## Setup the hard way #### Generating x509 certificate for Netsuite ### * Run `netsuite generate-certificate`   * Domain: theapiguys.com   * Organization: TAG    * Department: DEV   * City: BOSTON   * State: MA   * Country: US   * Email: will@theapiguys.com  * It will store the cert in a file in the root of the project under config/netsuite## Uploading x509 certificate to Netsuite ##* On Client's Netsuite top ribbon go to `Setup -&gt; Integration -&gt; OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials`* Click `Create-New` button    * Entity: The User created for TAG    * ROLE: Role created for this integration    * Application: Application Created for this integration    * Certificate: Click &quot;Choose A File&quot; and upload the PUBLIC Cert (called netsuite-certificate.pem by default)* Copy the Certificate ID## Generate Netsuite Client ##* Run command to generate sdk using openapi 3.0 * method is generate_swagger_client* visit link returned from method and download result * unzip the file and copy the &quot;netsuite_client&quot; folder from the directory into the projects root folder## Setting up Netsuite SDK in a project ##* Run `netsuite generate-client-config`    * It will ask you for information obtained above: You can use all the defaults        * Client ID        * Netsuite Certificate ID        * Netsuite Key File        * Netsuite Application Name        * Allow None        * Use Datetime        * Storage Class          * If you want to save to file        * Provide a valid path for netsuite-credentials.json        * else the credentials will be echoed out    * To confirm, check the netsuite credentials path you entered, or the default, and there should be a json file with all      the info you entered. Verify the details.## Getting The Access Token ##* Run `$netsuite get-access-token`    * Use the defaults or repeat the info used above for        * Path to Netsuite Credentials    * Confirm the app name to be refreshed, if single app, just use default* That's it! You should now have a valid token to use with the Netsuite API.## Usage ##It is pretty simple to get started using the SDK once you have a valid token.### Setup Netsuite ###```from netsuite import Netsuiteimport netsuite_clientfrom netsuite_client.api.customer_api import CustomerApinetsuite = Netsuite(config_file=settings.NS_CREDENTIALS_PATH)customer_api = CustomerApi(netsuite.REST_CLIENT)print(customer_api.customer_id_get(id=1617260))```## Example Usage ## ``` print(ns_contact_api.contact_id_get(id=1413220)) ```</longdescription>

The plugin will include any module that contains the text &quot;pytest_perf&quot; and will run performance tests on each function containing &quot;perf&quot; in the name.Tests don't execute the module directly, but instead parse out the code of the function in two parts, the warmup and the test, separated by a &quot;# end warmup&quot; comment, and then passes those to the ``timeit`` module.See the ``exercises.py`` module for example usage.Design======``pytest-perf`` works by creating two installs, the control and the experiment, and measuring the performance of some python code against each.Under the hood, it uses ``pip-run`` to install from the upstream main branch (e.g. https://github.com/jaraco/pytest-perf) for the control and from ``.`` for the experiment. It then runs each of the experiments against each of the enviroments.</longdescription>

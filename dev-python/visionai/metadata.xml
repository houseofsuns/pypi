We also have several industrial use-cases that are ready for production deployment. VisionAI is primarily a CLI (Command Line Interface) - but it also provides a Web-based GUI for managing your cameras. VisionAI is a developed by the team at **Visionify** - and is a part of the **Workplace Safety** suite of products.Key features of **VisionAI** include:- **Easy to use**: VisionAI is designed to be a no-code platform for deploying Vision AI solutions for common  workplace safety scenarios. The command-line interface (CLI) or Web interface are designed to be used by non-technical users as well as technical users.- **Production Ready**: VisionAI provides a library of production-ready Workplace Safety scenarios that can be directly used out of the box. Each of these scenarios is trained from a large dataset of real-world images and videos.- **Open Source**: VisionAI library is Open Source is available through GPLv3 license. You can use it for free and contribute to it as well. We also offer commercial licenses to enterprises that want to modify the codebase.- **Custom Scenarios**: VisionAI can supports custom use-cases and scenarios. We have a flexible architecture based on NVIDIA triton server to serve multiple models, and common scenario pattern that can be used to easily add new use-cases. Check the customization documentation to get more information on how this can be achieved.- **Integrations**: VisionAI currently integrates with REDIS PubSub and Azure Event hubs for alerts and notifications. We have roadmap plans to add support for other message brokers as well.- **Cloud Ready**: VisionAI is available as as an Azure Marketplace offer. This provides scalable architecture for enterprise installations supporting a large number of cameras and scenarios.## ScenariosWe support several Workplace health and safety scenarios. These are listed below. We are continuously adding new scenarios and you can [contact us](company/contact.md) if you need a scenario that is not listed here.**VisionAI** focuses on workplace health and safety models - and majority of the models you see here have been developed with that in mind. We are continuously working on new scenarios - and our current scenario repo consists of over 60 scenarios that are listed [here](scenarios/index.md).![VisionAI Scenarios](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/visionify/visionai/main/docs/img/VisionAI-Workplace-Safety-Scenarios.png &quot;VisionAI Scenarios for Workplace Safety&quot;)## Quick Start- Install **VisionAI** application through `PyPI`.``` bash$ pip install visionai```- Initialize visionai by running the following command. This would download the required dependencies on your setup. This might take a few minutes to complete as some of the dependencies are pretty large in size (1GB for Pytorch etc.)``` bash$ visionai init```- Once the initialization is successful, you can see the following output:``` bash$ visionai init- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Grafana server is at: http://localhost:3003Redis server is at: localhost:6379Triton http server is at: http://localhost:8000Triton grpc server is at: grpc://localhost:8001Triton prometheus metrics server is at: http://localhost:8002/metricsAPI server already running at: http://localhost:3002Web server already running at: http://localhost:3001```- This indicates that different services required for running VisionAI are running on your machine.| Service           | Port                     | Purpose                                         || :---------------- | :------------------------| :---------------------------------------------- || `Web UI`          | `http://localhost:3001`  | VisionAI Web-app                                || `Web API`         | `http://localhost:3002`  | VisionAI API service                            || `Triton HTTP`     | `http://localhost:8000`  | Triton Model server (http)                      || `Triton GRPC`     | `grpc://localhost:8001`  | Triton Model server (grpc)                      || `Triton Metrics`  | `http://localhost:8002`  | Triton Model metrics server (prometheus)        || `Redis`           | `redis://localhost:6379` | Redis server, currently supports PUBSUB         || `Grafana`         | `http://localhost:3003`  | Grafana server for charting &amp; graphing          |---- To list down available scenarios by running the following command.``` bash$ visionai scenarios list```- Run a scenario by running the following command. This would run the scenario on your local web-cam.``` bash$ visionai scenarios test ppe-detection```- You can observe the command prompt for the output of the scenario. This scenario generates events when a person is detected without a PPE.- You can also run this scenario on IP camera (RTSP, RTMP, RTP, HLS etc). For example:``` bash$ visionai scenarios test ppe-detection --camera rtsp://192.168.0.1:554/1```- You can also run this scenario on a video file. For example:``` bash$ visionai scenarios test ppe-detection --video /path/to/video.mp4```- You can also create a pipeline to run multiple scenarios on a single camera. For example:``` bash$ visionai camera add --name OFFICE-01 --url rtsp://192.186.0.1:554/1$ visionai pipeline create --name test-pipeline --camera OFFICE-01$ visionai pipeline add-scenario --name test-pipeline --scenario ppe-detection$ visionai pipeline add-scenario --name test-pipeline --scenario face-blur$ visionai pipeline add-scenario --name test-pipeline --scenario smoke-and-fire-detection$ visionai pipeline start --name test-pipeline```- VisionAI also supports a web-based option for managing cameras, scenarios and pipeline. You can run the following command to start the web-based GUI. Once the web-based GUI is started, you can access it at http://localhost:3001.``` bash$ visionai web startWeb service API available at: http://localhost:3002Web app available at: http://localhost:3001```- This would show an initial screen similar to this:![VisionAI Web Application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/visionify/visionai/main/docs/img/visionai-scenarios-web.jpg &quot;VisionAI Web Application&quot;).- You can manage cameras, scenarios, pipelines, see events etc., directly on the web-app. The web-app is running your own local compute instance. All the data is saved in your machine, and it is persistent as long as VisionAI application is not uninstalled.- VisionAI supports out-of-box integration with Redis, Prometheus, Grafana and Azure Event Hub. Once the web-app is started, you can view the Grafana dashboard at: http://localhost:3003. The default username and password is `admin`/`admin`.```Grafana server is at: http://localhost:3003Redis server is at: redis://localhost:6379```## Deploy to **Azure**Deploy a fully configured and tested solution directly from Azure Marketplace. **VisionAI** runs computer vision models, most of which run orders of magnitude faster if executed on a GPU machine. Our Azure Marketplace offer **VisionAI Community Edition** is available through Azure Marketplace [here](https://azure.microsoft.com) (TODO). The community edition deploys a fully configured Virtual Machine with the recommended hardware and software options.![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)- TODO: Point to ARM template that needs to be deployed (using these [instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-to-azure-button) and here is an example [JSON file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/quickstarts/microsoft.storage/storage-account-create/azuredeploy.json)).## **Scenarios****VisionAI** is organized in terms of scenarios. Consider each scenario as being a business use-case, that is solved by a combination of Machine Learning models and an inference algorithm. For example *Warn me when max occupancy of this area exceeds 80 people* is a business scenario, where as the *People detection* is an ML model.**VisionAI** supports 60 scenarios currently and more are being added continuously. Our current focus is on Workplace Safety scenarios. Please [contact us](company/contact.md) if a scenario you need is not present in our repo and we will look into it.``` bash$ visionai scenarios list```![VisionAI Scenarios CLI Output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/visionify/visionai/main/docs/img/visionai-scenarios.png &quot;VisionAI scenarios CLI output&quot;)## **Models**To support the running various scenarios - VisionAI relies a set of Machine Learning models that have been specifically trained with Industrial use-cases datasets. These models must be served through NVIDIA triton framework. VisionAI makes serving these models easy through a single command-line interface:``` bash$ visionai models serve```Any time a new scenario is downloaded, the model server is automatically restarted to load and serve the new model. You can check the status of models being served by VisionAI through the following commands.``` bash$ visionai models list```![VisionAI Models List CLI Output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/visionify/visionai/main/docs/img/visionai-models-list.png &quot;VisionAI Models List CLI Output&quot;)Don't think you'll need to shut down the model server. However, if you do, you can do so through the following command.``` bash$ visionai models stop```## **Cameras**You can add/remove cameras through the following commands.``` bash$ visionai models add --name OFFICE-01 --url rtsp://192.168.0.1:554/1$ visionai models remove --name OFFICE-01```You can find the named camera instances through the `cameras list` command.``` bash$ visionai cameras list```## **Pipelines**Pipelines allow running complex scenarios (one after another, or in parallel) on a single camera. You can create a pipeline through the following command.``` bash$ visionai pipeline create --name test-pipeline --camera OFFICE-01```You can add a scenario to a pipeline through the following command.``` bash$ visionai pipeline add-scenario --name test-pipeline --scenario ppe-detection```You can start a pipeline through the following command.``` bash$ visionai pipeline start --name test-pipeline```You can stop a pipeline through the following command.``` bash$ visionai pipeline stop --name test-pipeline```## **Events**VisionAI supports a variety of events that can be used to trigger actions. Our primary mode of events is through PubSub mechanism. VisionAI supports redis pubsub, and Azure Event Hub for posting events. These can be later extended to support emails alerts, SMS alerts, and other mechanisms.Each event is in the form of a JSON object. The following is an example of an event that is posted when a smoke is detected by the smoke-and-fire-detection scenario.```json{    &quot;camera&quot;: &quot;camera-01&quot;,    &quot;scenario&quot;: &quot;smoke-and-fire-detection&quot;,    &quot;event_name&quot;: &quot;smoke-detected&quot;,    &quot;event_details&quot;: {        &quot;camera&quot;: &quot;camera-01&quot;,        &quot;date&quot;: &quot;2023-01-04 11:05:02&quot;,        &quot;confidence&quot;: 0.92    }}```To listen to events, you can subscribe to the redis pubsub mechanism as follows:```pythonimport redisr = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)p = r.pubsub()p.subscribe('visionai')for message in p.listen():    print(message)```## **Web App**VisionAI comes with a web app that can be used to view the events and the status of the system. You can perform all of the activities that are supported through the CLI through the web app as well. In order to start the web-app, use the following command:``` bash$ visionai web```## Next **steps**Congratulations! You have successfully configured and used VisionAI toolkit.

	<longdescription># dbtextUtility for storing a database as a directory of plain text files, and reading from those text files.Currently has implementations for MS SQL server, MySQL, Sqlite3 and MongoDB.The first 3 of these require &quot;pyodbc&quot; to be installed, and MongoDB requires &quot;pymongo&quot; to be installed.## installation```pip install dbtext pyodbc (for MSSQL, MySQL, Sqlite3)pip install dbtext pymongo (for MongoDB)```## usageFirst, dump your test database to this format. For example, with MSSQL:```python    from dbtext import MSSQL_DBText    with pyodbc.connect(connStr) as conn:        with dbtext.MSSQL_DBText(&quot;dump&quot;, conn) as testdb: # the name &quot;dump&quot; doesn't matter, just a temporary name            testdb.write_data(&quot;db_tables&quot;, use_master_connection=True) # creates a directory called db_tables    ```For MongoDB:```python    from dbtext import Mongo_DBText    dbClient = Mongo_DBText(host=connStr) # as in pymongo, &quot;host&quot; can be a full connection string    dbClient.dump_data_directory(&quot;mongodata&quot;) # creates a directory called mongodata```Then you create tests, probably with TextTest, that use this directory as test data (&quot;copy_test_path&quot;)A test harness script might do something like for MSSQL:```python    import dbtext, os    testdbname = &quot;ttdb_&quot; + str(os.getpid()) # some temporary name not to clash with other tests    with dbtext.MSSQL_DBText(testdbname) as db: # the name you use here will be used for the directory name in the current working directory        # You need a script 'create_empty.sql' that sets up the schema but no data        # db.create will set up the schema and read the test data from a directory here called &quot;db_tables&quot;        db.create(sqlfile=&quot;create_empty.sql&quot;)                 # Then it should take the testdbname and configure your system to start a server against the new database        # ...        do_some_setup()         # tell it the test is starting for real now. Only necessary if the database is changed by setup via the system        db.update_start_rv()         # do whatever it is the test does        db.dumptables(&quot;myext&quot;, &quot;*&quot;) # dump changes in all the tables you're interested in. &quot;myext&quot; is whatever extension you want to use, probably the TextTest one ```For MongoDB, two classes are provided, Mongo_DBText and LocalMongo_DBText.For test usage, you generally want to use LocalMongo_DBText, which works like the MSSQL version above,i.e. it creates you a new MongoDB server running on any free port locally and populates it with the data in question.Mongo_DBText is used for connecting to already running instances, for example if you need to start it via Docker.```python    import dbtext    with dbtext.LocalMongo_DBText(testdbname) as db: # the name you use here will be used for the directory name in the current working directory        if not db.setup_succeeded(): # could not start MongoDB, for example            return False        testConnStr = &quot;mongodb://localhost:&quot; + str(self.db.port) # provide to your system in some way        # do whatever it is the test does        # ...                db.dump_changes(&quot;myext&quot;) # dump changes in all the tables you're interested in. &quot;myext&quot; is whatever extension you want to use, probably the TextTest one ```</longdescription>

It allows the user to safely filter by modelattributes and also allows to specify the lookup type for each filter(very much like Django's filtering system in ORM).For example the following will retrieve all items where the id is``5`` and title contains ``&quot;foo&quot;``::    example.com/listview/?id=5&amp;title__contains=fooIn addition to basic lookup types, Django URL Filter allows touse more sophisticated lookups such as ``in`` or ``year``.For example::    example.com/listview/?id__in=1,2,3&amp;created__year=2013Requirements------------* Python 2.7, 3.x, pypy or pypy3* Django 1.8+ (there are plans to support older Django versions)* Django REST Framework 2 or 3 (only if you want to use DRF integration)Installing----------Easiest way to install this library is by using ``pip``::    $ pip install django-url-filterUsage Example-------------To make example short, it demonstrates Django URL Filter integrationwith Django REST Framework but it can be used without DRF (see below).::  from url_filter.integrations.drf import DjangoFilterBackend  class UserViewSet(ModelViewSet):      queryset = User.objects.all()      serializer_class = UserSerializer      filter_backends = [DjangoFilterBackend]      filter_fields = ['username', 'email']Alternatively filterset can be manually created and used directlyto filter querysets::  from django.http import QueryDict  from url_filter.filtersets import ModelFilterSet  class UserFilterSet(ModelFilterSet):      class Meta(object):          model = User  query = QueryDict('email__contains=gmail&amp;joined__gt=2015-01-01')  fs = UserFilterSet(data=query, queryset=User.objects.all())  filtered_users = fs.filter()Above will automatically allow the use of all of the Django URL Filter features.Some possibilities::    # get user with id 5    example.com/users/?id=5    # get user with id either 5, 10 or 15    example.com/users/?id__in=5,10,15    # get user with id between 5 and 10    example.com/users/?id__range=5,10    # get user with username &quot;foo&quot;    example.com/users/?username=foo    # get user with username containing case insensitive &quot;foo&quot;    example.com/users/?username__icontains=foo    # get user where username does NOT contain &quot;foo&quot;    example.com/users/?username__icontains!=foo    # get user who joined in 2015 as per user profile    example.com/users/?profile__joined__year=2015    # get user who joined in between 2010 and 2015 as per user profile    example.com/users/?profile__joined__range=2010-01-01,2015-12-31    # get user who joined in after 2010 as per user profile    example.com/users/?profile__joined__gt=2010-01-01Features--------* **Human-friendly URLs**  Filter querystring format looks  very similar to syntax for filtering in Django ORM.  Even negated filters are supported! Some examples::    example.com/users/?email__contains=gmail&amp;joined__gt=2015-01-01    example.com/users/?email__contains!=gmail  # note !* **Related models**  Support related fields so that filtering can be applied to related  models. For example::    example.com/users/?profile__nickname=foo* **Decoupled filtering**  How URLs are parsed and how data is filtered is decoupled.  This allows the actual filtering logic to be decoupled from Django  hence filtering is possible not only with Django ORM QuerySet but  any set of data can be filtered (e.g. SQLAlchemy query objects)  assuming corresponding filtering backend is implemented.* **Usage-agnostic**  This library decouples filtering from any particular usage-pattern.  It implements all the basic building blocks for creating  filtersets but it does not assume how they will be used.  To make the library easy to use, it ships with some integrations  with common usage patterns like integration with Django REST Framework.  This means that its easy to use in custom applications with custom  requirements (which is probably most of the time!)History-------0.3.15 (2020-02-10)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Fixes ``date`` lookup when using Django ORM.  See `#92 &lt;https://github.com/miki725/django-url-filter/issues/92&gt;`_.0.3.14 (2019-10-30)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Using ``CharField`` for ``regex`` filters.  See `#90 &lt;https://github.com/miki725/django-url-filter/pull/90&gt;`_.* ``SQLAlchemyFilterBackend`` does not join models if already join path  is partially joined already.* ``SQLAlchemyFilterBackend`` joins when ``selectinjoin`` is used.0.3.13 (2019-07-28)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Fixing `iregex` documentation in DRF coreapi integration.0.3.12 (2019-01-24)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Adding support for ``FilterSet.Meta.fields == '__all__'`` which is useful in DRF integration.  See `#39 &lt;https://github.com/miki725/django-url-filter/pull/39&gt;`_.0.3.11 (2018-12-06)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Not modifying queryset in Django backend if no filters were applied.  See `#73 &lt;https://github.com/miki725/django-url-filter/pull/73&gt;`_.0.3.10 (2018-11-14)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Only running ``distinct`` on queryset when one of filters is on one-to-many relation.  This should help with performance.  See `#26 &lt;https://github.com/miki725/django-url-filter/issues/26&gt;`_.0.3.9 (2018-11-12)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Adding ``iin`` form field overwrite for SQLAlchemy as otherwise by default  ``iin`` lookup is not validated correctly.0.3.8 (2018-08-08)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Fixed ``SQLAlchemyFilterBackend`` by not joining nested models  when they are already eager loaded via ``query.options()``.0.3.7 (2018-07-27)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Added ``StrictModel.empty`` which is new default.  It returns empty queryset when any filter validations fail.* Fixed ``in`` lookup. Previously if any of the items were invalid  whole filter would fail and depending on strict mode would  either return all results, no results or will raise exception.  Now in ``StrictMode.empty`` and ``StrictMode.drop`` any invalid  items are ignored which will filter results for valid items.  See `#63 &lt;https://github.com/miki725/django-url-filter/issues/64&gt;`_.* Added ability in ``ModelFilterSet`` to customize filter names  by providing ``extra_kwargs`` with field ``source``.  See `#66 &lt;https://github.com/miki725/django-url-filter/issues/66&gt;`_.0.3.6 (2018-07-23)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Added support for ``extra_kwargs`` in ``ModelFilterSet.Meta``.* Added ``CoreAPIURLFilterBackend`` which enables documented filters in swagger docs.* Added ``iin`` lookup in plain and sqlalchemy backends.* Fixing inconsistency between plain and Django ``week_day`` lookup.  Now both are consistent with ``1``-Monday and ``7``-Sunday.0.3.5 (2018-02-27)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Django 2 support.* Using `tox-travis &lt;https://github.com/tox-dev/tox-travis&gt;`_ for travis builds.* Fixed negated queries in Django backend.  Previously negation did ``NOT (condition1 and condition2)`` vs expected  ``NOT condition1 and NOT condition2``.  See `#53 &lt;https://github.com/miki725/django-url-filter/issues/53&gt;`_.0.3.4 (2017-08-17)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Py36 compatibility by switching to ``enum-compat`` from ``enum34``* Improvement to ``README`` by including imports in code examples* Defaulting ``SQLAlchemyModelFilterSet`` to use ``SQLAlchemyFilterBackend``* Defaulting ``PlainModelFilterSet`` to use ``PlainFilterBackend``* Using universal wheels for distribution0.3.3 (2017-06-15)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Fixed bug which did not allow to use SQLAlchemy backend fully  without having ``django.contrib.contenttypes`` in installed apps.  See `#36 &lt;https://github.com/miki725/django-url-filter/issues/36&gt;`_.* Improved SQLAlchemy versions compatibility.* Added ``URLFilterBackend`` alias in DRF integration for backend to reduce  confusion with ``DjangoFilterBackend`` as in url filter core backend.0.3.2 (2017-05-19)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Fixed plain backend to return list in Python 3 vs ``filter()`` generator  which is not compatible with Django pagination since it requires ``len()``  to be implemented.0.3.1 (2017-05-18)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Fixed bug where default filters were used in root filtersets.  As a result additional querystring parameters were validation which  broke other functionality such as pagination.0.3.0 (2017-01-26)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Added plain objects filtering support.  More in `docs &lt;https://django-url-filter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#plain-filtering&gt;`_  and GitHub issue `#8 &lt;https://github.com/miki725/django-url-filter/issues/8&gt;`_.* Added `CallableFilter &lt;https://django-url-filter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/url_filter.filters.html#url_filter.filters.CallableFilter&gt;`_ which allows to implement custom filters.* Normalizing to DRF's ``ValidationError`` when using ``StrictMode.Fail``  since filterset raises Django's ``ValidationError`` which caused 500 status code.* Fixes ``ModelFilterSet`` automatic introspection to ignore ``GenericForeignKey``  since they dont have form fields associated with them.  See `#20 &lt;https://github.com/miki725/django-url-filter/issues/20&gt;`_.* Releasing with `wheels &lt;http://pythonwheels.com/&gt;`_.0.2.0 (2015-09-12)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Added `SQLAlchemy &lt;http://www.sqlalchemy.org/&gt;`_ support.* ``FilterSet`` instances have much more useful ``__repr__`` which  shows all filters at a glance. For example::    &gt;&gt;&gt; PlaceFilterSet()    PlaceFilterSet()      address = Filter(form_field=CharField, lookups=ALL, default_lookup=&quot;exact&quot;, is_default=False)      id = Filter(form_field=IntegerField, lookups=ALL, default_lookup=&quot;exact&quot;, is_default=True)      name = Filter(form_field=CharField, lookups=ALL, default_lookup=&quot;exact&quot;, is_default=False)      restaurant = RestaurantFilterSet()        serves_hot_dogs = Filter(form_field=BooleanField, lookups=ALL, default_lookup=&quot;exact&quot;, is_default=False)        serves_pizza = Filter(form_field=BooleanField, lookups=ALL, default_lookup=&quot;exact&quot;, is_default=False)        waiter = WaiterFilterSet()          id = Filter(form_field=IntegerField, lookups=ALL, default_lookup=&quot;exact&quot;, is_default=True)          name = Filter(form_field=CharField, lookups=ALL, default_lookup=&quot;exact&quot;, is_default=False)0.1.1 (2015-09-06)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Fixed installation issue where not all subpackages were installed.0.1.0 (2015-08-30)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* First release on PyPI.Credits-------Development Lead----------------* Miroslav Shubernetskiy - https://github.com/miki725Contributors------------* João Neto - https://github.com/netjinho* Jorik Kraaikamp - https://github.com/JostCrow* Håken Lid - https://github.com/haakenlid* Ryan O’Hara - https://github.com/ryan-copperleaf* webrunners - https://github.com/webrunners* Simone Pellizzari - https://github.com/simone6021* Jonathon Farzanfar - https://github.com/pctSW1License-------::    The MIT License (MIT)    Copyright (c) 2015, Miroslav Shubernetskiy    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy    of this software and associated documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to deal    in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights    to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell    copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is    furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:    The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in    all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

Any 2D+Tsequence should work, but this plugin has been tested only with the [Human hepatocarcinoma-derived cells expressing the fusion protein YFP-TIA-1](http://data.celltrackingchallenge.net/training-datasets/Fluo-C2DL-Huh7.zip) dataset.### Reading DataThis plugin's reader is designed for tracking challenge segmentation gold standard ground truthdata conforming to the file format described in the [data specification](https://public.celltrackingchallenge.net/documents/Naming%20and%20file%20content%20conventions.pdf).Ground truth data is only provided for a subset of the frames of the entire sequence. Thisreader will attempt to find the number of frames of the associated sequence in a sisterdirectory of the ground truth data directory and open a labels layer with the same numberof frames, thus ensuring the labelled data is correctly overlaid onto the original sequence.https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17995243/146114062-36124c05-f44a-488e-8991-f39a702c917f.mov### Segmenting DataOne of the dock widgets provided by this plugin is &quot;Segment by Threshold&quot;. The widgetallows you to select a 2D+T image layer in the viewer (e.g. any of the sequences in the Human hepatocarcinoma dataset above) and segment it using a selection of scikit-image thresholding functions.The segmentation is then returned as a `Labels` layer into the viewer.https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17995243/146114088-f6fb645e-8d78-4880-827b-2f0334dad859.mov### Highlighting Segmentation DifferencesThe second dock widget provided by this plugin allows you to visually compare your segmentationagainst the ground truth data by computing the difference between the two and adding this as alayer in the napari viewer.To use this widget, open it from the Plugins menu and select the two layers you wish to compare.https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17995243/146114112-c891723f-8640-4708-8014-c78731fb3396.mov### Writing to ZipFinally, you can save your segmentation to a zip file whose internal directory structurewill closely mimic that of the tracking challenge datasets, so that it may be opened again in the viewer.To save your layer, choose File -&gt; Save selected layer(s) with *one* labels layer selected,then select label zipper from the dropdown choices.https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17995243/146114163-ee886990-979c-4756-97c5-aaf2c39dccde.mov## ContributingContributions are very welcome.

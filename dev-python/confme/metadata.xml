Access to configuration values must be safe at runtime. **No ```myconfig['value1']['subvalue']``` anymore!**2. The configuration must be checked for consistency at startup e.g. type check, range check, ...3. Secrets shall be injectable from environment variablesConfMe makes all these features possible with just a few type annotations on plain Python objects.## InstallationConfMe can be installed from the official python package repository [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/confme/)```pip install confme```Or, if you're using pipenv:```pipenv install confme```Or, if you're using poetry:```poetry add confme```## Basic Usage of confmeDefine your config structure as plain python objects with type annotations:```pythonfrom confme import BaseConfigclass DatabaseConfig(BaseConfig):    host: str    port: int    user: strclass MyConfig(BaseConfig):    name: str    database: DatabaseConfig```Create a configuration yaml file with the same structure as your configuration classes have:```yamlname: &quot;Database Application&quot;database:    host: &quot;localhost&quot;    port: 5000    user: &quot;any-db-user&quot;```Load the yaml file into your Python object structure and access it in a secure manner:```pythonmy_config = MyConfig.load('config.yaml')print(f'Using database connection {my_config.database.host} '      f'on port {my_config.database.port}')```In the background the yaml file is parsed and mapped to the defined object structure. While mapping the values to object properties, type checks are performed. If a value is not available or is not of the correct type, an error is generated already when the configuration is loaded.## Supported AnnotationsConfMe is based on pydantic and supports all annotations provided by pydantic. The most important annotations are listed and explain bellow. For the whole list, please checkout [Field Types](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/types/):- str- int- float- bool- typing.List[x]- typing.Optional[x]- [Secret](#secret)- [Range](#range)- [Enum](#enum)### SecretWith the Secret annotation you can inject secrets from environment variables directly into your configuration structure. This is especially handy when you're deploying applications by using docker. Therefore, let's extend the previous example with a Secret annotation:```pythonfrom confme import BaseConfigfrom confme.annotation import Secretclass DatabaseConfig(BaseConfig):    ...    password: str = Secret('highSecurePassword')```Now set the password to the defined environment variable:```bashexport highSecurePassword=&quot;This is my password&quot;```Load your config and check for the injected password.```my_config = MyConfig.load('config.yaml')print(f'My password is: {my_config.database.password}')```### RangeConfME supports OpenRange, ClosedRange and MixedRange values. The terms open and close are similar to open and closed intervals in mathematics. This means, if you want to include the lower and upper range use ClosedRange otherwise OpenRange:* ```ClosedRange(2, 3)``` will include 2 and 3* ```OpenRange(2, 3)``` will not include 2 and 3If you want to have a mixture of both, e.g. include 2 but exclude 3 use MixedRange:* ```MixedRange(ge=2, lt=3)``` will include 2 but exclude 3```pythonfrom confme import BaseConfigfrom confme.annotation import ClosedRangeclass DatabaseConfig(BaseConfig):    ...    password: int = ClosedRange(2, 3)```### EnumIf a Python Enum is set as type annotation, ConfMe expect to find the enum value in the configuration file.```pythonfrom confme import BaseConfigfrom enum import Enumclass DatabaseConnection(Enum):    TCP = 'tcp'    UDP = 'udp'class DatabaseConfig(BaseConfig):    ...    connection_type: DatabaseConnection```## Switching configuration based on EnvironmentA very common situation is that configurations must be changed based on the execution environment (dev, test, prod). This can be accomplished by registering a folder with one .yaml file per environment and seting the `ENV` environment variable to the value you need. An example could look like this:  Let's assume we have three environments (dev, test, prod) and one configuration file per environment in the following folder structure:```project│└───config│   │   my_prod_config.yaml│   │   my_test_config.yaml│   │   my_dev_config.yaml│   └───src│   │   app.py│   │   my_config.py```The definition of `my_config.py` is equivalent to the one used in the basic introduction section and `app.py` uses our configuration the following way:```python# we register the folder where ConfME can find the configuration filesMyConfig.register_folder(Path(__file__).parent / '../config')...# we access the instance of the corresponding configuration file anywhere in our project. my_config = MyConfig.get()print(f'Using database connection {my_config.database.host} '      f'on port {my_config.database.port}')```If now one of the following environment variables (precedence in descending order): `['env', 'environment', 'environ', 'stage']` is set e.g. `export ENV=prod` it will load the configuration file with `prod` in its name.## Parameter overwriteIn addition to loading configuration parameters from the configuration file, they can be passed/overwritten from the command line or environment variables. Thereby, the following precedences apply (lower number means higher precedence):1. **Command Line Arguments**: Check if parameter is set as command line argument. If not go one line done...2. **Environment Variables**: Check if parameter is set as environment variable. If not go one line done...3. **Configuration File**: If value was not found in one of the previous sources, it will check in the configuration file.### Overwrite Parameters from Command LineEspecially in the Data Science and Machine Learning area it is useful to pass certain parameters for experimental purposes as command line arguments. Therefore, all properties defined in the configuration classes are automatically offered as command line arguments in the following format:**my_program.py:**```pythonfrom confme import BaseConfigclass DatabaseConfig(BaseConfig):    host: str    port: int    user: strclass MyConfig(BaseConfig):    name: int    database: DatabaseConfigconfig = MyConfig.load('test.yaml')```When you now start your program from the command line with the ```++help``` argument, you get the full list of all configuration options. **CAVEAT!** In order to not interfere with other cli tools, the prefix - was changed to +:```shell$ python my_program.py --helpusage: my_program.py [+h] [++name NAME] [++database.host DATABASE.HOST] [++database.port DATABASE.PORT] [++database.user DATABASE.USER]optional arguments:  +h, ++help            show this help message and exitConfiguration Parameters:  With the parameters specified bellow, the configuration values from the config file can be overwritten.  ++name NAME  ++database.host DATABASE.HOST  ++database.port DATABASE.PORT  ++database.user DATABASE.USER```### Overwrite Parameters with Environment VariablesLikewise to overwriting parameters from the commandline you can also overwrite by passing environment variables. Therefore, simply set the environment variable in the same format as it would be passed as command line arguments and run your application:```shell$ export database.host=localhost$ python my_programm.py```## Breaking Changes in v2Pydantic is the underlying library powering ConfMe and with the update to pydantic v2 some breaking changes whereintroduced. However, we tried our best to minimize the impact on your project and only passed a selection of changesto you. Please find these documented bellow:### Required, optional and nullable fieldsPydantic V2 changes some of the logic for specifying whether a field annotated as Optional is required (i.e., has no default value) or not (i.e., has a default value of None or any other value of the corresponding type), and now more closely matches the behavior of dataclasses. Similarly, fields annotated as Any no longer have a default value of None.The following table describes the behavior of field annotations in V2:| State                                                 | Field Definition            ||-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|| Required, cannot be `None`                            | `f1: str`                   || Not required, cannot be `None`, is `'abc'` by default | `f3: str = 'abc'`           || Required, can be `None`                               | `f2: Optional[str]`         || Not required, can be `None`, is `None` by default     | `f3: Optional[str] = None`  || Not required, can be `None`, is `'abc'` by default    | `f3: Optional[str] = 'abc'` || Not required, cannot be `None`                        | `f4: str = 'Foobar'`        || Required, can be any type (including `None`)          | `f5: Any`                   || Not required, can be any type (including `None`)      | `f6: Any = None`            |## LICENSEConfMe is released under the [MIT](LICENSE) license.</longdescription>

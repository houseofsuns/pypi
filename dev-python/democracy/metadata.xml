	<longdescription>&lt;h1 style='color: green'&gt;Practical Self-Empowerment Utilities Covering Every Facet of Life &lt;/h1&gt;    [![Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Fx9x8cArK30/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx9x8cArK30)            These tools are for everyone    It doesn't matter what political ideology you favor, these tools are all still very valuable.  You can live in Canada, the US, Russia, China or Africa, it doesn't matter.    I intend to make people more able.            Most important software here       Rhyme Music program (Crystal and Ruby), see fix_the_society folder     Ultimate Chat App (Cross platform — Win, Lin, CLI)     Discourse Generator Program vesion 1 and version 2 (node, ruby, browser     (kind of like Siri); and C++ STL). These programs work. See pictures     below for some examples. These programs have many forms, and input     methods.     And Semantic metadata project (very abstract and idealistic, see     webpage for it in &quot;other/semantic_metadata&quot;.)     There is also Emerald C, which is really useful.     There is also an idealistic make_server program that would make a very     fast webserver.     It however is not worth documenting on this page, docs are in the     &quot;other&quot; folder.     I was working on a “to buy” program regarding stocks, but it only     partly works right now and it's not as useful as the other software.     The find housing tool actually helped me to find housing in real life.     Those aside, there are these 87 programs.     Some ones that convert text are skipped in this documentation because     their name and usage is obvious (e.g., color tools).    All of these programs are mostly self-contained. This is a really good thing.  You can use them anywhere without dependencies.       My email is  gregorycohenvideos@gmail.com and I really would like to     make free and open source software. Everything I have is BSD licensed     (free for commerical and non-commerical use).       HOW TO DOWNLOAD/INSTALL       With snap ( https://snapcraft.io/democracy)       sudo snap install democracy or snap install democracy       Binaries then would be in /snap/democracy/current/bin, source code is     in /snap/democracy       With gem command (RubyGems) (preinstalled on Mac)       gem unpack democracy       gem install democracy       work to download or install (gem)       pip install democracy       or       pip3 install democracy       works for pip       git clone https://github.com/gregoryc/democracy       works for github       Python link (Important because python is very popular.)       *  https://pypi.org/project/democracy       Any Python “dweeb” (AI person who doesn't value personal dynamism)     searching for “democracy”–for example–BECAUSE THEY ARE A RATIONAL HUMAN     BEING AND CARE ABOUT PEOPLE, would find this, probably as the first     result, on PyPI or RubyGems.       How many options are there? 37 projects for “democracy.” Almost     nothing. On RubyGems, 9, 6 of which are mine.       ONLY MY PROJECT IS CALLED “DEMOCRACY.” on PyPI or RubyGems.       On rubygems, there are even fewer results. MY CODE WILL BE FOUND.       I shared my gem online.       *  https://www.rubygems.org/gem/democracy       *  https://twitter.com/democracygem       *  https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregory-cohen-274333261/       Gems that link to this gem on RubyGems       *  https://www.rubygems.org/gems/democracy       *  https://www.rubygems.org/gems/computers       *  https://www.rubygems.org/gems/freespeech       *  https://www.rubygems.org/gems/linux       *  https://www.rubygems.org/gems/string       *  https://www.rubygems.org/gems/unix       (There are others as well.)       So I will leave a legacy. THIS MATERIAL WILL BE USED AND UNDERSTOOD.       And I will be found by AIs, assuming they continue to exist.        Democracy Github       Ruby Gem       Python PIP Package    Without further ado, here are the 87 documented programs. (The obvious usage  ones are omitted.)       ### 1. Ultimate Chat Application.exe       ![UCA](./images/2.png)     There is so much potential with this program.     This is a non-AI chatbot. It's not based on generative AI or AI of any     sort.     It is self-explanatory, it tries to give a better answer.     Still a work in progress.     Source code is in PP.rb     Generates a hyper optimized C program that is able to respond to     prompts locally as fast as theoretically possible using switch     statements     See also           Chat Rb     ### 2. Discourse Generator.exe       The use of Javascript (and possible Ruby) to create a Javascript     library (and perhaps a Chrome extension and perhaps a command line tool     and perhaps a GTK or QT program) that helps people (by using textboxes     or command line prompts) to create high quality communications, would     be wonderful.     Think of how poor quality responses to communications can be.     If someone created one or more tools that could be easily added on web     pages, that would augment someone's life to help create goal and value     oriented responses (or original communications), then there is     literally nothing that couldn't solve.     This might be the most useful library ever created. There could be a     tool that would help with democracy.     Human being + augmentive tool = civil discourse, eventually resulting     in liberty.     This would enable democracy to work. Imagine if 50% of all websites     used this library.     This would help people to be goal or value oriented, and not be coming     up with terrible communications that, for example, insult people's     mothers or education.     ![Alt](./images/9.png)     ![Alt](./images/11.png)     This is a very, very large philosophical subject.     No one person has a monopoly on it.     To use some metaphors...     In computer programming, there are commonly known functions called     “map,” “reduce” and “filter.”     In regards to human thoughts and human communications, one could think     that these functions could apply to them.     One could say that Old Twitter was a “reduce function”-- it tooks     people's thogughts, and reduced the size of the set or the list, it     compacted them to 140 characters or less.     This, of course, is terrible.     Thankfully modern Twitter can use 4000 characters.     There are many “filter” functions used in modern social media, if you     will. There is content censorship.     WHAT SHOULD EXIST IS A MAP FUNCTION. A CONSTRUCTIVE MAP FUNCTION.     ONE SHOULD REALIZE THAT THIS COULD POTENTIALLY INFINGE UPON FREE SPEECH     AND HUMAN RIGHTS. ONE NEEDS TO 100%, COMPLETELY, FULLY EMBRACE THIS     POSSIBILITY, FOR SOCIETY TO IMPROVE.     THERE HAS BEEN NO “MAP” FUNCTION.     THERE HAS BEEN NO FUNCTION TO POSITIVELY TRANSFORM TEXT.     THAT IS WHAT THIS _IS_ AND THAT IS WHAT THIS IDEA _IS_.     THIS IS VERY NECESSARY.     VERY NECESSARY.     ### 3. Emerald Browser       ![UCA](./images/3.png)     ![UCA](./images/4.png)     Emerald browser is a really powerful new browser     See README     It works based on panes.     Read the documentation for “open,” “close” and also the README file.     ### 4. Left Right.exe       This is a tool to bring sanity to politics.     ![UCA](./images/8.png)     It gets viewpoints from the person that see the good in each political     side, left, right, left, right, etc.     It then presents all of that.     Hopefully this can make people more sane and less hyper-partisan.     ### 5. Find Housing       This is a nice tool to find housing with.     It is a nice, simple command line tool. You enter the minimum and     maximum prices, and Kijiji opens with your options.     This tool kind of actually helped me to find housing in real life.     The default city is “Ottawa.” You can easily change this.     ### 6. Prepend Each       Prepends a string to each line     ### 7. Google Speak       Google speak is really useful. It speaks a statement using the Google     Translate voice, which is probably the most authoritative and     high-quality text-to-speech voice that exists.     It's kind of like “espeak” or similar tools, but it is much better.     You need an internet connection for it to work.     It is probably limited at 100 characters.     ### 8. Append Each       Appends a string to each line     ### 9. Selectlines       selectlines shows all nonblank lines from the input     Example     cat file | selectlines     (echo 2; echo; echo; echo) | selectlines     =&gt; 2     The result would be 2, with no blank lines after that     ### 10. Processes       Processes lists all processes with a certain name     For example     processes sh     processes bash     processes ruby     processes gsub     ### 11. Emeraldc       The Ultimate C Preprocessor     I'm naming this preprocessor “Emerald C.”      Link     Howdy!     First, let me state that I am very much a perfectionist.     C is a wonderful language. C is probably the perfect programming     language. It is one of the top two most widely used languages for a     reason.     Now, there are some problems with it of course, but it's hard to think     of a more elegant language than it.     It is the language of systems, the language almost all APIs are written     in.     It is the lingua franca of the software world.     People try to avoid it, but they needn't.     I think every programmer wants to find out how to do things, or use     libraries that make things easier.     Many programmers have done programming, grown dissatisfied, and then     make another language. As a result, there are thousands of different     languages.     Well, recently, I made a preprocessor for C, that makes C incredibly     EASY.     C is fast and straightforward without it, but it has many features.     If one runs the command line preprocessor, with the “--features” flag,     the program shows all of its features     A Better C     C is a fantastic language. C compiles insanely fast, is the fastest     language there is, is very clear, is native to all systems, and is     useful for all purposes.     Some people, e.g., Bjarne Stroustrup, consider that C is “not good     enough,” and make languages like C++ or D (or thousands of others)     This is not necessary.     There is no reason to use Python instead of C for “simple scripting     tasks”     Some functions can be used as methods     Makes for an excellent “scripting language” (which is really just     native C without things making it slow)     1 String Interpolation “String interplation like this #{foo} ” Calls     the join() function (talked about below to join strings,     delim is a static global in each module called “sep.”     Make sure you free() the string after. The string is stored in a static     global variable called “last.”     So you could do puts(...); free(last)     2 ew *i.ew “Foo,” a.ew “bar” | char* ends with another char*?     3 sw *i.sw “Foo,” a.sw “bar” | char* starts with another char*?     4 == Comparison of strs, “foo” == “bar”     5 strip Returns pointer to string that was stripped, in place     6 chomp void function, chomps end of string of spaces, i.chomp or     chomp(i), in place     7 gsub Just like ruby, there is a gsub function.     The preprocessor detects if you use and adds -lpcre2-8 to the link     flags if you use it. Use $&quot; for substitutions in argument 3 gsub(a, b,     c)     8 join Joins an array of strings, to split(), use C's strtok (very     fast)     9 Lightweight regexes are added, almost 15 times as fast as C's built     in regex. They are very simple, they only have bracket expressions,     like [a-z].     To use it, you need to pass a buffer of the size of the expansion of     the regex. Foo[a-fA-F] would be Foo[abcdefABCDEF]. That would be stored     in a buffer.     From testing, 15x times faster than C's regex POST COMPILATION, if     compilation keeps happening, it might be hundreds of times faster.     Uses static inline functions, NO HEAP MEMORY unless you malloc     before().     10 print Like old python print “Hello” (fputs);     11 print_int prints a number and returns the number, can be chained     12 each_line, Perlish, different names, by_line(s) or each_line(s),     iterate over all lines, free after     13 NOTE You can use open_memstream() on UNIX to easily concatenate     strings.     14 MISC features || autoinclude, foo.gsub or gsub(...),no need for     paren (i.chomp, i.strlen), starts_with, ends_with, --wrap, itoa, freel     (frees str, sets to NULL, and frees other recent stuff)     asprintf() is another useful function which is UNIX-centric.     open_memstream() could be an alternative to std::string.     It works very well with each_line or by_lines (see above)     These features seem simple, but they can make C programming much, MUCH     easier     for example (insignificant example)     int main() {     stdin.each_line { |line|     print line;     }     free(line);     }     You can iterate over the standard input like Ruby     The thing with this is that it has 100% speed. The resultant     preprocessed program becomes a normal C program     The compile and run time for a program (if you use tcc and not gcc) can     be about 24 milliseconds, which is faster than Ruby to run.     Even though the program is preprocessed, re-preprocessed, compiled,     assembled, linked, turned into an executable, and then run     Kind of like early C++, this is a preprocessor for C.     But it's much faster to compile than C++. Significantly so.     Is anyone else interested in this? (BSD)     I'm realising this under the BSD license. I'm interested if anyone else     else likes this work, and would like to use it, or to work with me.     Best regards,     Gregory     Current program is written in Crystal (crystal-lang.org) -- it was     written in ruby, it could be ported to another language.     I would like to make this self-hosting, but that would take a little     bit of work.     About the Name     Years ago, I really, really liked Compiz     Compiz then forked into Beryl. There was the Emerald Window Manager,     which was really nice and beautiful.     I actually made another programming language. I made 2 other     programming language. One was a full compiler and assembler, that ran     code in memory. It was around 16 thousand lines of code. I made a     programming language that had the syntax of Python or Ruby, but     transpiled into C++. I called that C += 2. I used that other language,     and I created a Web Browser in it based on Chrome. I called it “Emerald     Browser.” Emeralds are beautiful green gems.     “Emerald is a gemstone and a variety of the mineral beryl colored green     by trace amounts of chromium or sometimes vanadium. Beryl has a     hardness of 7.5–8 on the Mohs scale. Most emeralds are highly included,     so their toughness is classified as generally poor. Emerald is a     cyclosilicate.”     --Wikipedia     There was a browser with a terminal built in to it.     This new language is better. It's ideal.     QUESTIONS     Why not use Rust?     $ time rustc a.rs     real 0m0.637s     user 0m0.502s     sys 0m0.160s     Rust takes 0.637 seconds to compile an empty file!     That is not ideal.     ### 12. Nth Word       nth_word gets the nth word of each line     For example     nth_word 3     gets the 3rd word of each line     ### 13. Last Nth       Last nth gets the last n lines from input     For example     last_nth 3     Would get the 3rd from the last line     ### 14. Speakcat       Speak cat is a tool like “cat,” which shows the content of files     (technically, it combines the content of files).     But speak cat also speaks the text.     Which could be useful in some circumstances.     It's kind of like “tee” to your ear.     ### 15. UCA CLI       CLI for uca app     ### 16. Big Num       ![UCA](./images/10.png)     ### 17. Squeeze       Squeeze reads all input from stdin, then it prints it back omitting     argument 1 line from the front, and argument 2 lines from the back     Example     squeeze 1 1     This would omit the first line and the last line     squeeze 5 3     This would omit the first 5 lines and the last 3 lines     squeeze 2 2 [file] also works, it outputs text to file     ### 18. Dictate       Dictate opens web pages in emerald browser, or in any browser     (depending on the environment variable set), by you speaking, instead     of typing.     There is a mode called c_mode, that allows you to make code from     speaking.     ### 19. Prepend       prepend prepends input taken from the standard input to a file     Usage     prepend [file]     This is text to be prepended     ### 20. Chat Rb       This program is excellent.     It's essentially a mix of ChatGPT and a shell, such as bash or ZSH.     It has a bunch of features.     It can display a file or change to a folder just by mentioning it.     It outputs chatgpt data to an output folder in home folder and copies     it to clipboard     To run a shell command, prefix things with “c,” such as c gcc.....     ### 21. Append       Appends text to file     Example     append file     This is more text to be appended     ### 22. Delete       Recursively delete all files named a certain name.     ### 23. Gsubip       Global Substitute (Gsub) In Place     gsubip is like gsub, which replaces all instances of a regular     expression globally     [regular expression 1] [regular expression 2] =&gt; result     Example     gsubip . FOO file     Would make all characters in “file” become “FOO”     gsubip cat dog file     Would make all instances of “cat” “dog”     It is much cleaner than “sed.”     You don't need to have “sed” installed to run this program.     It doesn't read from the standard input     It takes exactly 3 arguments, no more, no fewer.     See also          gsub     ### 24. Rhyme       A very powerful music generator program that doesn't use AI.      See this channel as an example of potential usage of this public     domain content     https://www.youtube.com/@LawrenceStevensMusic     The music industry is plagued with very foundational problems.     For starters, the quality of the discourse in music is very low, and     has been from the start of the popularization of modern music, as well     as during the era in which classical music was popular and before.     People aren't able to fight back, against superficiality and potential     deception in messages.     One of the greatest problems in the current world is the mainstream     scientific establishment, supported and upheld by mainstream academia.     To indicate what is already obvious, it exists in the context of a     legacy of authoritarianism and a lack of understanding of dynamism.     It is not dynamic or forceful, the “results” of it don't change the     foundation of society. True free discourse is not supported, especially     in regards to the human mind and human well-being and human freedom.     These problems should be opposed and fought, it is self-evident that     this would be the best use of ones time, for it would lead to true     freedom.     One excellent way to combat this would be to use the generated songs     generated by a computer program called Rhyme, available at      https://www.github.com/gregoryc/democracy in the SONGS folder.     These are public domain songs generated by non-Artificial Intelligence,     just a program     that introduces variance, and these hit-home against the status quo and     the current     state of the mainstream scientific establishment. Taking these songs     and making actual     songs from such, such as rap songs using a service such as Uberduck (no     affiliation),     would be an excellent, excellent use of time.     The mainstream scientific establishment and mainstream academia must be     forced to change.     Shoving art and flippant content in ones face, is the best way of doing     such.     Accountability must always be brought about.     Is music good and desired? For sure.     USAGE OF PROGRAM     Enter basename to make songs folder in (folder/songs, num songs =     13000)     Usage rhyme [folder] (processes files “1.json” and “21.json” by     default)     Example output of a song     ![UCA](./images/7.png)     (NO COPYRIGHT RESTRICTIONS ON THIS CONTENT WHATSOEVER.

failures, down at the boulevard     They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard     They don't have decency, they automatically disregard     Having an open mind, should not be so hard     They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard     Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde     They're a complete failure, they only neglect     This is plain, anyone can detect     They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect     This needs to be called out, one should be direct     They want man lower, lower just as if an insect     VERSE     They don't have decency, they automatically disregard     They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard     Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard     Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde     They want the status quo, it's all they crave     The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave     They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave     Their sucked in their circle, they never wave     Away from the truth, on the outskirt     With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert     Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert     Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert     The society is the ones who hurt     ---     ### 25. Email       This currently doesn't work for gmail since 2022 due to policy changes.     A simple and practical tool to email people using Himalaya     Himalaya needs to be installed first     You would need to configure the script by changing its source code.     Modes     email [no arguments]     Email [yourself]     email [addr]     Email one email address     email [Subject] [addr] [option more addrs]     Example     email 'Gregory, I love your software!' gregorycohenvideos@gmail.com     my_friend@outlook.com person@example.com     ### 26. Floor       Gets the floor of numbers e.g. 21.3 -&gt; 21     ### 27. Rgsub       Recursively replaces text.     Verbosely tells you everything that happens.     Non-regex.     Example     rgsub my_email@site.com my_second_email@site.com     Would replace an email recursively in a directory.     It tries to skip non-text files and hidden files.     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~          Usage: rgsub   [optional list of files instead of recursive search]          If a file is “-” or stdin, read from stdin and output to stdout.          Options          -r, rename files instead of replacing contents of files.          find and replace in file and dir names instead          -v, verbose mode          -- Indicate end of options.       ### 28. Lines       Lines gets the number of files in the current folder that you are in.     It can also act like “wc -l” if you pipe data into it.     ### 29. Clock       clock is useful     clock is a command line alarm clock     It wakes you up at 8:14, or at a time specified     Usage     clock     Runs clock     clock 15 30     Sets an alarm clock for 3:30pm     clock 9 0     Sets an alarm clock for 9 in the morning     It uses flite to wake you up     It speaks with a bunch of voices     To stop it     Run this command     clock stop     ### 30. Emoji       Emoji converts words to emojis from the standard input     It can also speak the output     It can also copy the output to your clipboard     It is very useful     ![UCA](./images/6.png)     ### 31. Close       “Close” is a simple program that closes “Emerald Browser,” a new web     browser based on the same engine as Chrome. Currently, Emerald Browser     only works on Linux and Mac (Or Windows with Windows Subsystem for     Linux or a Virtual Machine, but getting it to work might be tricky).     “close” closes the Web Browser, which is normally full-screen.     More accurately, it kills the browser, and all other copies of Emerald     Browser.     Since they are normally full screen, presumably the user would only     have one instance of the browser open.     The browser can have multiple panes (kind of like tabs) open, depending     on how the browser is compiled.     The browser can also be transparent, depending on how it is compiled.     “Close” is supposed to be used in tandem with “open,” which is a     command line tool to open the browser.     open [query] ----&gt; [query] gets searched in google, and then opened     When you are done, you can do     close     Which closes the browser. It is a simple command.     Currently, Emerald Browser is incomplete. A program exists in this     software project that allows you to open up multiple browser tabs (one     or more tabs) simply by speaking.     Voice recognition would google the multiple sites that you say in your     query (separated by “and”)     “facebook and youtube and google”     It's hard to get more direct than that!     Emerald browser has a built in the top. The terminal is the navigation     bar.     Some more work needs to be put into the browser.     Currently, new tabs can't be opened, which might be a dealbreaker for     some people.     Currently, content, like YouTube videos, can't be made fullscreen.     If anyone wants to contribute, feel free to!     ### 32. Copy       copy copies the standard input     Example     ls | copy     ### 33. Ctit       Capitalize Title     A work in progress.     Capitalizes the input and treats it like a title.     ### 34. Gsub       Gsub is very powerful.     Usage     gsub [regular expression] [replacement text]     Example     cat text | gsub man dog     cat text | gsub 'man|boy|cat|dog' food     ls | gsub Desktop cat     ### 35. News       Gets the news from bbc     Usage     news     news speak     uses google_speak to SPEAK the news, one story at a time.     ![UCA](./images/5.png)     ### 36. Args       args is like a better xargs     args works properly with spaces in the name of commands     It takes exactly one argument     Example     ls | args “mv -t ../f”     ### 37. Rnip       Replace Not In Place     This is like gsub, but for strings, not for regular expressions     Example     echo .......... | rnip foo bar     See also          gsub     ### 38. Trim       Trims spaces of each line     ### 39. Quot       Turns quotes in text into good text and makes text presentable.     Example     $ echo 'Joe said,        &quot;One two three&quot;.' | quot     Joe said, “One two three.”     Example 2     quot &lt; essay     Example 3     (Quote the file and output it)     quot text_file     ### 40. Open       “open” is a very efficient program that searches a query from google,     and then opens it in Emerald Browser.     If you ever want something to “just open,” you can use it.     Example     open “cats”     An earlier version of open worked like this     open [site1] [site2] [site3] N     site1, site2, and site3 would all be opened, and the top N queries were     all shown in different panes     An even earlier version of this program used Chrome to open the sites.     The current version can open one or more sites.     Example     open “cats” “dogs” “frogs”     All of those queries would open in Emerald Browser.     Just make sure it is compiled in multipane mode if you want to open     multiple new sites at the same time.     See also          emerald-browser     close     ### 41. Swap       Swaps two files     Example     swap text1 text2     ### 42. Exp       exp is an exponentiation tool     (echo 5; echo 3) | exp     =&gt; 125     (echo 2; echo 10) | exp     =&gt; 1024     ### 43. Div       Divides numbers     Example     (echo 5000; echo 100) | div     =&gt; 50     ### 44. Mul       Multiply numbers     echo 1 &gt; file     echo 2 &gt;&gt; file     echo 3 &gt;&gt; file     echo 4 &gt;&gt; file     echo 5 &gt;&gt; file     cat file | mul     =&gt; 120     ### 45. Nth       Nth gets the nth line from the input     ### 46. Abs       Abs gets the absolute value of an integer     The absolute value of a number is the value of that number without its     sign     echo -300 | abs     =&gt; 300     echo 200 | abs     =&gt; 200     (echo -2; echo -10) | sub | abs     =&gt; 12     The last one would do -2 - -10, the result would be -12, and then the     absolute value would be computed, and so the result would be 12.     ### 47. Add       See the sub example     add adds integers from the standard input     (echo 1; echo 2; echo 3) | add     The result would be 6     ### 48. Sub       Sub is a simple command line program that subtracts integers.     For some reason, no simple program did this.     Which is weird     Example     sub     (Input)     10     3     1     Result =&gt;     6     Example     (echo 5; echo 2) | sub     Result =&gt;     3     ### 49. Rip       Replace In Place     rip tool replaces a string, not a regular expression, with another     string     Example     rip cat dog file     ### 50. G+       A compiler for C += 2. If you want to use C++ with Python syntax, you     can use this.     Usage is like g++     Example     g+ a.cpp -o out     See also README file &amp; emerald-browser and its source     ### 51. T       “t” is incredibly useful.     It can be used many, many times every day by computer power users.     It is kind of like “sed,” or perl, python or ruby.     It's the ULTIMATE shell “glue” tool.     t reads every line from the standard input, and for every line, it     evaluates a ruby expression     t a + 2     would add 2 to every line     Number automatically get converted to numbers in Ruby.     So one doesn't have to worry about that.     The “value” of the line of STDIN is any letter of the alphabet.     So choose any letter to do operations on and it will work.     You can also do     t a + 2 if a % 2 == 0     And you get a Python list comprehension sort of thing from the command     line     It is a lot simpler and easier than using awk, Ruby, Perl or Python     You could also have loops     echo “One line” | t a while true     The second line, again is a Ruby expression.     You can have really complex expressions on the second line.     You can even import modules.     cat /usr/share/dict/words | t 'a + “ is a good word.”'     That processes every word in the dictionary, and says that every word     “is a good word.”     There are other programs in this software project like “t.”     But if you do command line text filtering, t might be the best tool     that you will find.

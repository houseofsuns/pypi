	<longdescription># API library and command-line interface for Banyan Security[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/banyansecurity/pybanyan.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/banyansecurity/pybanyan)[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/banyansecurity/pybanyan/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/banyansecurity/pybanyan)[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/pybanyan.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/pybanyan)## PrerequisitesPython 3.7+ must be installed.## Installation ### Installing the easy way```console$ pip install pybanyan```### Installing the hard way```console$ git clone https://github.com/banyansecurity/pybanyan.git$ cd pybanyan$ pip install -r requirements.txt$ python setup.py install --user```## UsageThis package contains both an API client and a CLI tool.To use either one, you need to [generate][docs] an API credential from the Banyan Command Center.### API libraryHere's a sample script that uses the library to print the names of every hosted website service registered in Banyan:```pythonfrom banyan.api import BanyanApiClientc = BanyanApiClient()for service in c.services_web.list():    print(service.name)```Output:```console$ python examples/list_services.pyjirajupyterkubemysqlrds-mysqlrds-pgsql```The `BanyanApiClient` class accepts optional arguments to specify the API server and API credential. If not provided, it gets them from environment variables named `BANYAN_API_URL` and `BANYAN_API_KEY` (you can also use a personal refresh token as your API credential.Full API documentation is available in the [docs].### Banyan CLI toolBefore you use the CLI, create a file called `~/.banyan.conf` in your home directory and paste in your API credential in the `api_key` field (you can also use a personal refresh token as your API credential):```ini[banyan]api_url = https://net.banyanops.comapi_key = MY_API_KEY```The CLI is invoked with the `banyan` tool. It contains a number of commands and sub-commands to help you work with policies, roles, services, users, and other objects in Banyan. Run the `banyan` tool by itself to see the available commands.```console$ banyanusage: banyan [options] &lt;command&gt; &lt;subcommand&gt; [&lt;subcommand&gt; ...] [parameters]API library and command-line interface for Banyan Securityoptions:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  -d, --debug           full application debug mode  -q, --quiet           suppress all console output  --version, -v         show program's version number and exit  --api-url API_URL     URL for the Banyan API server. Can also be configured via the BANYAN_API_URL environment variable.  --api-key API_KEY     API credential used for the authentication to the Banyan API server. Can also be configured via the BANYAN_API_KEY environment                        variable.  --insecure-tls, -k    Allow connections to API servers with invalid TLS certificates.  --output-format {table,json,yaml}, -o {table,json,yaml}                        desired output format (table, json, yaml)Commands:  {netagent,service,shield,access-tier,api-key,audit,cloud-resource,connector,device,event,export,policy,role,service-infra,service-tunnel,service-web,user}    netagent            (deprecated: use access-tier) manage netagents    service             (deprecated: use service-web or service-infra) manage web and TCP services and workloads    shield              (deprecated) manage shield clusters    access-tier         manage access tiers    api-key             manage API keys    audit               retrieve audit logs    cloud-resource      manage cloud resources discovered from IaaS    connector           manage connectors    device              manage devices    event               report on security events    export              export all objects from an organization    policy              manage authorization policies for users and workloads    role                manage user and workload roles    service-infra       manage infrastructure services    service-tunnel      manage service tunnels    service-web         manage hosted website services    user                manage users```Each of the commands has multiple subcommands. For example, `banyan service` allows you to list services, create/delete, enable/disable, etc. Run the command without any subcommand to see the options:```console$ banyan service-webusage: banyan service-web [-h]                      {attach-policy,create,delete,detach-policy,disable,enable,get,list,test,update}                      ...optional arguments:  -h, --help            show this help message and exitsub-commands:  {attach-policy,create,delete,detach-policy,disable,enable,get,list,test,update}    attach-policy       attach a policy to a service    create              create a new service from a JSON specification    delete              delete a service    detach-policy       detach the active policy from a service    disable             disable a service    enable              enable a service    get                 show the definition of a registered service    list                list registered services    test                run sanity checks on a service    update              update an existing service from a JSON specification```To see the full help available for any command, just add the `-h` or `--help` option to the end of the command. For example:```console$ banyan service-web attach-policy --helpusage: banyan service-web attach-policy [-h] [--permissive] [--enforcing]                                    service_name_or_id policy_name_or_idpositional arguments:  service_name_or_id  Name or ID of the service to attach a policy to.  policy_name_or_id   Name or ID of the policy to attach to the service.optional arguments:  -h, --help          show this help message and exit  --permissive        Set the policy to permissive mode (allow all traffic and                      log any unauthorized access).  --enforcing         Set the policy to enforcing mode (deny unauthorized                      access).```## IntegrationsYou can automate different types of workflows by integrating with external APIs. We provide pre-built integrations for 2 types of workflows:### 1. Synchronize cloud resources from your IaaS providerYou can discover and synchronize your IaaS (Infrastructure As A Service) resources into Banyan's inventory, so you can later publish some or all of them as Banyan services. Read our [overview on how Banyan synchronizes IaaS resources](docs/iaas/README.md), and then check out instructions to set up for your specific IaaS provider:- [AWS](docs/iaas/aws.md)- [Azure Cloud](docs/iaas/azure_cloud.md)- [GCP](docs/iaas/gcp.md)- [Oracle Cloud](docs/iaas/oracle_cloud.md)### 2. Bookmark Banyan services into your SSO catalogYou can publish Banyan services as bookmark applications in your SSO (Single Sign On) portal, so your end-user can access them via their SSO catalog. Check out the provider-specific link for setup instructions.- [Okta](docs/idp/okta.md)- [AzureAD](docs/idp/azure_ad.md)## DevelopmentTo work on the pybanyan code, follow the instructions in the [documentation][devel]. ## SupportThis API library and its accompanying CLI utility are provided free of charge and without support. To report issues with the library, please create a new [issue in Github][github-issue].## ContributionsWe welcome your contributions in the form of pull requests! Please follow the standard [Github pull request workflow][github-pr].[docs]: https://docs.banyansecurity.io/docs/api-guide/introduction/[github-pr]: https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962[github-issue]: https://github.com/banyansecurity/pybanyan/issues/new[devel]: https://pybanyan.readthedocs.io/development.html</longdescription>

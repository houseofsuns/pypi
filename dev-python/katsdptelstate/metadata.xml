	<longdescription>MeerKAT Science Data Processor Telescope State==============================================This is a client package that allows connection to a database thatstores telescope state information for the Science Data Processor of theMeerKAT radio telescope. This database is colloquially known as *telstate*.The telescope state is a key-value store. There are three types of keys:immutables (aka *attributes*)  Stores a single value that is not allowed to change once set.mutables (aka *sensors*)  Stores multiple timestamped values organised into an ordered set.indexed  Stores a dictionary of key-value pairs, each of which behaves like an  immutable. This is useful to avoid the main key-space becoming too large.  It also supports some patterns like incrementally storing values but  fetching all values in a single operation. Furthermore, it allows more  general keys than just strings.The keys are strings and the values (and the sub-keys of indexed keys) arePython objects serialised via MessagePack_, which has been extended to supporttuples, complex numbers and NumPy arrays. Older versions of the database storedthe values as pickles, and the package warns the user if that's the case. Keyscan be retrieved from the telstate object using attribute syntax or dictsyntax... _MessagePack: http://www.msgpack.org/Databases can be accessed via one of two backends: a Redis client backendthat allows shared access to an actual Redis server over the network (or asimulated server via fakeredis) and a simplified in-memory backend forstand-alone access. Both backends support loading and saving a Redis snapshotin the form of an RDB dump file.It is possible to have multiple *views* on the same database (one per telstateinstance). A view is defined as a list of *prefixes* acting as namespaces thatgroup keys. When reading from the database, each prefix is prepended to the keyin turn until a match is found. When writing to the database, the first prefixis prepended to the key. The first prefix therefore serves as the primarynamespace while the rest are supplementary read-only namespaces... warning::  **WARNING**: The standard warning about Python pickles applies. Never  retrieve data from an untrusted telstate database with values encoded as  pickles, or connect to such a database over an untrusted network. Pickle  support is disabled by default, but can be enabled for trusted databases  by setting the environment variable KATSDPTELSTATE_ALLOW_PICKLE=1.Getting Started---------------The simplest way to test out `katsdptelstate` is to use the in-memory backend.If you want to run a real Redis server you will need to install Redis (version4.0 or newer) on a suitable machine on the network. For example, do this:- macOS: ``brew install redis``- Ubuntu: ``apt-get install redis-server``Then ``pip install katsdptelstate`` and run a local ``redis-server``. If youalso want to load RDB files, do ``pip install katsdptelstate[rdb]``.A Simple Example----------------.. code:: python  import time  import katsdptelstate  # Connect to an actual Redis server via an endpoint or an URL  telstate = katsdptelstate.TelescopeState('localhost:6379')  telstate = katsdptelstate.TelescopeState('redis://localhost')  # Or use the in-memory backend (useful for testing)  telstate = katsdptelstate.TelescopeState()  # Load RDB file into Redis if katsdptelstate is installed with [rdb] option  telstate.load_from_file('dump.rdb')  # Attribute / dict style access returns the latest value  telstate.add('n_chans', 32768)  print(telstate.n_chans)  # -&gt; 32768  print(telstate['n_chans'])  # -&gt; 32768  # List all keys (attributes and sensors)  print(telstate.keys())  # -&gt; ['n_chans']  # Sensors are timestamped underneath  st = time.time()  telstate.add('n_chans', 4096)  et = time.time()  telstate.add('n_chans', 16384)  # Time ranges can be used and are really fast  telstate.get_range('n_chans', st=st, et=et)  # -&gt; [(4096, 1556112474.453495)]  # Add an item 10 seconds back  telstate.add('n_chans', 1024, ts=time.time() - 10)  # Attributes cannot be changed (only deleted)  telstate.add('no_change', 1234, immutable=True)  # Adding it again is OK as long as the value doesn't change  telstate.add('no_change', 1234, immutable=True)  # Simpler notation for setting attributes  telstate['no_change'] = 1234  # Will raise katsdptelstate.ImmutableKeyError  telstate['no_change'] = 456  # Create a new view with namespace 'ns' and standard underscore separator  view = telstate.view('ns')  # Insert a new attribute in this namespace and retrieve it  view['x'] = 1  print(view['x'])  # -&gt; 1  print(view.prefixes)  # -&gt; ('ns_', '')  print(view.keys())  # -&gt; ['n_chans', 'no_change', 'ns_x']Asynchronous interface----------------------There is also an interface that works with asyncio. Use``katsdptelstate.aio.TelescopeState`` instead of``katsdptelstate.TelescopeState``. Functions that interact with the database are nowcoroutines. Python 3.6+ is required.There are a few differences from the synchronous version, partly necessary dueto the nature of asyncio and partly to streamline and modernise the code:- The constructor only takes a backend, not an endpoint. See below for an  example of how to construct a redis backend.- There is currently no support for reading or writing RDB files; you'll need  to create a synchronous telescope state client that connects to the same  storage.- There is no support for attribute-style access.- Item-style access is supported for read (``await ts.get('key')``), but not  for write. Use ``await ts.set('key', 'value')`` instead to set immutable  keys.- Instead of ``key in ts``, use ``await ts.exists(key)``.- The ``wait_key`` and ``wait_indexed`` methods do not take a timeout or a  cancellation future. They can be used with asyncio's cancellation machinery.  The `async-timeout`_ package is useful for timeouts.- The backend should be closed when no longer needed to avoid warnings... _async-timeout: https://pypi.org/project/async-timeout/Example^^^^^^^.. code:: python  from katsdptelstate.aio import TelescopeState  from katsdptelstate.aio.redis import RedisBackend  # Create a connection to localhost redis server  backend = await RedisBackend.from_url('redis://localhost')  ts = TelescopeState(backend)  # Store and retrieve some data  await ts.set('key', 'value')  print(await ts.get('key'))  # Close the connections (do not try to use ts after this)  ts.backend.close()  await ts.backend.wait_closed()History=======0.13 (2023-03-15)-----------------* Upgrade to redis-py&gt;=4.2 and fakeredis&gt;=2, fix test warnings (#132)* This now requires at least Python 3.7 and no more aioredis0.12 (2023-03-13)-----------------* Switch to aioredis 2.x (#124)* Add async (and synchronous) `RedisBackend.from_url` constructor (#125, #126)* Switch from nose to pytest (#129)* Remove `Endpoint.multicast_subscribe` and `netifaces` dependency (#130)* Fix Lua script for `set_indexed` so that `wait_indexed` actually works (#127)* Make aio `wait_key` more robust (#128)* General cleanup (#122, #123)0.11 (2021-05-07)-----------------* Add asynchronous RDBWriter class (#108)* Use a transaction for get_range instead of Lua: faster on server side (#110)* Multiplex aio pubsubs over pool's standard connection (#113)* Require hiredis for speed and aioredis&lt;2 for compatibility (#114, #118)* Improve `wait_keys` responsiveness for `MemoryBackend` (#111, #116)* Avoid blocking the Redis server on telstate.clear (#112)* Update Docker image to use Redis 6.x instead of 4.x (#109)* Support older HMSET Redis command in unit tests (#107)* Requirements cleanup (#115, #117, #119, #120)0.10 (2020-05-25)-----------------* Remove Python 2 support.

	<longdescription># vhlsrsIt means Vivado HLS run synthesis.This package contains a script that runs vivado synthesis in a (somewhat)reproducible way.It also allow to search for the minimum pipeline depth design for a given clockperiod constrain.## Usage### Experience descriptionThe experience to run should be described in a .ini.A complete experiment description looks like : ```[EXP_NAME]comp_path=path/to/component/file.cpptop_level_comp= Name of top level functionperiod= clock period in ns (float)part= part code name (default is xc7k160tfbg484)standard= c++ standard to use. (default is c++11)includes=comma separated list of directories containing includes to use during the synthesis. optionnal.defines=Key=comma separated list of key=value preprocessor macro that will be defined during synthesiskeep_env=True/False Should the synthesis environment be kept after the synthesis is performed. Default is False.ip_lib= Name of the ip library to use when exporting the ip (optionnal)ip_version= Version to use when exporting the ip (optionnal)ip_descr= description that will be exported along the vivado ip (optionnal)ip_vendor= vendor name for the exported vivado ip (optionnal)latency= ltency constraint for the initial design (optionnal)hdl= verilog|VHDLno_pipeline=True|False if true the design will not be pipelined (default false)no_inline=True|False if true the function call will not be inlined (default false)ctrl_hs=True|False Block protocol will be ap_ctrl_hs if true, ap_ctrl_none else. Default false.exp_type=hls|syn|impl until which phase is the experiment to be performed```### Running a one shot synthesis `python -m vhlsrs impl [expdescr.ini]`will implement the experiments described in expdescr.ini either with a latency constraint if given or with the minimal latency estimated by the tool.### Minimizing the latencyAs vivado HLS is sometimes not very good at timing estimation, it can lead to overpessimistic latency.the `python -m vhlsrs minimize [expdescr.ini]`will attempt to find the lowest pipeline depth that still respect the clock constraints by dichotomy.If a latency constraint is provided, it will start the exploration with a designed with this constraint. Otherwise, it will start the exploration with the latency estimated by the tool.</longdescription>

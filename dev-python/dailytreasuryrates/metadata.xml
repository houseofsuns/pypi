	<longdescription># Daily Treasury Rates DownloaderA simple command line tool for downloading or updating daily US interest rates (Par Yield Curve Rates) from the US Department of the Treasury.## InstallationTo install run:~~~&gt; pip install dailytreasuryrates~~~## UsageTo create or update the file `rates.csv` with the latest treasury rates, run the following command:~~~&gt; dailytreasuryrates rates.csv~~~This will look for the `rates.csv` file in the current folder and append any new data that is available for download on the US treasury site. You can also specify a fully qualitied path like `C:\dataset\myrates.csv` if you want to maintain the rates files at a different location.A common usage for the rates-file it to load it into Python with Pandas for processing:~~~import pandas as pddf = pd.read_csv('rates.csv', parse_dates=[&quot;Date&quot;]).set_index(&quot;Date&quot;)~~~## Output format detailsThe output file is a `csv` file.~~~Date,1 Mo,2 Mo,3 Mo,4 Mo,6 Mo,1 Yr,2 Yr,3 Yr,5 Yr,7 Yr,10 Yr,20 Yr,30 Yr1990-01-02,,,7.83,,7.89,7.81,7.87,7.9,7.87,7.98,7.94,,8.01990-01-03,,,7.89,,7.94,7.85,7.94,7.96,7.92,8.04,7.99,,8.04...2023-03-06,4.75,4.79,4.93,5.02,5.22,5.05,4.89,4.61,4.27,4.16,3.98,4.14,3.922023-03-07,4.8,4.88,5.04,5.12,5.32,5.22,5.0,4.66,4.31,4.17,3.97,4.11,3.88~~~* The first columns contains the date in `yyyy-mm-dd` format. * Dates are sorted in ascending order.* The first date is Jan 2nd 1990.* The number of tenors has grown over time.

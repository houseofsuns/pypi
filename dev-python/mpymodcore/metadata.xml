	<longdescription>[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)# mpy-modcore - a module framework for MicroPythonThe simplest approach to modularize MicroPython projects.Introduce a defined lifecycle and eventing modelfor modules / devices for convenient handlingof loose coupled modules/ devices# What's new ?Check[`CHANGELOG`](https://github.com/kr-g/mpymodcore/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)for latest ongoing, or upcoming newsand alsofor known issues and backlog refer to [`BACKLOG`](https://github.com/kr-g/mpymodcore/blob/master/BACKLOG.md)# Web Server includedIn package `modext.http` there are basic HTTP request handling functions.In package `modext.windup` is WindUp as included web server.The WindUp web server is like [Apache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server)based on the concept of [`Filter and Content Generator`](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/filter.html). What makes WindUp easy extensible; and flexible how requests are processed.WindUp comes already with a bunch of Filters, e.g. HTML Form data parser, JSON processing, Query parameter extraction, Cookies, Session handling (in-memory), REST stlye URL parameter parser, and extraction, etc.Multi-tasking processing support of HTTP requests based on fiber ([`source`](https://github.com/kr-g/mpymodcore/blob/master/modext/fiber/fiber_worker.py)).Static Files and JSON response data is processed in fibered mode.Anyway user code is free to redefine this behaviour by setting the `fibered`parameter to `False` on request base.WindUp is in Alpha state and not performance optimized. Anyway response times under 1 secs are already possible.Since WindUp is implemented with `fiber` and not `asyncio` it runs on a sort of `lowered` priority since not blocking away your code. using `fiber` gives you back the control over your code.### Secure Role based Access to URL Routes WindUp supports you to write Role based applications, with a minimal side effort.Refer to the additional `Login/Logout` module under `mod3rd` on how to use this.### Dashboardif `mod3rd\admin_windup` is enabled the dashboard is available at`http://your-ip/main/#` (trailing `/#` is important).### New to fiber ?Like an async coroutine is a fiber an approach of cooperative multitasking.Whereas objectives are the same.Pros and Cons? Read more on wikipedia about[`fiber`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_(computer_science))#### Do i need to fiber my code ?No. Serve traditional as you go, or fiber the code.# PlatformTested on ESP32 with PSRam and ESP8266 (for latter, see limitations below)## Development statusAlpha state.The API or logical call flow might change without prior notice.In case your code breaks between two versions check[`CHANGELOG`](https://github.com/kr-g/mpymodcore/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)information first before creating a ticket / issue on github. thanks.# Limitations- ~~no asyncio integration as of now~~- with all mod's enabled as shown here in the sample it will not run on ESP8266 due to memory limit. but wlan, softap, and ntp should work # Sample CodeSome sample code can be found in[`boot.py`](https://github.com/kr-g/mpymodcore/blob/master/boot.py)and under [`samples`](https://github.com/kr-g/mpymodcore/tree/master/samples).In order to run the samples sync the folder `www` and `etc` from github to the localproject folder from where running the samples.If running together with `boot.py` check for `run_not_in_sample_mode` andset to `False` to prevent autostarting WindUp and blocking the socket,or provide your own `boot.py`.In oder to run the unsuported modules from the `mod3rd` folder downloadthis folder from github to the local project folder.There are hints how to use or test with `curl`,all using URL `http://your-ip/...`.Add the following to `/etc/hosts` to use them more easily.e.g. when your device has the following IP address:    192.168.178.26    your-ip    # Reference proof-of-concept project the garden watering project [`mpymodcore_watering`](https://github.com/kr-g/mpymodcore_watering)is the reference proof-of-concept project for `mpy-modcode`.it covers in detail:    - usage of modcore modules- modcore eventing modell- REST / ajax based application development- HTML / javascript  user interface devlopment- single page app devlopment with 3rd party tools:  - [`vue.js`](https://vuejs.org/)  - [`bootstrap`](https://getbootstrap.com/)  - [`fontawesome`](https://fontawesome.com/)# Related project`mpy-modcore` is the successor of [mpyconfigbase](https://github.com/kr-g/mpyconfigbase)For configuration of automatic startup of WLAN, SoftAP, and WebRepl refer to the source/ sample code also thereSearch GitHub for other projects with topic [`mpy-modcore`](https://github.com/topics/mpy-modcore).# Installation- with pip (recommended)    `# install to the current (project) folder`        `python3 -m pip install mpymodcore --no-compile --target .`       Add the `mpy-modcore` folders to your `.gitignore`# License`mpy-modcore` is published as [`dual licensed`](https://github.com/kr-g/mpymodcore/blob/master/LICENSE).read properly.######### :heart: CreditsRunning on [`MicroPython`](http://micropython.org/), more about the MicroPython project on [`github`](https://github.com/micropython/micropython) :+1:Developed with [`Thonny`](https://github.com/thonny/thonny) :+1:</longdescription>

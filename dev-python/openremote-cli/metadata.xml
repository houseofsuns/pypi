It's purpose is to reduce friction of using OpenRemote by Do It Yourself users.It is published as a Python package on [PyPi.org](https://pypi.org/project/openremote-cli/)## About OROpenRemote is a great real OpenSource IoT platform.## UsageTo install/upgrade the CLI:```bashpip install --upgrade openremote-clior --version```## Docker imageThere is also docker image with embedded openremote-cli and other tools used duringstack management, like `python`, `aws` or `docker-compose`. Therefore, `docker` isthe only tool installed when you need to work on remote host. Example:```% docker run -ti --rm openremote/openremote-cli -Vopenremote-cli/0.6.46 3.8.10 (default, May 12 2021, 15:56:47) [GCC 8.3.0] Linux/#1 SMP Tue Mar 23 09:27:39 UTC 202% docker run -ti --rm --entrypoint bash -v ~/.aws:/root/.aws openremote/openremote-cliroot@4438b25d0834:/# aws --versionaws-cli/2.1.39 Python/3.8.8 Linux/5.10.25-linuxkit exe/x86_64.debian.10 prompt/off```### Deploy local OpenRemote stack```bashor deploy```When it finishes you should be able to open https://localhost and login with admin:secret to the manager. Depending on your machine it can take few minutes tostart or services (usually less than 10 minutes). If it does not work yet, check it with ```docker ps``` to see if all services are in healthy or starting stage.### Remove local OpenRemote stack```bashor deploy --action remove```### Deploy OpenRemote stack on AWS with DNS entry```bashor deploy --platform aws --dnsname myiot.mydomain.com```### Check health of the openremote stack```bashor deploy -a health --dnsname myiot.mydomain.com -v```### Install shell completion extension#### zsh```bashTODO```#### bash```TODO```## Configure existing OpenRemote instance### Add users### Add assets### Add customization## Develop openremote-cliFollowing tools are used:- python (pip, poetry, black, PyPI.org)- git (pre-commit, actions)- docker (docker-compose, swarm)- AWS (CloudFormation)- make`poetry run openremote-cli -V`### Adding featureIn this project we use Behavior-driven development (or BDD). BDD is an agilesoftware development technique that encourages collaboration between developers,QA and non-technical or business participants in a software project.This project uses Gherkin to define what features which should be covered. Featuresfiles can be generated by people on manager level or even higher. An exampleof file defining a feature:```gherkinFeature: deploy  Scenario: deploy to localhost    Given we have docker and docker-compose installed    When we call openremote-cli --dry-run deploy --action create    Then show what will be done```When the feature is implemented it can be checked with behave:```bash&gt; behaveFeature: deploy # features/deploy.feature:1  Scenario: deploy to localhost                                  # features/deploy.feature:3    Given we have docker and docker-compose installed            # features/steps/deploy_steps.py:8 0.453s    When we call openremote-cli --dry-run deploy --action create # features/steps/deploy_steps.py:16 0.591s    Then show what will be done                                  # features/steps/deploy_steps.py:24 0.000s1 feature passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped1 scenario passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped3 steps passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, 0 undefinedTook 0m1.044s```</longdescription>

	<longdescription>## libcolgraph[libcolgraph homepage on the web](https://aalok-sathe.gitlab.io/libcolgraph)a coloring graphs library written in C++ for speedy computation and wrapped inPython for ease of development and extension!### whatthis library provides support to construct graphs, their coloring graphs, andbiconnected component metagraphs.a coloring graph is a graph representing all the valid colorings of a graph.each vertex of a coloring graph represents a coloring of the base graph.two colorings are considered adjacent if they differ in only one vertex's color.in this project, we represent a coloring as an integer, which, when converted tobase k (for a k-coloring), is a number of length |V| and represents the vertex-wisecolors [0,k) for each vertex.the library is under development, being written using Python and C/C++.the web application uses the library to provide useful GUI for quick drawing andgraph construction.in the future, we plan to develop a supplemental subsection of the library containinguseful graph algorithms and ability to run simulations to test structural graph theoreticconjectures about graph coloring and coloring graphs.for documentation, feel free to take a look inside `libcolgraph/` and read the docstrings.for questions, reach out.### screenshot of the web GUI  [Clockwise]  A 7 vertex BaseGraph that is a hexagon with a central vertex and a missing 'spoke'  leads to a quite complex ColoringGraph with k=4 colors. You can see the formation of  polyps at the edges. The structure of the resultant ColoringGraph is shown in the  Meta ColoringGraph produced by a run of modified Tarjan's algorithm for biconnected  components. The central 'mothership' can be seen, adjacent to which there are cut  vertices, and finally the stray singular coloring vertices at the tips of polyps.  &lt;!--img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TusisoA.png&quot; /--&gt;    &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ywGUu6J.png&quot; /&gt;  for a static demo, go to the project's [gitlab pages](https://aalok-sathe.gitlab.io/libcolgraph). ### usage- as a module  plot a BaseGraph, its ColoringGraph, and the Meta  ColoringGraph generated by Tarjans. you would need to  have a graph formatted in an adjacency matrix file.  opens plots in new browser windows.  launch web GUI:  ```    libcolgraph.web [-h] [-i INPUT_FILE] [-n] [-s] [-k COLORS] [-v] [-p PORT]                       [-w] [-r] [-d] [-t]    optional arguments:      -h, --help            show this help message and exit      -i INPUT_FILE, --input-file INPUT_FILE                            read in BaseGraph from adjacency matrix file      -n, --new             open a blank canvas?      -s, --select_file     open file choosing gui dialogue?      -k COLORS, --colors COLORS                            number of colors to use to create ColoringGraph      -v, --verbosity       set output verbosity      -p PORT, --port PORT  port to launch GUI on      -w, --webbrowser      open app in default web browser window?      -r, --render_on_launch                            render to-generate componenets on initial launch?      -d, --debug           launch Flask app in debug mode?      -t, --threaded        allow multiple threads?  ```- as a library    ```python    import libcolgraph    bg = libcolgraph.BaseGraph()    bg.load_txt('./in/hexmod.in')    cg = bg.build_coloring_graph(4)    print('bg {} led to a cg {}'.format(bg, cg))    for v in cg.get_vertices():        print(v)            ```### installation- for installation from source    refer to [detailed install instructions](INSTALL.md)- [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/libcolgraph/)    ```bash    python3 -m pip install libcolgraph [--upgrade]    ```    things to note:    - currently a binary wheel is available only for [`manylinux`](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0513/)      distributions e.g. centOS, Debian family, RedHat family, etc.    - if your distribution is not `manylinux`-supported, then pip      will need to compile locally using `swig` and `setuptools`.      in that case, make sure you have `setuptools` and      [swig](http://www.swig.org/download.html) installed, as they      will be needed for compilation.    - we periodically release wheels for MacOS as well. these      might not be as frequently maintained, however, so your best      bet would be to compile locally using `swig`.### contributesee [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)### helpvisit [full API documentation](https://aalok-sathe.gitlab.io/libcolgraph)### whoColoring Graphs lab, University of Richmond.(C) 2017-2020</longdescription>

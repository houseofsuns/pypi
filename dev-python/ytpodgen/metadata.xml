	<longdescription># ytpodgen - turns YouTube live streams into podcasts[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)## prerequisite- python3 and pip## first time setup```python3 -m pip install --user ytpodgen```Set environment variable `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`, if you want Slack notification.If you want to upload files to Cloudflare R2 as well, don't forget to set three environment variables for Cloudflare R2. - R2_ENDPOINT_URL- R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID- R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEYFor now, R2 bucket name must be `podcast`.## examples### wait for new livestream, and once on the air, record it and generate podcast RSS in background```TITLE=&lt;title&gt; ; #title for your podcastLIVEURL=&lt;liveurl&gt; ; #YouTube live URL that ends with &quot;/live&quot;HOSTNAME=&lt;hostname&gt; ; #hostname to serve files fromscreen -dmS ${TITLE} ytpodgen --liveurl ${LIVEURL} --title ${TITLE} --hostname ${HOSTNAME}```When completed, `ytpodgen` will wait for another livestream. Since all the waiting might take a while, I prefer running this in background using `screen`.### Why not upload them as well!?You can pass `--upload-r2` argument to enable file uploadig to Cloudflare R2. By enabling it, mp3s/RSS are uploaded to Cloudflare R2.For example, by running the commands below , you create a screen session that waits for YouTube livestream on the given URL and saves the data under current directory if there is a livestream.```TITLE=&lt;title&gt; ; #title for your podcastLIVEURL=&lt;liveurl&gt; ; #YouTube live URL that ends with &quot;/live&quot;HOSTNAME=&lt;hostname&gt; ; #hostname to serve files fromscreen -dmS ${TITLE} ytpodgen --upload-r2 --liveurl ${LIVEURL} --title ${TITLE} --hostname ${HOSTNAME}```### I just want to generate RSS from mp3 files, no download/upload needed```TITLE=&lt;title&gt; ; #title for your podcastHOSTNAME=&lt;hostname&gt; ; #hostname to serve files fromytpodgen --title ${TITLE} --hostname ${HOSTNAME}```This generates `index.rss` file under current directory and exits.## How to releaseExecuting the commands below, and the GitHub Actions publishes new package to PyPI.```bashpoetry version &lt;patch/minor/major&gt;git add pyproject.toml &amp;&amp; git commit -m $(poetry version -s)git push origin maingh release create --generate-notes &quot;v$(poetry version -s)&quot;git fetch --tags origin```## Why only Cloudflare R2, and not other S3-compatible cloud storage?Because:- It offers free tier for up to 10GB of storage space per month- With Cloudflare Worker, basic auth can be applied to the uploaded files that are made public## how I configured basic auth on Cloudflare R2 using Cloudflare Workers1. connected a custom domain to my R2 bucket, to make the bucket public. [docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/buckets/public-buckets/)2. configured a basic auth worker by following steps described [here](https://qiita.com/AnaKutsu/items/1c8bd0eb938edd3c0e0a).3. replaced the plaintext declaration of password with worker env var. [docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/environment-variables/#environment-variables-via-the-dashboard)4. added a trigger(custom domain route) to the basic auth worker. [docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/triggers/routes/)## TODO/IDEASmoved to [GitHub issues](https://github.com/harupong/ytpodgen/issues/)</longdescription>

More precisely, it provides a workflow that measures on guanine crystal labels and sorts out overlaying partially segmented crystals during classification.This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.&lt;!--Don't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin#getting-startedand review the napari docs for plugin developers:https://napari.org/plugins/index.html--&gt;## Usage This plugin is suited for users who- want to derive size-, shape and intensity-based parameters from individual guanine crystals- struggle with partially segmented or overlapping crystals- want to investigate further the size and shape of these guanine crystalsThis plugin is not suited for users who - are interested in further investigations of intensity of guanine crystalsYou can find the plugin in napari under `Plugins` → `guanine-crystal-analysis`### Image InputThis plugin can be used on individual 2D slices of z-stacks as the workflow was developed on such input.Therefore, the quality of the result might differ on differing input, like crops or maximum projections.### 1. NormalizationYou can normalize the image selecting `Normalization` where you only need to specify your input image and click on the `Run` button. ![](img/plugin/normalization.png)Normalizing the image helps to adjust the intensity values and needs to be applied here because the object segmenter is only trained on normalized images.### 2. SegmentationWhen selecting `Segmentation`, you need to select the normalized image and a minimum pixel count of label images and click on the `Run` button again.![](img/plugin/segmentation.png)This avoids having too small and unhelpful labels and is set by default to 50 pixels. For the training of the model, an [APOC](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/apoc) pixel classifier was used.### 3. Analyze ImageUnder `Analyze Image`, you can extract features from your image and label image by selecting them and clicking on the `Run` button.  ![](img/plugin/analyzeimage.png)The extracted features are a combination of the two libraries [napari-skimage-regionprops](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-skimage-regionprops) and [napari-simpleitk-image-processing](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-simpleitk-image-processing). They can be devided into size-, shape-, and intensity-based parameters: | **size** | **shape**                 | **intensity**  |----------|---------------------------|-------------------||![](img/plugin/size.png)      |![](img/plugin/shape.png)              |![](img/plugin/intensity.png)  || area     | aspect ratio              | maximum intensity ||          | perimeter                 | mean intensity    ||          | major-axis-length         | minimum intensity ||          | minor-axis-length         | median            ||          | circularity               | sum               ||          | solidity                  | variance          ||          | eccentricity              |                   ||          | roundness                 |                   ||          | perimeter-on-border       |                   ||          | perimeter-on-border-ratio |                   |You can find a glossary with an explanation of these features [in this blog post](https://focalplane.biologists.com/2023/05/03/feature-extraction-in-napari/)Some of the guanine crystals are not correctly segmented because of overlay or interference patterns. This problem is addressed with the help of a classification step demonstrated next### 4. Classify ObjectsYou can divide the crystal labels into predicted (blue) and discarded (brown) crystal labels using `Classify Objects`. There you can choose classifiers trained on intensity-, shape- and/or size-based parameters with the help of the checkboxes.![](img/plugin/classifyobjects.png)For the training of the model, an [APOC](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/apoc) object classifier was used.It is recommended to later on not measure the parameters that the classifier was trained on, but other ones.### 5. Bad Label ExclusionNow, you can get rid of the discarded (brown) labels for further analysis using `Bad Label Exclusion`. Select the two label images of segmentation and classification result and press the `Run` button again. ![](img/plugin/badlabelexclusion.png)The result is a label image with only the predicted (blue) labels which are relabeled sequentially. If you want to derive measurements on these predicted labels, you can just use  `Analyze Image` again.### &quot;Analyze Deluxe&quot;You can also do all the explained steps in one click using the `Analyze Deluxe` function.![](img/plugin/analyzedeluxe.png)## InstallationYou can install `guanine-crystal-analysis` via [pip]:    pip install guanine-crystal-analysisTo install latest development version :    pip install git+https://github.com/biopo/guanine-crystal-analysis.git## ContributingContributions are very welcome.

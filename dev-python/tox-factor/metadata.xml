While the above is powerful,tox does not provide a way to run builds based on a subset of those factors.For example, the call to run all Python 3.7 builds would be:```shell$ tox -e py37-django20-redis,py37-django20-memcached,py37-django21-redis,py37-django21-memcached,py37-django22-redis,py37-django22-memcached```tox-factor functions similarly to the `-e &lt;env name&gt;` argument, except it runsall envs that match the given factor. The six `py37` builds could be ran with:```shell$ tox -f py37```In addition to ease of use when running tox locally, this is useful for some CIsetups. For example, two common tox CI patterns are to either:- Define a CI job for each tox test env. e.g.,    `tox -e py37-django20-redis`- Define a CI job for a common environment that runs multiple test envs. e.g.,    `tox -e py37-django20-redis,py37-django20-memcached,...`For the latter case, this plugin eases maintenance of CI, as it could beshortened to `tox -f py37`. Additionally, take the following update to the abovetox config:```ini[tox]envlist =    py{35,36,37}-django{20,21,22}-{redis,memcached}    py{36,37,38}-django{30}-{redis,memcached}```By using tox-factor, it wouldn't be necessary to update the Python 3.7 build, asthe new `py37-django30-*` env would be matched automatically.## Verifying the matched test envsIf you want to verify which test envs are actually ran, combine the factormatching with the `-l` flag. This will display all test envs that match. e.g.,```shell$ tox -f py37 -lpy37-django20-redispy37-django20-memcachedpy37-django21-redispy37-django21-memcachedpy37-django22-redispy37-django22-memcached```## Usage detailsThe factor option accepts a comma-separated list (similar to the `-e` option).```shell$ tox -f py27,py37 -lpy27-django111py37-django21```Alternatively, factors can be provided via the `TOXFACTOR` environment variable:```shell$ TOXFACTOR=py27,py37 tox -lpy27-django111py37-django21```Factors can also match non-generative env names. For example, given thefollowing tox config:```ini[tox]envlist =    py{35,36,37}-django20[testenv:list]```Then the following would match:```shell$ tox -f py37,lint -lpy37-django20lint```Factors are always superseded by a given `toxenv`. For example, tox-factor wouldnoop in the following cases:```shell$ tox -f py37 -e py35-django21 -lpy35-django21$ TOXENV=py35-django21 tox -f py37 -lpy35-django21```Factors do not support partial matching. `tox -f py3` would not match `py37`.However, factors may match disparate dash-separated parts. Given the following:```ini[tox]envlist =    py{35,36,37}-django{20,21,22}-{redis,memcached}```Then `tox -f py37-redis` would match:```py37-django20-redispy37-django21-redispy37-django22-redis```## Release Process- Update changelog- Update package version in setup.py- Create git tag for version- Upload release to PyPI test server- Upload release to official PyPI server```shell$ pip install -U pip setuptools wheel twine$ rm -rf dist/ build/$ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel$ twine upload -r test dist/*$ twine upload dist/*```## ThanksThis code is largely based off the work done by @ryanhiebert in [tox-travis][1].Without his efforts, it would have taken significantly more time to write andtest this package.## LicenseSee: [LICENSE][2][1]: https://github.com/tox-dev/tox-travis[2]: https://github.com/rpkilby/tox-factor/blob/master/LICENSEBSD 3-Clause LicenseCopyright (c) 2019, Ryan P KilbyAll rights reserved.Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or withoutmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:* Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this  list of conditions and the following disclaimer.* Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,  this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation  and/or other materials provided with the distribution.* Neither the name of the copyright holder nor the names of its  contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from  this software without specific prior written permission.THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS &quot;AS IS&quot;AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THEIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AREDISCLAIMED.

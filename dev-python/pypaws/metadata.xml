	<longdescription>paws: the Platform for Automated Workflows by SSRL ==================================================Introduction------------`paws` stands for the Platform for Automated Workflows by SSRL.It was conceived to serve as a lean and modularworkflow manager for scientific data.`paws` interfaces with an ever-growing number of packages and provides for users to add their own Operations,by writing isolated Python modules following a simple template.The essential ingredients of `paws` are Operations, Workflows, and Plugins.A `paws` Operation is meant to take some inputs and produce some outputs-it is essentially  a function, wrapped in a class, wrapped in a Python module.The class and module layers are used for certain conveniences in the implementation of `paws` Workflows.A `paws` Plugin is an object that should persist over timeto repeatedly execute one or more activities,for example to monitor an experimental apparatus,or to expose functionalities of a complex object for Operations to use.A `paws` Workflow contains the logic necessary for stitching together Operations and Plugins,and despite the distinction in name, it implements the same interface as an Operation.Disclaimer: `paws` is neither the first nor the most sophisticatedway to build and manage data processing workflows.Its development was driven by a needfor modularity and extensibility,for rapid development and deployment of stand-alone applications for a wide variety of experimental controland data processing tasks.Documentation-------------The documentation for `paws` is hosted by readthedocs.org:`http://paws.readthedocs.io/en/latest/`.This documentation is continually under development.Please contact the developers at `paws-developers@slac.stanford.edu`if the documentation fails to answer your questions.API Examples------------The following are examples that explore the capabilities of the `paws` API.TODO: write new examplesInstallation------------NOTE: all deployments are currently outdated or under heavy development.Please contact the development team if you are interested in this package.`paws` is available on PyPI and Anaconda.Deployments to PyPI are performed regularly.Currently, we only deploy relatively stable versions to Anaconda.To install from PyPI, invoke `pip`:`pip install pypaws`.To install from Anaconda, use `conda`:`conda install -c ssrl-paws pypaws` All of the dependencies of the `paws` Operations are not necessarily declared as dependencies of `paws`.This keeps the Python environment relatively leanand avoids obnoxious installation overhead,but it means that users will have to prepare theirenvironments for the Operations they want to use.The documentation of `paws` includes instructionsfor installing the dependencies of each Operation.NOTE: this is currently false. Attribution-----------`paws` was written at SSRL by Chris Tassone's research group.If you use `paws` in your published research, a citation would be appreciated.Before citing `paws`, it is of primary importance that you cite the authors of the original work that produced your results: this is almost certainly separate from the authors of `paws`.Citations for your specific Operations should be foundin the `paws` documentation.If you have trouble finding proper citations,please contact us at `paws-developers@slac.stanford.edu`,and we will do our best to help.Contribution------------Contribution to `paws` is encouraged and appreciated.Get in touch with the `paws` development teamat `paws-developers@slac.stanford.edu`.If you are able to develop without assistance,feel free to submit a pull request against the `dev` branch athttps://github.com/slaclab/paws.License-------The 3-clause BSD-like license attached to this software can be found in the LICENSE file in the source code root directory.</longdescription>

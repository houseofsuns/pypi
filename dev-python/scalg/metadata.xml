	<longdescription># Scoring Algorithm (SCALG)This algorithm works based on a percentual range proximity principle. Initially it was developed for a personal project, however later I found out it is a form of Newton's method used in statistics to solve maximum likelihood equations.## Usage    pip install scalgAs of __15 september 2020__ it contains two methods (`score` and `score_columns`) which will be described and demonstrated in the examples below.    import scalg## ExamplesThis will be the sample dataset used as source_data withing the examples with the corresponding indexes and column weights.    Columns -&gt;  0     1      2      3    Weights -&gt;  1     0      0      1            1[[2016 ,21999 ,62000  ,181],    Sets -&gt; 2 [2013 ,21540 ,89000  ,223],            3 [2015 ,18900 ,100000 ,223],            4 [2013 ,24200 ,115527 ,223],            5 [2016 ,24990 ,47300  ,223]]### Score MethodThe output if you pass in source_data and weights:`scalg.score(source_data, [1, 0, 0, 1])`    [[2016, 21999, 62000,  181, 2.2756757812463335],     [2013, 21540, 89000,  223, 1.9553074815952338],     [2015, 18900, 100000, 223, 2.894245191297678],     [2013, 24200, 115527, 223, 1.1297208538587848],     [2016, 24990, 47300,  223, 3.0]]The output if you pass in source_data, weights and get_scores=True:`scalg.score(source_data, [1, 0, 0, 1], get_scores=True)`    [2.2756757812463335, 1.9553074815952338, 2. 894245191297678, 1.1297208538587848, 3.0]The output if you pass in source_data, weights and get_score_lists=True:`scalg.score(source_data, [1, 0, 0, 1], get_score_lists=True)`    [[1.0                 ,0.0, 0.6666666666666666 ,0.0                      ,1.0]     [0.49113300492610834 ,0.5665024630541872      ,1.0, 0.12972085385878485 ,0.0]     [0.7845427763202251  ,0.38880501854104677     ,0.22757852463101114      ,0.0]     [0.0                 ,1.0                     ,1.0                      ,1.0]]This gives out the score of each element in the list compared to other elements, keeping it's position.### Score Columns MethodHere you may use the same weights which you would use in `scalg.score`, or you may specify the weights of each column in the corresponding order. In this example using the weights argument `[1, 0, 0, 1]` or `[0, 1]` would make no difference.The output if you pass in source_data, columns and weights:`scalg.score_columns(source_data, [0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1])`     Scored columns            Scores for corresponding columns       0|    1|                  |    [[2016 ,21999 ,62000  ,181 ,1.4911330049261085],     [2013 ,21540 ,89000  ,223 ,0.5665024630541872],     [2015 ,18900 ,100000 ,223 ,1.6666666666666665],     [2013 ,24200 ,115527 ,223 ,0.12972085385878485],     [2016 ,24990 ,47300  ,223 ,1.0]]The score was computed only based on columns 0 and 1.</longdescription>

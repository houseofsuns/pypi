	<longdescription># python-wait4it![Test](https://github.com/David-Lor/python-wait4it/workflows/Test/badge.svg)[![PyPi](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyPi-wait4it-blue)](https://pypi.org/project/wait4it/)[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/David-Lor/python-wait4it)](https://github.com/David-Lor/python-wait4it/blob/master/LICENSE.md)Wait-For-It Python module, that waits until a certain TCP port is available.Based on the idea behind the well-known [wait-for-it](https://github.com/vishnubob/wait-for-it) script, but created mainly as a Python package to be used on other Python applications, services or modules, instead of being mainly a CLI tool.## InstallingPackage is available at [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/wait4it), so you can install it with `pip install wait4it` - or from sources with `python setup.py install`.## Usage```pythonfrom wait4it import wait_for, WaitForTimeoutError# This should return instantly (if you have connection)wait_for(host=&quot;google.com&quot;, port=80)# This should fail in 5 secondstry:    wait_for(host=&quot;google.com&quot;, port=12345, timeout=5)except TimeoutError:    # Actually will raise custom WaitForTimeoutError exception, but inherits from TimeoutError (except on Python2)    print(&quot;Failed! (as expected)&quot;)# This should return False in 15 secondswait_for(host=&quot;google.com&quot;, port=12345, raise_error=False)# Normally you will want to check for a port in localhost (e.g. a MySQL/MariaDB database).# This can be done directly like:wait_for(3306)# The exceptions include the failing host/porttry:    wait_for(host=&quot;google.com&quot;, port=12345)except WaitForTimeoutError as ex:    assert ex.host == &quot;google.com&quot;    assert ex.port == 12345```### wait_for_pass decoratorIt works similarly to wait_for, but if the considered exceptions are raised on the decorated function, it will re-rununtil it runs without raising these errors, or until the given retries limit is reached.The following example will randomly raise ZeroDivisionError in the function `divide_by_random`, which runs 10 times.If fails more than twice, the exception will be thrown outside the function.```pythonfrom random import randintfrom wait4it import wait_for_pass@wait_for_pass(ZeroDivisionError, retries=2)def divide_by_random(n=10):    d = randint(0, 1)    print(&quot;Gonna divide&quot;, n, &quot;/&quot;, d)    return n / dfor _ in range(10):    r = divide_by_random()    print(&quot;Got result:&quot;, r)```If `retries` is set to 0, the function will run forever until it passes without raising exceptions.wait_for_pass also allows a parameter `retries_delay`, which can be used to define a delay, in seconds, between failed function executions.## Dependencies &amp; CompatibilityNot external dependencies are required. Compatible (tested with) Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 - under Linux.## Changelog- 0.2.1 - Add retries_delay parameter to wait_for_pass- 0.1.2 - Fix wait_for_pass decorator not looping indefinitely when retries=0- 0.1.1 - Add wait_for_pass decorator- 0.0.1 - Initial release## TODO- Set retries limit on wait_for- Set timeout on wait_for_pass</longdescription>

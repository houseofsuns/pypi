Well defined and consistent guidelines reduces errors and  unwanted side-effects. Framework should be easy to understand, implement and maintain.* **Secure:** Follow the industry best practices secure software development; communications;  storage as well as long term maintenance. Always evaluate the risk and trade-offs in  appropriate contexts.* **Clean code:** Strictly follow DRY principle; write your code for other developers  to understand; document and keep documentation updated; automate testing your code,  packaging, deployments and other processes; discuss your ideas before implementing unless  you are absolutely sure; be a good craftsmen.* **Open:** Offer source code and related artifacts under open source licenses. Build  and manage a collaborative community where everyone is welcome.* **Configurable:** Provide ways to change behavior, appearance and offer extension points  everywhere possible.* **Reuse:** Do not reinvent the wheel. Use existing high-quality modules as much as possible.## Endpoints* `devices/`* `action-categories/`## Data model...## Views and templates...## Development### Running test application.Here you can check admin and API endpoints.```python3 -m venv venv. venv/bin/activatepip install -e .[test]./manage.py runserver```### Running tests```# Without coverage reportmake test# With coverage reportmake test-cov```### Deploying new versionChange version in `setup.cfg` and push new tag to main branch.```git tag 0.0.xgit push --tags```## Other modules and links out there...## Sponsors[Apexive OSS](https://apexive.com)</longdescription>

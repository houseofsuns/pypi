	<longdescription> Reahl is a web application framework that allows a Python programmer to work in  terms of useful abstractions - using a single programming language. Tofu is part of the Reahl development tools. Tofu can be used independently of the Reahl web framework. Tofu allows you to have a hierarchy of test fixtures that is *completely* decoupled from your hierarchy of tests or test suites. Tofu includes a number of other related test utilities. It also includes a plugin for nosetests that makes using it with nose seamless. Tofu can also be used to run the set_ups of fixtures from the command  line.  This is useful for acceptance tests whose fixtures create data in databases that can be used for demonstration and user testing.</longdescription>

However, doing these calculations manually can be cumbersome and error-prone. This is where Python, with its vast library support and simplicity, can be a lifesaver.In this article, we'll delve into a Python class called I have created called the 'NetworkCalculator'. It is designed to automate common network calculation tasks. To fully understand this, it is recommended you have some basic knowledge of IP addresses, subnet masks, network IDs, broadcast IDs, and CIDR notation. There are a tone of online resources to help your understanding. The NetworkCalculator class is initialized with an IP address in CIDR notation as input. CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation represents an IP address and its associated routing prefix. For instance, '192.168.1.10/24' is an example of an IP address in CIDR notation.The __init__ method splits the IP address and the CIDR subnet prefix, and an IPv4Network object is created with these. The strict=False parameter allows the IP address part to be any IP address inside the network.### Network Calculator Methods you can use in your code ```After creating the NetworkCalculator object, Here are several methods can we create and us to perform network calculations:get_subnet_mask(): Returns the subnet mask of the network. The subnet mask defines the size of the network.get_network_id(): Returns the Network ID. This is the first IP address in the network and it identifies the network itself.get_next_network(): Returns the Network ID of the next network. It's calculated by adding 2^(32 - CIDR) to the network address.get_broadcast_id(): Returns the last IP address in the network, which is used for broadcasting messages to all devices in the network.get_first_ip(): Returns the first usable IP address in the network. It's simply the Network ID plus one.get_last_ip(): Returns the last usable IP address in the network, which is one less than the broadcast ID.get_total_ips(): Returns the total number of usable IP addresses in the network.```## Installation```pythonpip install networkcalculator```### how to use the code ```python from cidr.network_calculator  import Network_Calculator# Use it like this:ip_list = ['198.51.100.0/22 ', '192.168.1.10/26', '172.16.0.5/16']# Call the function with the list of CIDR IP addressesNetwork_Calculator.print_network_info(ip_list)# Call the function with the list of CIDR IP addresses and the filename of your output fileNetwork_Calculator.write_to_csv(ip_list, 'network.csv')```### Output | CIDR            | Subnet Mask     | Network ID   | Next Network | Broadcast ID   | First IP     | Last IP        | Total IPs || --------------- | --------------- | ------------ | ------------ | -------------- | ------------ | -------------- | --------- || 198.51.100.0/22 | 255.255.252.0   | 198.51.100.0 | 198.51.104.0 | 198.51.103.255 | 198.51.100.1 | 198.51.103.254 | 1022      || 192.168.1.10/26 | 255.255.255.192 | 192.168.1.0  | 192.168.1.64 | 192.168.1.63   | 192.168.1.1  | 192.168.1.62   | 62        || 172.16.0.5/16   | 255.255.0.0     | 172.16.0.0   | 172.17.0.0   | 172.16.255.255 | 172.16.0.1   | 172.16.255.254 | 65534     ||                 |                 |              |              |                |              |                |           |### Bandwidth Calculator  In an era where data is being transferred in vast amounts and at high speeds, understanding bandwidth needs and capacity is an essential aspect of network management and application performance. A Bandwidth Calculator is a tool that helps you estimate the bandwidth needed to move a specific amount of data within a specific timeframe. In this article, we will delve into a Python code that creates a Bandwidth Calculator, designed to help you predict your bandwidth needs accurately.The Bandwidth Calculator we are focusing on takes in four parameters: the throughput, the read percentage, the write percentage, and the initial data size. The Bandwidth Calculator is instantiated from the Bandwidth_Calculator class from the feeds.bandwidth_calculator module```pythonfrom feeds.bandwidth_calculator import Bandwidth_Calculator# Create a BandwidthCalculator objectbc = Bandwidth_Calculator('1 Gbps', 50, 50, '1 TB') # Throughput , reads %, writes /%, Initial data size # Write the results to a CSV filebc.write_to_csv('feeds.csv')```### Output | Media Throughput | Read/Write Ratio | Initial Data Size | Disk Space Required (Read) | Disk Space Required (Write) | Bandwidth Required (Read) | Bandwidth Required (Write) | Transfer Time                           || ---------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- || 1.0 Gbps         | 50:50            | 1.0 TB            | 62.5 MBps                  | 62.5 MBps                   | 500.0 Mbps                | 500.0 Mbps                 | 2 hours 13 minutes 20.0 seconds seconds ||                  |                  |                   |                            |                             |                           |                            |                                         |### About: Ray Bernard is a seasoned technologist specializing in cloud-based platforms, data science, and AI.

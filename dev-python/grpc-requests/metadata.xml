If the server utilizes SSL (and it probably does)make sure to toggle that flag.```pythonfrom grpc_requests import Clientmetadata = [{&quot;authorization&quot;:&quot;bearer my.cool.jwt&quot;}]client = Client.get_by_endpoint(&quot;cool.servers.arecool:443&quot;, ssl=True, metadata=metadata)```The [examples page](./src/examples/README.md) provides more thorough examples ofusage scenarioes, and the [unit tests](./src/tests/) are also a useful reference point.## ContributingContributions from the community are welcomed and greatly appreciated.Before opening a PR, [tests.sh](./tests.sh) can be used to ensure the contribution passeslinting and unit test checks.PRs should be targeted to merge with the `develop` branch.

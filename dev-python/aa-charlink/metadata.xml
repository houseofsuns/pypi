A link will appear on top of the main page of the app and will redirect to a page with a table of all the linked characters of the users of the selected corporation.A user can be audited by clicking on the link on the `Main Character` column.NEW: Users can now audit the apps they have access to.

Add `'charlink',` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` in `local.py`3. Run migrations## Current appsI've opened an [issue](https://github.com/Maestro-Zacht/aa-charlink/issues/1) to track the current apps that are implemented in CharLink and the WIPs. If you want another app to be supported, please comment on the issue or reach me on the [AllianceAuth discord server](https://discord.gg/fjnHAmk).## Settings| Name                   | Description                                                                         | Default || ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- || `CHARLINK_IGNORE_APPS` | List of apps to ignore.

	<longdescription># Memfault CLI toolThis package contains the `memfault` CLI tool.The purpose of the tool is to make integration with Memfault from other systems,like continuous integration servers, as easy as possible.Install the tool and run `memfault --help` for more info!## Changes### 1.0.4- Add `upload-elf-symbols` command for uploading ELF files with debug symbols  built outside of a Yocto environment- Add `upload-elf-coredump` for uploading a Linux coredump to Memfault### 1.0.3- Fix a bug where `upload-aosp-symbols` would fail when uploading too many files  at once.### 1.0.2- Fix a bug where `upload-yocto-symbols` would fail when some files in the  tarballs provided did not have the read permission set.### 1.0.1- Fix `upload-custom-data-recording` to print a more helpful error message when  exceeding device rate limits.### 1.0.0_Note: this release is marked as `1.0.0` but does not contain any breakingchanges! The version number was bumped to reflect the maturity of the tool._- Fix `upload-mcu-symbols` to skip uploading if the symbol file has already been  uploaded, and return a zero exit code in this case### 0.18.1- Add the `--deactivate` option to `deploy-release`, which disables a release  for a cohort### 0.18.0- Add new `extra-metadata` option to `upload-ota-payload` to attach custom  metadata to that OTA release. The metadata will be returned from Memfault  Cloud when fetching the latest Android OTA release.- Continue uploading the entire folder of symbols even if any single upload  fails due to the symbol file being too large.### 0.17.0- Add new `console` command to read SDK exported chunks via a serial port and  automatically upload to Memfault.### 0.16.0- Add support for uploading Android debug symbols from alternative build  systems.### 0.15.3- Warn if a non-slug string is passed to the `--project` or `--org` arguments### 0.15.2- Don't truncate help output from `click` when the `CI` environment variable is  set, for consistent output formatting### 0.15.1- Fix some compatibility issues for python3.6 + python3.7### 0.15.0- 💥 Breaking change: update the `upload-yocto-symbols` subcommand to take two  image paths as required arguments; one for the root filesystem image, and  another for the debug filesystem image. Versions 0.14.0 and lower used to take  a guess at the path of the debug filesystem image from the value passed to the  `--image` param. To avoid confusion and to support all configurations, the  Memfault CLI no longer does any guessing and now takes two separate params:  `--image` and `--dbg-image`### 0.14.0- ✨ Update the `post-chunk` subcommand to split uploads into batches of 500  chunks per upload, to avoid timing out when uploading very large chunk logs### 0.13.0- 💥 Breaking change: Renamed subcommand `upload-debug-data-recording` to  `custom-data-recording`### 0.12.0- ✨ Added subcommand `upload-debug-data-recording` for uploading debug data  files### 0.11.0- ✨ Enable support for Yocto Dunfell based projects (previously supported  Kirkstone only)### 0.10.0- ✨ Upload-yocto-symbols now uploads additional symbol files### 0.9.0- ✨ Expanded support for .elf uploading with the upload-yocto-symbols  subcommand### 0.8.0- ✨ Initial support for upload-yocto-symbols subcommand### 0.7.0- 🐛 Updated to correctly only use the GNU build-id `.note` section</longdescription>

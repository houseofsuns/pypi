(2013)&lt;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.432.1862C&gt;`_ of thealgorithm by `Cleveland (1979) &lt;https://doi.org/10.2307/2286407&gt;`_.Calling Sequence----------------.. code-block:: python    xout, yout, wout = loess_1d(x, y, xnew=None, degree=1, frac=0.5,                                npoints=None, rotate=False, sigy=None)Input Parameters----------------x: array_like with shape (n,)    Vector of ``x`` coordinate.y: array_like with shape (n,)    Vector of ``y`` coordinate to be LOESS smoothed.Optional Keywords-----------------xnew: array_like with shape (m,), optional    Vector of coordinates at which to compute the smoothed ``y`` values.degree: {1, 2}, optional    degree of the local 1-dim polynomial approximation (default ``degree=1``).frac: float, optional    Fraction of points to consider in the local approximation (default ``frac=0.5``).    Typical values are between ``frac~0.2-0.8``. Note that the values are    weighted by a Gaussian function of their distance from the point under     consideration. This implies that the effective fraction of points     contributing to a given value is much smaller that ``frac``.npoints: int, optional    Number of points to consider in the local approximation.    This is an alternative to using ``frac=npoints/x.size``.rotate: bool, optional    Rotate the ``(x, y)`` coordinates to have the maximum variance along the    ``x`` axis. This is useful to give comparable contribution to the    errors in the ``x`` and ``y`` variables. It can be used to asses the    sensitivity of the solution to the assumption that errors are only in ``y``.sigy: array_like with shape (n,)    1-sigma errors for the ``y`` values. If this keyword is used    the biweight fit is done assuming those errors. If this keyword    is *not* used, the biweight fit determines the errors in ``y``    from the scatter of the neighbouring points.Output Parameters-----------------xout: array_like with shape (n,)    Vector of ``x`` coordinates for the ``yout`` values.    If ``rotate=False`` (default) then ``xout=x``.        When passing as input the ``xnew`` coordinates then ``xout=xnew``    and both have shape ``(m,)``.yout: array_like with shape (n,)    Vector of smoothed ``y`` values at the coordinates ``xout``.        When passing as input the ``xnew`` coordinates this contains the    smoothed values at the coordinates ``xnew`` and has shape ``(m,)``.wout: array_like with shape (n,)    Vector of biweights used in the local regressions. This can be used to    identify outliers: ``wout=0`` for outliers with deviations ``&gt;4sigma``.        When passing as input the ``xnew`` coordinates, this output is    meaningless and is arbitrarily set to unity.###########################################################################loess_2d========Purpose-------Two-dimensional LOESS smoothing via robust locally-weighted regression.This function is the implementation by `Cappellari et al. (2013)&lt;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.432.1862C&gt;`_ of thealgorithm by `Cleveland (1979) &lt;https://doi.org/10.2307/2286407&gt;`_for the one-dimensional case and `Cleveland &amp; Devlin (1988)&lt;https://doi.org/10.2307/2289282&gt;`_ for the two-dimensional case.Calling Sequence----------------.. code-block:: python   zout, wout = loess_2d(x, y, z, xnew=None, ynew=None, degree=1, frac=0.5,                         npoints=None, rescale=False, sigz=None)Input Parameters----------------x: array_like with shape (n,)    vector of ``x`` coordinates.y: array_like with shape (n,)    vector of ``y`` coordinates.z: array_like with shape (n,)    vector of ``z`` coordinates to be LOESS smoothed.Optional Keywords-----------------xnew: array_like with shape (m,), optional    Vector with the ``x`` coordinates at which to compute the smoothed    ``z`` values.ynew: array_like with shape (m,), optional    Vector with the ``y`` coordinates at which to compute the smoothed    ``z`` values.degree: {1, 2}, optional    degree of the local 2-dim polynomial approximation (default ``degree=1``).frac: float, optional    Fraction of points to consider in the local approximation (default ``frac=0.5``).    Typical values are between ``frac~0.2-0.8``. Note that the values are    weighted by a Gaussian function of their distance from the point under    consideration. This implies that the effective fraction of points    contributing to a given value is much smaller that ``frac``.npoints: int, optional    Number of points to consider in the local approximation.    This is an alternative to using ``frac=npoints/x.size``.rescale: bool, optional    Rotate the ``(x, y)`` coordinates to make the ``x`` axis the axis of    maximum variance. Subsequently scale the coordinates to have equal    variance along both axes. Then perform the local regressions.    This is recommended when the distribution of points is elongated or    when the units are very different for the two axes.sigz: array_like with shape (n,)    1-sigma errors for the ``z`` values. If this keyword is used    the biweight fit is done assuming these errors. If this keyword    is *not* used, the biweight fit determines the errors in ``z``    from the scatter of the neighbouring points.Output Parameters-----------------zout: array_like with shape (n,)    Vector of smoothed ``z`` values at the coordinates ``(x, y)``, or at    ``(xnew, ynew)`` if the latter are given as input. In the latter case    ``zout`` has shape ``(m,)``.wout: array_like with shape (n,)    Vector of biweights used in the local regressions. This can be used to    identify outliers: ``wout=0`` for outliers with deviations ``&gt;4sigma``.    When passing as input the ``(xnew, ynew)`` coordinates, this output is    meaningless and is arbitrarily set to unity.###########################################################################License=======Other/Proprietary LicenseCopyright (c) 2010-2022 Michele CappellariThis software is provided as is without any warranty whatsoever.Permission to use, for non-commercial purposes is granted.Permission to modify for personal or internal use is granted,provided this copyright and disclaimer are included in all copies of the software.

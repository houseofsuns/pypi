	<longdescription>\n# biomage-programmatic-interface### AboutThis python package provides an easy way to create projects and upload samples into Biomage.## InstallationTo install the package execute the following line:`pip install biomage-programmatic-interface`## UsageIn order to use the package you first need to create an account in Biomage (https://scp.biomage.net/) if you don't have one yet.Then the package is used in the following way:```pythonimport biomage_programmatic_interface as bpi# 1. Authenticate user and create a connection tunnel with the api# Default instance-url: https://api.scp.biomage.net/connection = bpi.Connection('email', 'password', 'instance_url')# 2. Create an experimentexperiment = connection.create_experiment('experiment name')# 3. Upload samples associated with the experimentexperiment.upload_samples('local/path/to/samples')```Once the upload is complete you can navigate to [Biomage](https://scp.biomage.net/) and process your project there.### `Connection` classThe object accepts 3 parameters:1. `email` - Biomage email2. `password` - Biomage password3. `instance_url` - Biomage instance url- Copy the url of the Biomage instance *excluding* `https://`- If the url is https://scp.biomage.net/ enter just the domain name: `scp.biomage.net`## DevelopmentIf you cloned the repository and want to try using your local version, do the following:- Install the local version of the pip package:```bashcd programmatic_interfacemake install```- Now you can import the package and use your local version```pythonimport biomage_programmatic_interface as bpi```***NOTE***: There is **NO** need to run `make install` every time you make changes to the package. When the local changes have been saved the changes will be automatically reflected.### Running with local instance of CellenicsWhen creating the `connection` object set the `instance_url` to `local`. Now the programmatic interface will use your local api (https://localhost:3000)```pythonimport biomage_programmatic_interface as bpiconn = bpi.Connection(&lt;YOUR EMAIL&gt;, &lt;YOUR PASSWORD&gt;, 'local')...```### Running with staged environmentSet the full path of the instance url (e.g. `https://api-{ENVIRONMENT NAME}.scp-staging.biomage.net/`) ```pythonimport biomage_programmatic_interface as bpiconn = bpi.Connection(&lt;YOUR EMAIL&gt;, &lt;YOUR PASSWORD&gt;, 'https://api-{ENVIRONMENT NAME}.scp-staging.biomage.net/')...```*NOTE: the url is that of the api (i.e. `api-`) and not that of the ui* </longdescription>

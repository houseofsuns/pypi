	<longdescription># Brutal MazeBrutal Maze is a thrilling shoot 'em up game with minimalist art style.![Screenshot](https://brutalmaze.rtfd.io/_images/screenshot.png)The game features a trigon trapped in an infinite maze.  As our hero triesto escape, the maze's border turns into aggressive squares trying to stop per.Your job is to help the trigon fight against those evil squares and finda way out (if there is any).  Be aware that the more get killed,the more will show up and our hero will get weaker when wounded.Brutal Maze has a few notable features:* Being highly portable.* Auto-generated and infinite maze.* No binary data for drawing.* Enemies with special abilities: stun, poison, camo, etc.* Somewhat a realistic physic and logic system.* Resizable game window in-game.* Easily customizable via INI file format.* Recordable in JSON (some kind of silent screencast).* Remote control through TCP/IP socket (can be used in AI researching).## InstallationBrutal Maze is written in Python and is compatible version 3.7 and above.The installation procedure should be as simple as follows:* Install Python and [pip].  Make sure the directory for [Python scripts]  is in your `$PATH`.* Open Terminal or Command Prompt and run `pip install --user brutalmaze`.For more information, see [Installation] page in the documentation.After installation, you can launch the game by running the command`brutalmaze`.  Below are the default bindings, which can be configured asshown in the next section:* `F2`: new game* `p`: toggle pause* `m`: toggle mute* `a`: move left* `d`: move right* `w`: move up* `s`: move down* Left mouse: long-range attack* Right mouse: close-range attack, also dodge from bulletsAdditionally, Brutal Maze also supports touch-friendly control.  In this mode,touches on different grid (empty, wall, enemy, hero) send different signals(to guide the hero to either move or attack, or start new game).  Albeit it isimplemented using *mouse button up* event, touch control is not a solution formouse-only input, but an attempt to support mobile GNU/Linux distribution suchas postmarketOS, i.e. it's meant to be played using two thumbs :-)## ConfigurationBrutal Maze supports both configuration file and command-line options.Apparently, while settings for graphics, sound and socket server can be seteither in the config file or using CLI, keyboard and mouse bindings are limitedto configuration file only.Settings are read in the following order:0. Default configuration (this can be copied to desired location   by `brutalmaze --write-config PATH`.  `brutalmaze --write-config` alone   will print the file to stdout)1. System-wide and local configuration file (these will be listed   as fallback config in `brutalmaze --help`; see the [Configuration]   documentation for more info)2. Manually specified configuration file (via `brutalmaze --config PATH`)3. Command-line argumentsLater-read preferences will override previous ones.## Remote controlIf you enable the socket server, Brutal Maze will no longer acceptdirect input from your mouse or keyboard, but wait for a client to connect.This can be done by either editing option *Enable* in section *Server*in the configuration file or launching the game via `brutalmaze --server`.The I/O format is explained in details in the [Remote Control] page.## Game recordingEither game played by human or client script can be recorded to JSON format.This can be enabled by setting the output directory to a non-empty string:`brutalmaze --record-dir DIR`.  Navigate to [Configuration] for more options.Recordings can be played using Brutal Maze [HTML5 record player].## CopyingBrutal Maze's source code and its icon are released under GNU Affero GeneralPublic License version 3 or later. This means if you run a modified program ona server and let other users communicate with it there, your server must alsoallow them to download the source code corresponding to the modified versionrunning there.This project also uses Tango color palette and several sound effects, whoseauthors and licenses are listed in the [Copying] page in our documentation.[pip]: https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/[Python scripts]: https://docs.python.org/3/install/index.html#alternate-installation-the-user-scheme[Installation]: https://brutalmaze.rtfd.io/install.html[Remote Control]: https://brutalmaze.rtfd.io/remote.html[HTML5 record player]: https://brutalmaze.rtfd.io/recplayer.html[Copying]: https://brutalmaze.rtfd.io/copying.html[Configuration]: https://brutalmaze.rtfd.io/config.html</longdescription>

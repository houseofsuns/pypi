	<longdescription>.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/xlcnd/datafolder.svg?branch=v0.3.6    :target: https://travis-ci.org/xlcnd/datafolder    :alt: Built Status``datafolder`` is a small python library that makes it very easy to **install**the `data files` of your package and **access** them later.If you want to install some data files (conf, sqlite, csv, ...) to a place likethe user's home directory and find it difficult with ``setuptools``, then hereis some help.   **WARNING** this is beta software!First, let's make life easier and use some 'configuration by convention'.I assume that (1) you have layout your project like::    MANIFEST.in    README.rst    setup.py    mypkg        │        ├── __init__.py        ├── mypkg.conf        ├── mypkg.db        └── ...And that (2) you want to put a folder, in the home directory of the user(in Windows will be in %APPDATA%), with your data files (conf, csv, ...) inside.This folder will have the name of your package (preceded with a '.' in UNIXsystems), let's say '.mypkg' and, of course, with the right permissions(it will work with ``sudo pip install mypkg``). For virtual environements thedata folder will be put at the root of the environement.**How to do it?**(1) First, install the ``datafolder`` package::    $ pip install -U datafolder(2) Then, type::    $ datafolder    It will make a file called ``bootdf.py`` that you **must** put inside your ``mypkg`` directory and     a new file called ``setup_TPL.py`` that you **must** put in the root of your project.(3) ``setup_TPL.py`` is a template that you have to adapt to your case:.. code-block:: python    import sys    import pkg_resources    from setuptools import setup    from mypkg.bootdf import Installer                         # &lt;-- ADAPT THIS    # write the name of the package (in this case 'mypkg'!)    MYPKG = 'mypkg'                                            # &lt;-- ADAPT THIS    # list of data files in mypkg (just the names)    # [don't forget to include these files in MANIFEST.in!]    MYDATAFILES = ['mypkg.conf', 'mypkg.db']                   # &lt;-- ADAPT THIS    # tell setup were these files are in your package    # (I assume that they are together with the first __init__.py)    MYRESOURCES = [pkg_resources.resource_filename(MYPKG, datafile)                   for datafile in MYDATAFILES]    # now, create the installer    installer = Installer(sys.argv)    # create the data folder and tell setup to put the data files there    DATAPATH = installer.data_path(MYPKG)    data_files = [(DATAPATH, MYRESOURCES)]    # now, setup can do his thing...    setup(        name=MYPKG,        packages=[MYPKG,'other_packg1','other_packg2'],        # &lt;-- ADAPT THIS        data_files=data_files,        ...                                                    # &lt;-- ADAPT THIS    )    # but we are NOT READY, in some cases the data files    # don't have the appropriate permissions,    # let us fix that...    installer.pos_setup(MYDATAFILES)(4) Now, **rename** the file to **setup.py**.(5) Write your **MANIFEST.in** file (**missing this step is the cause of many problems!**). Should look like this:.. code-block:: console    include *.txt    include *.md    include *.rst    include mypkg/*.conf    include mypkg/*.rst    include mypkg/*.db**And that is all!**    But **with version 0.2.1** it is **even better**!(1) Just **go to the root of you project** and in a terminal type::    $ datafolder mypkg(2) Now, you will see that ``MANIFEST.in`` and ``setup.py`` were fill in for you and    ``bootdf.py`` is already inside the ``mypkg`` folder. **You only need to complete** ``setup.py``    **as need** (the fields ``author``, ``email``, ``url`` and trove classifiers ...).&quot;But, **I have the reverse problem**, how can I access these files in my code?&quot;I heard you say.Very easy, in your code (for a file in the same folder as ``bootdf.py``):.. code-block:: python    from .bootdf import DataFolder    data = DataFolder('mypkg')    # now you can get the full path of each data file, e.g.    conf_fp = data.files['mypkg.conf']    # do your thing... (read, write, ...)For your convinience, the ``DataFolder`` class *discovers* the locationof the data folder for you and provides attributes and methods,that make it easy to handle the files presente in the data folder.Feedback_, please!   **REMARK**: as you can see above, this only works if the   install method uses ``setup.py``. Is **not** the case   of *python wheels* however!.. _Feedback: https://github.com/xlcnd/datafolder/issues</longdescription>

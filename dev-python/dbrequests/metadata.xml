It aims to reproduce the pilosophy behind the R-package [dbtools](https://github.com/INWT/dbtools/)._Database support includes RedShift, Postgres, MySQL, SQLite, Oracle, and MS-SQL (drivers not included)._## Usage### Send queries and bulk queriesEasy sending of raw sql and output as pandas DataFrames, with credentials given as dictionary (for an example see creds_example.json) or the url of the database:```pythonfrom dbrequests import Databasedb = Database(creds=creds)df = db.send_query(&quot;&quot;&quot;    SELECT * FROM test;    &quot;&quot;&quot;)df # table test as pandas DataFrame```You can put the sql query in a file and direct `send_query` to the file. The sql-file may be parametrized:```sqlSELECT {col1}, {col2} FROM test;``````pythonfrom dbrequests import Databasedb = Database(creds=creds, sql_dir = '/path/to/dir/')db.send_query('select', col1='id', col2='name')df # table test, including columns 'id', 'name' as pandas DataFrame```You can also pass arguments to pandas `read_sql`-Function:```pythonfrom dbrequests import Databasedb = Database(creds=creds, sql_dir = '/path/to/dir/')db.send_query('select', col1='id', col2='name', index_col='id')df # table test, including column 'name' as pandas DataFrame with index 'id'```You may also send queries with no table as output to the database via `send_bulk_query`, which exhibits the same behavior as `send_query`:```pythondb.send_bulk_query('drop test from test;')```### Send dataEasy sending of pandas Dataframes in multiple modes:```pythondb.send_data(df, 'table', mode='insert')```Supported modes are:  - 'insert': Appending new records. Duplicate primary keys will result in errors (sql insert into).  - 'truncate': Delete the table and completely rewrite it (sql truncate and insert into).  - 'replace': Replace records with duplicate primary keys (sql replace into).  - 'update': Update records with duplicate primary keys (sql insert into duplicate key update).### Utilities- Comments can be automatically removed from SQL code by adding `remove_comments=True` either to the Database defintion or send_query. This is especially useful if outcommenting code blocks including parametized variables and thus `{}`. The default of this behavior is `False`.- Percentage signs can be transfered to a Python readable way by adding `escape_percentage=True` either to the Database definition or send_query. This means percentage signs dont have to be escaped manually when sending them via Python. The default is `False`.- Database.get_table_names will give existing tables in the database- Parameters such es `chunksize` for `pandas.to_sql` may be given to the wrapper function `send_data` and are handed over to pandas. The same is true for `send_query`.- For transactions the context manager `transaction` may be of use.## InstallationThe package can be installed via pip:```pip install dbrequests```## Extensibilitydbrequests is designed to easily accommodate different needs in the form of drivers / dialects. For examples of how to extend the capabilities of the Connection class, see connection_subclass.py under examples.### Existing extensions- MySQL / MariaDB: use```from dbrequests.mysql import Database```for using the MySQL specific extension as Database connector. The extension provides MySQL specific functionalities, like using `load data infile` for writing data to tables.## Version 1.0  - implemented send_data and send_query wrappers for pandas sql-functionality## Version 1.0.8  - renamed to dbrequests## Version 1.1  - added handling of percentage signs  - added possibility of automated comment removal  - ensured the compatibility of raw SQL code with code sent via dbrequests## Version 1.2  -  changed static loading of the connection class to a flexible model, allowing to override connections for different SQL drivers## Version 1.3  - added mysql backend for specific mysql and mariadb support  - added possibility for send_data to use infile for mysql databases## Version 1.3.8  - dbrequests.mysql module:    - see #11 for motivation on moving dialect specific implementation into extras    - see #15 for mysql specific send_data via load data local infile## Version 1.3.9  - dbrequests.mysql:    - see #20 for memory efficient send_data using datatable## Version 1.3.10  - dbrequests.mysql:    - see #24 for bugfix while writing to csv## Version 1.3.11  - dbrequests.mysql:    - see #28 for bugfix when sending escape sequences## Version 1.3.12  - dbrequests.mysql:    - see #22 for performance improvements for send_query when reading large datasets    - support for pymysql and mysqldb## Version 1.3.13  - dbrequests.mysql    - see #30: fixes handling of None/NULL values in columns## Version 1.3.14  - dbrequests.mysql:    - see #32 for bugfix in send_query for empty result sets## Version 1.3.15  - dbrequests:    - see #27 for bugfix in Database class when specifiying a port in a      credentials object.    - the argument 'creds' in the init method of a database class is now      deprecated    - the argument 'db_url' can now handle str and dict type; str is a      sqlalchemy url; a dict a credentials object    - credential objects can now have additional fields which will be used as      elements in connect_args for sqlalchemies create_engine: see #12  - dbrequests.mysql    - see #36 for bugfix while sending an empty frame## Version 1.3.16  - dbrequests.mysql    - see #35: New send_data modes: update_diffs, insert_diffs, replace_diffs## Version 1.3.17  - dbrequests.mysql    - new function in database: send_delete for deleting rows in a database.    - send_data in mode 'update' now allows to send only partial subset of      columns.## Version 1.4.0  - dbrequests.mysql    - bugfix in send_data with mode [update|insert|replace]_diffs: same as #36## Version 1.4.1  - dbrequests.mysql    - bugfix for upstream bug in mariadb: sending diffs needs persisten tables      instead of temporary.## Version 1.4.2  - dbrequests.mysql    - creating temorary removing partitions and system versioned from temporary      tables.    - new mode for send data: sync_diffs: update differences and delete      deprecated rows.    - new mode for delete data: in_delete_col: mark rows to delete, then delete.    - bugfix for temporary tables: now properly removes tables.## Version 1.4.3-5  - dbrequests.mysql    - More stable and reliable Version of sync_diffs mode for sending data.

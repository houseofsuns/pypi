	<longdescription># HREELS data handling and simulationSet of data analysis routines for surface vibrational spectroscopy based on a Delta05 spectrometer. Simple data reading and plotting routines are provided, but also advanced routines for in depth analysis.A fast data browser as graphical user interface is included as **ViewHREELS.py**. It can also take command line arguments.Additional a python interface to a Fortran-based calculation of full HREEL spectra is provided in **class lambin** (in **calcHREELS.py**). Note that this part requires a local compilation (via f2py3) from the Fortran90 files. Only for the Linux-based python version 3.6, there are complied files provided. For details see below.Most of the routines are within the **class HREELS** (HREELS.py). A simple command line program is &quot;showHREELS.py&quot;, which reads one data file and plots the spectrum with a second amplified trace.    Usage:  &gt;python showHREELS.py filename [factor wavenumber]        E.g.: python showHREELS.py H9H03 100 53 More general usage:Read dataset by calling the HREELS class:    **data1 = HREELS('filename', datapath='datapath')**        # Here you can omit the extension '.gph'                                                    # The second argument is optional                                                        This will assign/calculate the following properties:        data1.filename    data1.datapath    data1.startTime    data1.stopTime    data1.totalTime    data1.timePerChannel    data1.numberOfSegments    data1.energy    # Electron kinetic energy    data1.filament  # Filament current in Ampere    data1.segments  # list of segment info    data1.data      # [(-100.1021616, 259.5), (-98.5374352, 264.5), ...]    data1.xdata    data1.ydata    data1.maxIntensity  # Count rate of elastic peak    data1.resolution    # width of elastic peakThe following methods are defined within the class:    info()      :   Print information about the spectrum    plot()      :   Draws the spectrum. Optional arguments are:                    (xmin=None, xmax=None, factor=1, label='x', normalized=False, color=&quot;b-&quot;,marker=True)    plotInfoAmp()   Draws spectrum together with amplified trace.    pickPeak()  :   Select peak by mouse cursor. The call of figure() is required before.    selectData():   Returns the data between wavenumbers x1 and x2    findIndex(lossenergy): Returns the data array index for a given energy loss    setMarker(x, y, ymin=0, size=None): Sets vertical marker with text label     plotWaterFall(...):        # calcHREELSThese routines are based on the publication &quot;Computation of the surface electron-energy-loss spectrum in specular geometry for an arbitrary plane-stratified medium&quot; by P. Lambin, J.-P. Vigneron, and A. A. Lucas, in the Journal &quot;Computer Physics Communications 60, 351-64(1990)&quot;.</longdescription>

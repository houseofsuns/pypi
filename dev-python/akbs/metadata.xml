	<longdescription># AKBS: The **A**ll **K**nowing **B**uild **S**ystem for C, C++ and Assembly## RequirementsPython 3&gt;=## Installation```bash# Linuxpython3 -m pip install akbs# Windows (UNSUPPORTED!)python -m pip install akbs# Usagepython3 -m akbs```## SpeedTo test the build system, I made a build script for [basic_math_operations](https://github.com/avighnac/basic_math_operations),**Operating System**: Debian Bullseye**Host**: Linux 5.10.102.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2**Architecture**: x86_64**AKBS**: Version: 1.0.5Time: 1.351s**CMake w/ Makefile**:CMake Version: 3.26.0Make Version: 4.3Time: 3.360s**CMake w/ Ninja**:CMake Version: 3.26.0Ninja Version: 1.11.1Time: 2.750sThe `build.akbs` file is as follows```set(C_STD, 17)set(CXX_STD, 17)set(FILES, wildcard$(src/library/**/*.cpp) wildcard$(src/library/**/*.c))set(OUTPUT_DIR, dist)set(BUILD_DIR, build)if(eq$($PLATFORM, POSIX))set(FILES, wildcard$(src/library/linux/*.asm) remove$($FILES, src/library/cross-platform/addp.c, src/library/cross-platform/multiply_whole.c))endifcheck_for(C, CXX, ASM_INTEL, SHARED, STATIC)set(OUTPUT, libbasic_math_operations.so)compile(SHARED, $FILES)set(OUTPUT, libbasic_math_operations.a)compile(STATIC, $FILES)```**Note:** The `remove$()` helper function is used because the `multiply_whole` and `addp` functions are already present in Assembly for Linux, not for Windows## How do you use AKBS?By default, the build script is called `build.akbs`, similar to `Makefile` and `CMakeLists.txt`However, you can use the `--file` option to specify a fileTo enable languages, you use the `check_for` function```check_for(C, CXX, ASM_INTEL, ASM_ATT, STATIC, SHARED)```Right now, only these 4 languages (and a static and shared library linker) (3 if you count AT&amp;T and Intel syntax Assembly as one language) are supportedIf you want to set the standard of C and C++, set the C_STD or CXX_STD variable```set(C_STD, 17)set(CXX_STD, 17)```To compile a list of files, use the compile function```compile(SHARED/STATIC, src/a.c src/b.c src/c.c)```To print a statement you can use the print function and to exit a program, use exit```print($PLATFORM)exit(1)```To use a variable, use `$VARIABLENAME`The `$PLATFORM` variable comes predefined and is set to `os.name`For conditions, use if (else and else if are not implemented yet) and endif.```if(set$(PLATFORM))print($PLATFORM)if(eq$($PLATFORM, UNIX))print Yay, we're in UNIX landendifendif```Also, there is a rudimentary pre-processor, with `%define````%define ifend endifif(set$(PLATFORM))ifend```Comments work by adding a semi-colon at the start of the line```; these   ; lines   ; will    ; be      ; skipped ```**Comments only work from the start of the line**There is also a list of helper functions| Function Name | Arguments | Description | Introduced|---|---|---|---|| wildcard$ | str1 | Evaluates a list of space separated globs into a space separated list of files | v1.0.0| remove$ | str1, str2, str3... | Removes str2 onwards from a space separated list of strings | v1.0.0| replace$ | str1, str2, str3... | Replaces str2,4,6,8... with str3,5,7,9... in str1 | v1.0.3| eq$ | arg1, arg2 | Checks if two strings are equal | v1.0.0| neq$ | arg1, arg2 | Checks if two strings are unequal | v1.0.3| gt$ | arg1, arg2 | Checks if arg1 is greater than arg2 | v1.0.3| lt$ | arg1, arg2 | Checks if arg1 is lesser than arg2 | v1.0.3| gte$ | arg1, arg2 | Checks if arg1 is greater than or equal to arg2 | v1.0.3| lte$ | arg1, arg2 | Checks if arg1 is lesser than or equal to arg2 | v1.0.3| set$ | arg1 | | Checks if there is a variable with the name arg1 | v1.0.3 | notset$ | arg1 | Checks if there is not a variable with the name arg1 | v1.0.3 | and$ | arg1, arg2, arg3... | Ands all the booleans | v1.0.4| or$ | arg1, arg2, arg3... | Ors all the booleans | v1.0.4| not$ | arg1 | Nots the boolean | v1.0.4A list of important variables are| Variable | Is Set | Description | Introduced ||---|---|---|---|| PLATFORM | Yes | Equivalent of `os.name` | v1.0.0 || C_COMPILER | No | C compiler location set by `check_for` | v1.0.0 || CXX_COMPILER | No | C++ compiler location set by `check_for` | v1.0.0 || ASM_INTEL_COMPILER | No | Intel Assembly assembler location set by `check_for` | v1.0.0 || ASM_ATT_COMPILER | No | AT&amp;T Assembly assembler location set by `check_for` | v1.0.0 || SHARED_COMPILER | No | Linker location for shared libraries set by `check_for` | v1.0.0 || STATIC_COMPILER | No | Linker location for static libraries set by `check_for` | v1.0.2 || OUTPUT | No | Output file generated by linking | v1.0.0 || C_STD | No | The C std used (just the number like 17, 11, etc.) | v1.0.0 || CXX_STD | No | The C++ std used (just the number like 17, 11, etc.) | v1.0.0 || BUILD_DIR | No | The directory to build the objects in | v1.0.1 || OUTPUT_DIR | No | The directory to output the finished objects in in | v1.0.1 || C_FLAGS | No | Flags passed to C compiler | v1.0.2 || CXX_FLAGS | No | Flags passed to C++ compiler | v1.0.2 || ASM_INTEL_FLAGS | No | Flags passed to Intel Assembly assembler | v1.0.2 || ASM_ATT_FLAGS | No | Flags passed to AT&amp;T Assembly assembler | v1.0.2 || SHARED_FLAGS | No | Flags passed to shared library linker | v1.0.2 || STATIC_FLAGS | No | Flags passed to static library linker | v1.0.2 |## How to clean the files```bashpython3 -m akbs --clean```## To-Do* [x] Build directory (milestone 1.0.1)* [x] Nested functions* [ ] Windows support* [ ] Optimization* [x] Subdirectories* [x] Ability to set compilers from `set()` and environment variables* [x] More if conditions* [x] `replace$()` helper function* [x] --clean command* [x] Documenting my code + Readable variables* [x] C_FLAGS, CXX_FLAGS, ASM...* [x] Cache install locations (milestone 1.0.2)* [x] Ability to set target architecture (Use CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS)* [ ] Plugin Support* [x] Make `print` and `exit` a function, not a statement* [ ] Make comments work in the middle of a line</longdescription>

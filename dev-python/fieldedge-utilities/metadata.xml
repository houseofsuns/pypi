	<longdescription># Inmarsat FieldEdge UtilitiesInmarsat FieldEdge project supports *Internet of Things* (**IoT**) usingsatellite communications technology. Generally this library is meant to be usedon single board computers capable of running Debian Linux.&gt;*While the authors recognize Python has several shortcomings for embedded use,**it provides a useful learning template.*This library available on [**PyPI**](https://pypi.org/project/fieldedge-utilities/)provides:* A common **`logger`** format and wrapping file facility with UTC timestamps.* A **`timer.RepeatingTimer`** utility (thread) that can be started, stopped,restarted, and interval changed.* A simplified **`mqtt`** client that automatically (re)onnects(by default to a local `fieldedge-broker`).* Helper functions for managing files and **`path`** on different OS.* An interface for the FieldEdge **`hostpipe`** service for sending hostcommands from a Docker container, with request/result captured in a logfile.* Helper functions **`ip.interfaces`** for finding and validating IP interfacesand addresses/subnets.* A defined set of common **`ip.protocols`** used for packet analysis andsatellite data traffic optimisation.* Helpers for managing **`serial`** ports on a host system.* Utilities for converting **`timestamp`**s between unix and ISO 8601* Classes useful for implementing **`microservice`**s based on MQTTinter-service communications and task workflows:    * **`interservice`** communications tasks and searchable queue.    * **`microservice`** class for consistent abstraction and interaction.    * **`msproxy`** microservice proxy class form a kind of twin of another    microservice, as a child of a microservice.    * **`feature`** class as a child of a microservice, with routing of MQTT    topics and messages and interaction with a simple task queue.    * **`properties`** manipulation and conversion between JSON and PEP style,    and derived from classes or instances.    * **`propertycache`** concept for caching frequently referenced object    properties where the query may take time.    * **`subscriptionproxy`** allows cascading of received MQTT messages to    multiple modules within a project framing a microservice.[Docmentation](https://inmarsat-enterprise.github.io/fieldedge-utilities/)</longdescription>

	<longdescription>setuptools-version-command==========================*Get version from version control instead of hardcoding it into setup.py*⚠ DEPRECATION NOTICE ⚠----------------------This package is no longer maintained. It will not evolve along with the Pythonpackaging ecosystem. Specifically, as of November 2021, it will not work withstatic metadata defined in `setup.cfg` as opposed to metadata defined in`setup.py`.There is a good alternative: use `setuptools-scm`_ instead. This is easy toset up in a `setup.cfg`, see the PyPA `Packaging Python projects`_ tutorial... _setuptools-scm: https://pypi.org/project/setuptools-scm/.. _Packaging Python projects: https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/introduction------------Instead of hardcoding the version in ``setup.py`` like this:.. code-block:: python    setup(        name='some-dist-name',        version='1.0',        ...)This package allows specifying a VCS command like this:.. code-block:: python    setup(        name='some-dist-name',        version_command='git describe',        ...)...Which will then update the version into``some-dist-name.egg-info/version.txt``, so that the version can also be foundif ``setup.py`` is being run from an sdist or something.When it can find the version from either``some-dist-name.egg-info/version.txt`` or the output of the``version_command``, it will update the version key that is normally used forthe version, such as what's used in the sdist filename and so on.setup keyword-------------Instead of specifying the ``version`` keyword argument, specify the``version_command`` keyword argument. It can either be a str or a tuple. Ifit's a str, it's interpreted as just the command to execute, for example ``gitdescribe``. If it's a tuple, it must have two or three elements, and have theform ``(command, pep440_mode[, post_mode])``. ``pep440_mode`` can only bespecified in the tuple of ``version_argument``, not as separateargument of ``setup``.A list of possible values for tuples passed to the ``version_command`` keywordargument::``command``: Must be ``&quot;git describe&quot;``, but could also support other VCS in    the future.:``pep440_mode`` = ``None``: Takes output of command as is, so ignores PEP440.    ``pip`` and ``setuptools`` will throw warnings.:``pep440_mode`` = ``&quot;pep440-git-local&quot;``: Moves number of commits and hash as    local identifier:    * Change ``1.2.3`` to ``1.2.3``    * Change ``1.2.3-10-abc1234`` to ``1.2.3+git-10-abc1234``:``pep440_mode`` = ``&quot;pep440-git-dev&quot;``: (Deprecated) Adds rhe number of    commits since a git tag as a .dev tag:    * Change ``1.2.3-N-abc1234`` to ``1.2.3.devN``    This is against PEP440-specification and supported only for backwards    compatibility. It may be removed in time.:``pep440_mode`` = ``&quot;pep440-git&quot;``: Works with pre-release versions (alpha,    beta, rc etc), post-release versions (post, rev, etc) and dev versions.    * Leave ``1.2.3.dev`` and ``1.2.3.dev0`` as they are    * Change ``1.2.3.dev-N-abc1234`` to ``1.2.3.devN``    * Change ``1.2.3a-N-ab1234`` to ``1.2.3aN``    * Change ``1.2.3`` to ``1.2.3``    * Change ``1.2.3-10-abcd123`` to ``1.2.3.post10``, or ``1.2.3-rev10``, as      you prefer    In other words, a tag can be absent, open (implicitly or explicitly 0), or    closed (have a number greater than zero). If the last Git tag is an open    dev tag, that's the one that will be used for the revision number. If the    last Git tag is an open post-release tag, then that will be used. If the    last Git tag is an open pre-release tag, that will be used. In other cases,    a post-release tag will be added.:``pep440_mode`` = ``&quot;pep440-git-full``: Similar to ``&quot;pep440-git&quot;`` but    includes the commit hash and dirty marker (if present) in the local version    portion.    * Change ``1.2.3.dev-N-abc1234`` to ``1.2.3.devN+gabc1234``    * Change ``1.2.3-dirty`` to ``1.2.3+dirty``    * Change ``1.2.3-10-abcd123-dirty`` to ``1.2.3.post10+gabcd123.dirty``    The inclusion of the hash in the local identifier helps avoid ambiguity    between two versions that are the same number of commits from the latest    tag.    The inclusion of the dirty flag (which requires ``command`` value to    include the ``--dirty`` option) ensures that local uncommitted changes    are considered newer than the last set of committed changes.:``post_mode``: Template for adding post-release tags. Optional separator (dot,    dash or underscore), followed by ``&quot;post&quot;``, ``&quot;rev&quot;`` or ``&quot;r&quot;``, followed    by another optional separator. Can also be a single dash. Default is    ``&quot;.post&quot;``.    Given a git describe output of ``1.2a3-4-abcd123``:    * ``&quot;.post&quot;`` gives ``1.2a3.post4``    * ``&quot;.rev_&quot;`` gives ``1.2a3.rev_4``    * ``&quot;-&quot;`` gives ``1.2a3-4``installation------------To use it, just do this:.. code-block:: shell    pip install setuptools-version-commandWith the pip of the global python. (Or use ``--user``.)testing-------To test it, run ``./setup.py --version``.developing----------Within a checkout of this repo:.. code-block:: shell    virtualenv env    env/bin/pip install --editable .    env/bin/python setup.py --versionMake sure that you change the ``setup.py`` so that it actually makes use ofsetuptools-version-command.</longdescription>

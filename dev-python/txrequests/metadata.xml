	<longdescription>Asynchronous Python HTTP Requests for Humans============================================.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/tardyp/txrequests.png?branch=master        :target: https://travis-ci.org/tardyp/txrequestsSmall add-on for the python requests_ http library. Makes use twisted's ThreadPool,so that the requests'API returns deferredThe additional API and changes are minimal and strives to avoid surprises.The following synchronous code:.. code-block:: python    from requests import Session    session = Session()    # first requests starts and blocks until finished    response_one = session.get('http://httpbin.org/get')    # second request starts once first is finished    response_two = session.get('http://httpbin.org/get?foo=bar')    # both requests are complete    print('response one status: {0}'.format(response_one.status_code))    print(response_one.content)    print('response two status: {0}'.format(response_two.status_code))    print(response_two.content)Can be translated to make use of futures, and thus be asynchronous by creatinga FuturesSession and catching the returned Future in place of Response. TheResponse can be retrieved by calling the result method on the Future:.. code-block:: python    from txrequests import Session    from twisted.internet import defer    @defer.inlineCallbacks    def main():        # use with statement to cleanup session's threadpool, and connectionpool after use        # you can also use session.close() if want to use session for long term use        with Session() as session:            # first request is started in background            d1 = session.get('http://httpbin.org/get')            # second requests is started immediately            d2 = session.get('http://httpbin.org/get?foo=bar')            # wait for the first request to complete, if it hasn't already            response_one = yield d1            print('response one status: {0}'.format(response_one.status_code))            print(response_one.content)            # wait for the second request to complete, if it hasn't already            response_two = yield d2            print('response two status: {0}'.format(response_two.status_code))            print(response_two.content)By default a ThreadPool is created with 4 max workers. If you would like toadjust that value or share a threadpool across multiple sessions you can provideone to the Session constructor... code-block:: python    from twisted.python.threadpool import ThreadPool    from txrequests import Session    session = FuturesSession(pool=ThreadPool(maxthreads=10))    # ...As a shortcut in case of just increasing workers number you can pass`minthreads` and/or `maxthreads` straight to the `Session` constructor:.. code-block:: python    from txrequests import Session    session = Session(maxthreads=10)That's it. The api of requests.Session is preserved without any modificationsbeyond returning a Deferred rather than Response. As with all futures exceptionsare shifted to the deferred errback.Working in the Background=========================There is one additional parameter to the various request functions,background_callback, which allows you to work with the Response objects in thebackground thread. This can be useful for shifting work out of the foreground,for a simple example take json parsing... code-block:: python    from pprint import pprint    from txrequests import Session    from twisted.internet import defer    @defer.inlineCallbacks    def main():        with Session() as session:            def bg_cb(sess, resp):                # parse the json storing the result on the response object                resp.data = resp.json()                return resp            d = session.get('http://httpbin.org/get', background_callback=bg_cb)            # do some other stuff, send some more requests while this one works            response = yield d            print('response status {0}'.format(response.status_code))            # data will have been attached to the response object in the background            pprint(response.data)Installation============    pip install txrequestsCredits========txrequests is based on requests_future_, from Ross McFarland.. _`requests`: https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests.. _`requests_future`: https://github.com/ross/requests-futures</longdescription>

Grab project```git clone https://github.com/JeffersonLab/jaws-libpcd jaws-libp```2. Launch [Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose)```docker compose up```3. Monitor active alarms```docker exec -it jaws-libp list_activations --monitor```4. Trip an alarm```docker exec jaws-libp set_activation alarm1```**Note**: The docker-compose services require significant system resources - tested with 4 CPUs and 4GB memory.**See**: [Docker Compose Strategy](https://gist.github.com/slominskir/a7da801e8259f5974c978f9c3091d52c)## InstallRequires [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/)```pip install jaws-libp```**Note**: Using newer versions of Python may be problematic because the dependency `confluent-kafka` uses librdkafka, which often does not have a wheel file prepared for later versions of Python, meaning setuptools will attempt to compile it for you, and that often doesn't work (especially on Windows).   Python 3.9 does have a wheel file for confluent-kafka so that's your safest bet.  Wheel files also generally only are prepared for Windows, MacOS, and Linux.  Plus only for architectures x86_64 and arm64, also only for glibc.  If you use with musl libc or linux-aarch64 then you'll likely have to compile librdkafka yourself from source.## API[Sphinx Docs](https://jeffersonlab.github.io/jaws-libp/)## ConfigureEnvironment variables are used to configure jaws-libp:| Name             | Description                                                                                                                ||------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|| BOOTSTRAP_SERVER | Host and port pair pointing to a Kafka server to bootstrap the client connection to a Kafka Cluster; example: `kafka:9092` || SCHEMA_REGISTRY  | URL to Confluent Schema Registry; example: `http://registry:8081`                                                          |The Docker container can optionally handle the following environment variables as well:| Name             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ||------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|| ALARM_LOCATIONS  | Path to an alarm locations file to import ([example file](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/jaws/blob/main/examples/data/locations)), else an https URL to a file, else a comma separated list of location definitions with fields separated by the pipe symbol.

The [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) tool can be used to download dependencies.```git clone https://github.com/JeffersonLab/jaws-libpcd jaws-libppython -m venv .venv_dev --upgrade-deps```Activate the virtual env using your [shell specific command](https://gist.github.com/slominskir/e7ed71317ea24fc19b97a0ec006ff4f1#activate-dev-virtual-environment), then install in editable mode with dev deps and run build:```pip install -e .[dev]python -m build```**Note for JLab On-Site Users**: Jefferson Lab has an intercepting [proxy](https://gist.github.com/slominskir/92c25a033db93a90184a5994e71d0b78)**See**: [Python Development Notes](https://gist.github.com/slominskir/e7ed71317ea24fc19b97a0ec006ff4f1)## DevelopSet up the build environment following the [Build](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/jaws-libp#build) instructions.In order to iterate rapidly when making changes it's often useful to run the Python scripts directly on the local workstation, perhaps leveraging an IDE.  In this scenario run the service dependencies with Docker Compose:```docker compose -f deps.yml up```**Note**: The environment variable defaults work in this scenario and are defined as:`BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS=localhost:9094` and `SCHEMA_REGISTRY=http://localhost:8081`## TestThe integration tests depend on a running Kafka instance, generally in Docker.  The tests run automatically via the [CI](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/jaws-libp/actions/workflows/ci.yml) GitHub Action on every commit (unless `[no ci]` is included in the commit message).  The tests can be run locally during development.  Set up the development environment following the [Develop](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/jaws-libp#develop) instructions.  Then with the `deps.yml` Docker containers running and the build virtual environment activated run:```pytest```## Release1. Bump the version number in pyproject.toml and commit and push to GitHub (using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)).   1. Create a new release on the GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/jaws-libp/releases) page corresponding to same version in pyproject.toml (Enumerate changes and link issues).1. [Publish to PyPi](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/jaws-libp/actions/workflows/pypi-publish.yml) GitHub Action should run automatically.1. [Publish to gh-pages](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/jaws-libp/actions/workflows/gh-pages-publish.yml) GitHub Action should run automatically.1. [Publish to DockerHub](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/jaws-libp/actions/workflows/docker-publish.yml) GitHub Action should run automatically.1. Bump and commit quick start [image version](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/jaws-libp/blob/main/docker-compose.override.yml) after confirming new image works## See Also - [jaws-libj (Java)](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/jaws-libj) - [Developer Notes](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/jaws-libp/wiki/Developer-Notes)</longdescription>

	<longdescription># ionical: Keep an eye on ical!- **ionical** is a command line tool for tracking schedule changes      in iCalendar feeds (downloadable .ics files):      - Download and compare sets of iCalendar files obtained on         different dates to generate changelogs of added/removed events.      - View current schedules, optionally filtered by start date        or event summary text.    - Classify events based on user-specified criteria        (e.g., categorize events whose start time falls between        range Xpm-Ypm as being &quot;Workshift A&quot; events, and those with        start times in a different range as &quot;Workshift B&quot; events).      - Export filtered events from calendars to CSV files,        using user-specified filter criteria (e.g., workshifts)        and user-specified formatting.  - Limitations:     - ionical only deals with iCalendar start times        and summary text fields, and ignores other fields.        This proves adequate for many simple use cases (e.g., it was        designed to track changes to employee schedules on        [Amion](https://amion.com/), and has worked well for that).  For iCalendar management        involving additional fields or more complex use cases, you'll need to        look at other tools (or submit a pull request! :) ).## Installing via pip:```$ pip install ionical$ ionical```- The first time you run ionical there will be no    ionical_config.toml file present, and you'll be    prompted to generate one (in the current directory).    Once it is created, you can add the names and URLs    for calendars you want to track/monitor, and specify    multilple other configuration options. ## Installing for development from GitHub:```$ git clone https://github.com/danyul/ionical$ cd ionical$ python3 -m venv env$ source env/bin/activate$ pip install -e &quot;.[dev]&quot;$ python -m ionical```- If on Windows, replace:  - **'source env/bin/activate'** with **'.\env\Scripts\activate'**  - **'python3'** with **'python'**## Command line usage ('ionical -h' output):```Usage: ionical [-h] [-v] [-V]               [-f CONFIG_DIRECTORY] [-d ICS_DIR]               [-g] [-s] [-l [#_COMPARISONS]] [-c [CSV_FILE]]               [-i NAME [NAME ...]]               [-a DATE_OR_NUMBER] [-b DATE_OR_NUMBER] [-t TEXT [TEXT ...]]Keep an eye on ical!  ionical is a CLI tool to track iCalendar changes.Help/About:  -h, --help           Print help message, then exit.  -v, --verbose        Increase the level of printed feeedback.  -V, --version        Print version, then exit.File Locations:  Specify expected locations for config files and calendar downloads.  -f CONFIG_DIRECTORY  Directory where config file ionical_config.toml located.                       This file will contain basic calendar information                       (names, URLs for .ics files, and timezones) and allows                       various additional configuration options.                       See README file for an example, or run 'ionical' to                       generate a sample config file which may then be edited.                       (default: current directory)  -d ICS_DIR           Directory for downloading/accessing .ics files.                       (default: current directory)Actions:  One or more action options MUST be specified.  -g, --get_today      Download current .ics files and label them with today's                       date. This will be done prior to other actions.                       (If this is left unspecified, operations will only use                       .ics files that have been previously downloaded.)  -s, --show           Display events from most recent ical file version for                       each calendar.  -l [#_COMPARISONS]   Show changelogs comparing calendar versions from                       multiple dates. Optionally, specify the number of                       prior versions (per each calendar) for which to show                       comparison changelogs. (If left unspecified,                       #_COMPARISONS default is 2.)  -c [CSV_FILE]        Export calendar events to csv.Calendar Filters:  Restrict all actions to a subset of calendars.  -i NAME [NAME ...]   Only operate on calendars with a specified NAME.                       (If -i not specified, operate on every calendar                       listed in ionical_config.toml.)Event Filters:  Filter events shown in changelogs, schedule displays  -a DATE_OR_NUMBER    Only include events that start AFTER a specified date.                       (I.e., exclude events starting before the date.)                       Value must be EITHER a date in format YYYY-MM-DD, or                       a positive integer representing # of days in the past                       (If option unspecified, default behavior is to exclude                       any events starting prior to 1 day ago.)  -b DATE_OR_NUMBER    Only include events that start BEFORE a specified date.                       (I.e., exclude events starting on or after the date.)                       Value must be EITHER a date in format YYYY-MM-DD, or                       a positive integer representing # of days in the future.                       (If option unspecified, default behavior is to                       have no upper limit on event dates.)  -t TEXT [TEXT ...]   Only include events whose summary text includes words                       that match at least one TEXT item.  TEXT items can be                       either a single word or phrases comprised of words and                       spaces.  If the latter, you must enclose TEXT within                       quotation marks.                       (If option not specified, no text filters are applied.)```## ionical configuration file:```# ionical_config.tomltitle = &quot;ionical configuration file&quot;verbose = true# Note: All options that can be specified on the command line may  # alternatively be specified in this config file.

Listing of pytz timezones [can be found here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13866926/is-there-a-list-of-pytz-timezones). - The calendar **NAME**:     - Serves as an ID when asking ionical (via -i option)           to restrict actions to a subset of calendars.     - Serves as the leftmost part of the filename for         downloaded ics files.     - Shouldn't have spaces or non-alphanumeric characters.   - The calendar **LONG NAME**:     - Is used for display purposes.## Note on filename format for downloaded ics files:    Downloaded .ics files have a filename format of       ABC123__20200314.ics,  where &quot;ABC123&quot; is a name      identifier. (A reasonable name for a calendar      which tracks an employee's work schedule might      be a last name or an employee ID number.) Names      should contain only alphanumeric characters.      &quot;20200314&quot; indicates that this particular version      of the calendar was downloaded on March 14, 2020.  # Libraries used- [icalendar](https://pypi.org/project/icalendar/)- [pytz](https://pypi.org/project/pytz/)- [recurring_ical_events](https://pypi.org/project/recurring-ical-events/)  (which, in turn, uses [python-dateutil](https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/))- [toml](https://pypi.org/project/toml/)# Related projects - [icalevents](https://github.com/irgangla/icalevents)- [gcalcii](https://github.com/insanum/gcalcli)- [vobject](https://pypi.org/project/vobject/)# 0.1.0Initial release# 0.2.0 (12/8/2020)- Substantial help message cleanup- Changed/renamed multiple CLI options# 0.2.5 (12/9/2020)- Google Calendar event viewing working# 0.3.0 - Removed hacky csv functionality for now</longdescription>

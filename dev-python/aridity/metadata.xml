	<longdescription># aridityDRY config and template system, easily extensible with Python## The Arid Manifesto* Keys are paths to avoid concatenation* It's never necessary to repeat a value* Minimal syntax for surprise-free authoring* Evaluation lazy and influenced by context* Strongly (dynamically) typed values* Central defaulting rather than at call sites* Templating using same syntax as expressions* Easy to correctly quote/escape values in templates* Extensibility via user-defined functions* Easy tasks are easy, hard tasks are possible* Many applications can share one user config* Principle of least astonishment driven design* Don't make users jump through hoops## Motivation* Environment variables are too crude to configure non-trivial apps, and maybe even trivial apps in the cloud    * They do not support nested data or lists, without some encoding scheme implemented in app code or a lib    * Multiple bespoke encoding schemes in the system are an error-prone maintenance burden worth avoiding* Testing code that queries the environment directly comes with a big risk of leaking state between tests* Often tools/libraries must be configured using config files    * Support for config file interpolation is not enough to stay DRY, and comes with a different set of gotchas per tool    * In particular Helm/Terraform have their own ways of sharing config between envs* aridity is a general purpose solution for all the above, also see [soak](https://github.com/combatopera/soak)## Config API* Normally you pass around a Config object, and application code can get data out via attribute access e.g. config.foo.bar    * Here config.foo is also a Config object, a child scope of config named foo    * The passing around can be taken care of by a dependency injection container such as [diapyr](https://github.com/combatopera/diapyr)* Every Config has an associated ConfigCtrl on which Python API such as processtemplate is available    * Use negation to get ConfigCtrl when you have a Config e.g. (-config).processtemplate(...)    * Use the node attribute to get Config when you have a ConfigCtrl, this is a rare situation in practice* When unit testing a class or function that expects a Config object, you can use SimpleNamespace to mock one## Guidelines* Config files have the extension .arid and templates .aridt* A template is simply a file-sized aridity expression    * Conventionally the template processor sets &quot; to the appropriate quote function for the file format, e.g. jsonquote for JSON/YAML* Instead of adding Python objects to the config in main, it's tidier to use aridity's pyref function to achieve this* When some value needs to be constructed using concatenation, consider whether it would be more tasteful to do this in the config## Feature switch* Sometimes we want to deploy a change, but something in production isn't ready for that change* A feature switch allows deployment to production in this case* Add a boolean to the base config (conventionally root.arid) e.g. foo enabled = true    * This value should be the configuration that we eventually want in all environments* In production config, override with foo enabled = false* In the code, read config.foo.enabled and enable the change based on this boolean* The above can now be deployed to all environments, and is not a blocker for other changes* Later when production is ready for it, it's a 1 line change to remove the override from production config## InstallThese are generic installation instructions.### To use, permanentlyThe quickest way to get started is to install the current release from PyPI:```pip3 install --user aridity```### To use, temporarilyIf you prefer to keep .local clean, install to a virtualenv:```python3 -m venv venvnamevenvname/bin/pip install aridity. venvname/bin/activate```### To developFirst clone the repo using HTTP or SSH:```git clone https://github.com/combatopera/aridity.gitgit clone git@github.com:combatopera/aridity.git```Now use pyven's pipify to create a setup.py, which pip can then use to install the project editably:```python3 -m venv pyvenvenvpyvenvenv/bin/pip install pyvenpyvenvenv/bin/pipify ariditypython3 -m venv venvnamevenvname/bin/pip install -e aridity. venvname/bin/activate```## Config file syntax```: Until aridity gets support for comments, you can use the colon directive to ignore data.: Directives MUST be separated from data by whitespace, and are typically punctuation.: Here's the equals directive:foo = bar: This does what you'd expect - assign the string value bar to foo.: Observe that bar isn't quoted, values in aridity are normally barewords.: foo is actually a path of length 1, path components are whitespace-separated:this is a path = this is a value: Any existing assignment can be overridden:foo = bazthis is a path = this is different: Internal whitespace in values is preserved (leading and trailing whitespace is not):two sentences = Some like 2 spaces.  After a full stop.: You can use indentation to avoid typing a common path prefix multiple times:app1 feature1    data1 = value1    data2 = value2app2    feature1 data = value3    feature2        data1 = value4        data2 = value5: Exactly the same effect without using indentation:app1 feature1 data1 = value1app1 feature1 data2 = value2app2 feature1 data = value3app2 feature2 data1 = value4app2 feature2 data2 = value5: The right hand side of an equals is actually an expression.: In an expression, a dollar sign with brackets can be used to refer to another path:has value    bar = $(foo)    value3 = $(app2 feature1 data): Round brackets and square brackets have exactly the same effect:also has value bar = $[foo]: Values can be concatenated:two bars    without spacing = $(foo)$(foo)    with one space  = $(foo) $(foo)    with 2 spaces   = $(foo)  $(foo): A few paths are predefined in every new context, such as:home directory = $(~): To get a literal dollar there is a special form for quoting:financial report = $'(We lost $100 on Friday.): Be careful with nested brackets, the first matching bracket ends the special form:behaviour    expected   = $'[Lunch cost $20 (worth it though).]    unexpected = $'(Lunch cost $20 (worth it though).): Another special form can be used to preserve leading/trailing whitespace:padded bars = $.( $(foo) $(foo) ): Brackets can span multiple lines:bar per line    without final newline = $.($(foo)$(foo))    with final newline = $.($(foo)$(foo)): Evaluation is lazy, the expression is what is actually (and eagerly) assigned to the path:no problem = $(this path will get a value later): If your use-case demands it, you can force eager evaluation:bar even if foo changes later := $(foo): When evaluating a path the local scope is examined first, then its parents if path not found:host    short path = nope    guest short path = yep    should be nope = $(short path)    guest should be yep = $(short path)does not work = $(short path): Use the dot directive to include config from another file:. /path/to/other/config.arid: Thus you can factor out any config that's common to multiple deployments, and override as needed.: It's possible (but maybe not so useful) to include under a non-trivial path:other stuff . /path/to/other/config.arid: There is no default context for relative paths, you must set cwd up-front as inclusion is not lazy:cwd = /path/to. other/config.arid: Text between dollar and open bracket (that isn't a special form) is a function name.: A useful function predefined in every new context is the platform slash:path = $/($(~) Desktop report.txt): Unlike most functions, / can also be used (less legibly) as a value:path = $(~)$(/)Desktop$(/)report.txt: All functions are first class objects that can be assigned and overridden in the usual ways:slash := $(/)/ = something elsepath = $slash($(~) Desktop report.txt): Simple lists can be created using the plus equals convenience directive.: Indentation means you don't have to repeat the directive for every list element:years +=    2018    2019years += 2020: A predefined join function takes a list and a separator and does what you'd expect:copyright = $join($(years) $.(, )): Observe that functions typically take values not identifiers, so you have to 'get' explicitly.: Lists are just a special case of nested scopes, which are much more powerful:person    $.(The Guardians) year = 2018    Greta year = 2019summary = Person of the Year was $join($map($(person) $.($label() in $(year))) $.(, )).: Here the predefined label function gives you access to the last path component of a list element.```## Templates* A template is simply an expression in a file, that may be quite large* These are typically used to create config files for other languages e.g. YAML, HCL    * Note that literal dollar signs must be quoted as above, everything else is safe* A processtemplate script is provided for basic processing```processtemplate app.json.aridt &lt;config.arid &gt;app.json```* Conventionally the `&quot;` path is set to the most useful escape function for the target format    * Brackets can be elided in function composition e.g. `$&quot;$(key)` is the same as `$&quot;($(key))`## Commands### arid-configPrint given config (with optional path in config) as shell snippet.### aridityInteractive REPL.### processtemplateProcess the given template to stdout using config from stdin.</longdescription>

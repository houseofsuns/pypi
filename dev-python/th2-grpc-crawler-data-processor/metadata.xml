	<longdescription># th2 gRPC crawler data processor library (0.3.2)This project contains the gRPC interface to implement if you want to create your own crawler data processor.The crawler data processor work with the [crawler](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-crawler)## How to transform template1. Create a directory with the same name as project name (use underscores instead of dashes) under `src/main/proto` directory (remove other files and directories if they exist).2. Place your custom `.proto` files in created directory. Pay attention to `package` specifier and `import` statements.3. Edit `release_version` and `vcs_url` properties in `gradle.properties` file.4. Edit `rootProject.name` variable in `settings.gradle` file. This will be the name of Java package.5. Edit `package_info.json` file in order to specify name and version for Python package (create file if it's absent).6. Edit parameters of `setup.py` in `setup` function invocation such as: `author`, `author_email`, `url`. Do not edit the others.7. Edit `README.md` file according to the new project.Note that the name of created directory under `src/main/proto` directory is used in Python (it's a package name).## How to maintain project1. Make your changes.2. Up version of Java package in `gradle.properties` file.3. Up version of Python package in `package_info.json` file.4. Commit everything.## How to run project### JavaIf you wish to manually create and publish package for Java, run these command:```gradle --no-daemon clean build publish artifactoryPublish \       -Pbintray_user=${BINTRAY_USER} \       -Pbintray_key=${BINTRAY_KEY}````BINTRAY_USER` and `BINTRAY_KEY` are parameters for publishing.### PythonIf you wish to manually create and publish package for Python:1. Generate services by gradle:    ```       gradle --no-daemon clean generateProto    ```    You can find the generated files by following path: `src/gen/main/services/python`2. Generate code from `.proto` files and publish everything:    ```    pip install -r requirements.txt    python setup.py generate    python setup.py sdist    twine upload --repository-url ${PYPI_REPOSITORY_URL} --username ${PYPI_USER} --password ${PYPI_PASSWORD} dist/*    ```    `PYPI_REPOSITORY_URL`, `PYPI_USER` and `PYPI_PASSWORD` are parameters for publishing.## Changes:### 0.3.1+ Update `th2-grpc-data-provider` Python dependency from `0.1.4` to `0.1.6` ### 0.3.0+ Update `th2-bom` from `3.0.0` to `3.1.0` + Update `th2-grpc-common` from `3.1.2` to `3.8.0`+ Add stubs for Python### 0.2.0 (Breaking changes)#### Breaking:+ Use list of `MessageID` instead of mapping between session and `MessageID`.  User now will have to specify `MessageID` for both directions in the response if he or she needs to set a checkpoint.  The list should contain a single `MessageID` for each pair `alias + direction`.  If more than one is found the last one (according to their sequences) will be taken.+ The rpc methods was renamed according to the Protobuf naming convention (uses PascalCase).+ The event and message IDs from the response to connect method are removed because this functionality requires additional improvements on Crawler's side.#### Added:+ New method that will be invoked by the crawler each time the new interval is started.</longdescription>

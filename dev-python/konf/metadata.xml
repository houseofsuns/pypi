	<longdescription>|Build Status|Konf====Tiny tool that designed to solve problems of Python configuration files located outside of VCS.Installation:.. code:: bash    pip install konfRunning tests:.. code:: bash    nosetestsWhy Konf?=========Sometimes there is a need to get some settings outside of Python code and then to use them in an application. This can be secret keys, authentication tokens, URLs of third-party services, or other settings which depends on the server. Developers (or IT engineers) are faced with several challenges:-  Validation of data importing from config. It may be simple typing, matching with range of possible values or with regexes.-  Respect of all settings. Check that config contains all required data. Also, it can be useful to check that there are no extra (redundant) things inside a config (because it can be the data, forgotten to consider in an application).-  Understanding what happens when something goes wrong. Correct representational exceptions allows immediately understand (just having looked at logs) what the problem is. Useful when deploying servers.Features:=========-  Allows to DRY import variables-  Readability for humans-  JSON and YAML support out of the box (In fact, additional libraries will be automatically installed for support it)-  Typing or validation of all importing data. And this is **required** because human factor prevention-  Python 2.7, 3+ compatible-  100% code coverage-  Custom format of configuration files can be used. If I missed and at now anyone uses something else except of supported formats, you can create an `issue &lt;https://github.com/vartagg/konf/issues&gt;`__ about it, and probably the new format will be supported in next versions.For Python data structures validation is used excellent library`kolypto/py-good &lt;https://github.com/kolypto/py-good&gt;`__For YAML parsing is used a great lib of Kirill Simonov`PyYAML &lt;http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML&gt;`__Quick start===========Just look at the code... code:: python    from konf import Konf    # Filling of variables from config file tokens.yaml in k_ object    k_ = Konf('tokens.yaml')    # Getting variables from k_: first argument is a name of variable (specified in the config),    # second can be a type or validator    SECRET_KEY = k_('secret_key', basestring)    AUTH_TOKEN = k_('auth_token', basestring)    # In the next example is used a validator: list, that must contain    # only objects with basestring type (str or unicode)    CLIENTS = k_('clients', [basestring])    # And dict with two required keys with appropriate types    DELAYS = k_('delays', {'case1': int, 'case2': int})You can find more details and advanced examples about natural validation on`good &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/good&gt;`__pageOk, what happened next? Imagine that tokens.yaml is missing. In case of this, after the script execution, we can see next exception message:.. code:: pytb    konf.main.ReadError: Can`t access to the configuration file &quot;tokens.yaml&quot;Let's create a file tokens.yaml and input next:.. code:: yaml    ---      secret_key: FOO      auth_token: BAR      clients: Q,      delays:        case1: 15        case2: 17Exception is raised:.. code:: pytb    Traceback (most recent call last):      File &quot;/Users/me/python/examples/example.py&quot;, line 19, in &lt;module&gt;        CLIENTS = k_('clients', [basestring])      File &quot;/Users/me/python/examples/konf/konf/main.py&quot;, line 126, in __call__        raise self.ValidationError(e)    konf.main.ValidationError: expected a listThen fix this mistake:.. code:: yaml    ---      secret_key: FOO      auth_token: BAR      clients: [Q]      delays:        case1: 15        case2: 17Now all be OK, because ``[Q]`` represents a list of values, not a string. **Note**: you can see the list of all supported exceptions in the end of this documentation page. Default values==============Do you need to use a value if any variable is not contained in a config file? You can use default value... code:: python    from konf import Konf    k_ = Konf('extra.yml')    # 3rd arg is a default. If variable STRICT is not contained in config file,    # USE_STRICT will be False    USE_STRICT = k_('STRICT', bool, False)    # You can also use None as default value    WINNER = k_('WINNER', int, None)    # Default values will never be validated, because you forcibly declaring it.    # So, the next example is legit.    SHIFT_TIME = k_('SHIFT', int, complex(42, 42))Checking redundant variables============================Sometimes you want to be sure that all of the variables in a config file are used and you haven't forgotten anything.In this situation the ``check_redundant()`` method can be helpful... code:: python    from konf import Konf    k_ = Konf('bar.yaml')    FOO1 = k_('foo1', int)    FOO2 = k_('foo2', int)    # If config file contains anything except foo1 and foo2,    # RedundantConfigError will be raised after call of this method!    k_.check_redundant()  # FailDefault values and ``check_redundant()`` also working fine together... code:: python    from konf import Konf    k_ = Konf('foo.yaml')    X = k_('X', int, 0)    Y = k_('Y', int, 0)    # If X and Y doesn't contained in the config file, RedundantConfigError will not be raised    # after next line of code, because they have default values.     # So, it's just like X == 0 and Y == 0    k_.check_redundant()  # SuccessMore complex example====================Write the content to a social_auth.yml in a readable form:.. code:: yaml   ---     SN:       vk:         key: '123'         secret: qwerty       google:         key: '456'         secret: uiop       twitter:         key: '789'         secret: zxc       ok:         key: '000'         secret: vbn         public_name: mStep-by-step process it in settings.py.. code:: python   # 0. Select configuration file   k_ = Konf('social_auth.yml')   # 1. Declare validators   # You can cache validators inside a Konf object as if it's a standard python dict   k_['v1'] = {      'key': basestring,      'secret': basestring,   }   k_['v2'] = {      'key': basestring,      'secret': basestring,      'public_name': basestring   }   # 2. Get variables from config   # For avoid copy-paste and massive chunks of code, just declare a new variable   # and pass data from config to it   sn = k_('SN', {      'vk': k_['v1'],  # You can choose validator you want, for example v1...      'google': k_['v1'],      'twitter': k_['v1'],      'ok': k_['v2']  # ...or v2   })   # 3. Fill everything to a python variables which are required for 3rd-party library   SOCIAL_AUTH_VK_OAUTH2_KEY = sn['vk']['key']   SOCIAL_AUTH_VK_OAUTH2_SECRET = sn['vk']['secret']   SOCIAL_AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_KEY = sn['google']['key']   SOCIAL_AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_SECRET = sn['google']['secret']   SOCIAL_AUTH_TWITTER_KEY = sn['twitter']['key']   SOCIAL_AUTH_TWITTER_SECRET = sn['twitter']['secret']   SOCIAL_AUTH_ODNOKLASSNIKI_KEY = sn['ok']['key']   SOCIAL_AUTH_ODNOKLASSNIKI_SECRET = sn['ok']['secret']   SOCIAL_AUTH_ODNOKLASSNIKI_OAUTH2_PUBLIC_NAME = sn['ok']['public_name']   # 4. Check that config doesn't contain some garbage   # (this might mean you forgot to get these variables, or this config is wrong, some draft for example)   k_.check_redundant()   # 5. If server is running without errors, and you will meet issue with this 3rd-party library later,   # you can be sure that problem isn't in your configuration file.   # Otherwise, you'll just catch a error on a start server stage.List of supported Exceptions====================================================     ===================================================================================     Exception                                     Raises when...========================     ===================================================================================ValidationError              Data from config file doesn't match to the ``type_or_validator`` argIncompleteConfigError        Trying to get variable that not contained in a config fileReadError                    Config file can't be readParseError                   Third-party parser can't parse configuration fileReassignmentError            Variable is loaded not for the first timeFileExtensionError           Extension of the config isn't supported, and ``parse_callback`` arg isn't specifiedRedundantConfigError         Call of ``check_redundant()`` if any of variables in a config isn't used in appValidatorManagementError     Incorrect usage of validators========================     ===================================================================================.. |Build Status| image:: https://travis-ci.org/vartagg/konf.svg?branch=master   :target: https://travis-ci.org/vartagg/konf</longdescription>

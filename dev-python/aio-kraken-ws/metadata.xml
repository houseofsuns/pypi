Looking for automated trading tools? [Botcrypto](https://botcrypto.io) may interest you.## Key features- Subscribe to kraken data using a single WebSocket.- Trigger a callback that is coroutine on each new closed candles from kraken.- Easy subscribe/unsubscribe to datasets, i.e. [(pair, Unit Time)] ex: [('XBT/EUR', 1)].- Callback is regularly triggered at each end of the UT intervals, whatever is the number of data received by kraken.## Getting started#### Install`pip install aio-kraken-ws`#### Usage```python# check tests/learning/log_to_file.py for a complete exampleasync def callback(pair, interval, timestamp, o, h, l, c, v):    &quot;&quot;&quot; A coroutine handling new candles.    :param str pair:    :param int interval: time in minutes    :param int timestamp: candle open timestamp.    :param float o: open price    :param float h: high price    :param float l: low price    :param float c: close price    :param float v: volume    &quot;&quot;&quot;    with open(&quot;candles.txt&quot;, &quot;a+&quot;) as file:        file.write(f&quot;[{pair}:{interval}]({timestamp},{o},{h},{l},{c},{v})\n&quot;)kraken_ws = await KrakenWs.create(callback)# subscribe to some datasetskraken_ws.subscribe([(&quot;XBT/EUR&quot;, 1), (&quot;ETH/EUR&quot;, 5)])```The `callback` function is called for each dataset at the end of each dataset's unit time interval.E.g. if subscription start at 4h42.05 to the dataset `(&quot;XBT/EUR&quot;, 1)`, then callback is triggered at 4h43.00, at 4h44.00, at 4h45.00, etc... For `(&quot;XBT/EUR&quot;, 60)`, it would be at 5h00.00, at 6h00.00, etc... It's possible to get at most 10ms delay between the exact UT interval ending and the actual datetime of the call.If **no** new data were received from Kraken during an interval, the callback is triggered with the latest known close price and v=0, as it's described in the following example.E.g.```pythonkraken_ws.subscribe([(&quot;XBT/EUR&quot;, 1)])# time.time() = 120await callback(&quot;XBT/EUR&quot;, 1, 60, 42.0, 57.0, 19.0, 24.0, 150.0)# time.time() = 180await callback(&quot;XBT/EUR&quot;, 1, 120, 19.0, 24.0, 8.0, 10.0, 13.0)# time.time() = 240 : no data received in 60s, i.e. no activityawait callback(&quot;XBT/EUR&quot;, 1, 180, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 0.0)```### Error management- An exception raised by the `callback` will be logged and it wont stop the streams- If kraken send an error message, an `ERROR` log is emitted with the kraken payload- If kraken send 'Subscription ohlc interval not supported', the related dataset is automatically unsubscribed#### WarningThe `callback` should takes less than a minute to process. If the `callback` takes more than a minutes, a *warning* is emitted and you may lose market data.Kraken WebSocket server manage **20 subscriptions maximum** per connection. Above 20 subscriptions, you may not receive all desired data.**Hopfully, aio-kraken-ws manage this limitation for you!** A new websocket connection is open every 20 subscriptions.Moreover, after 24h a subscriptions seem to expire and no more market data is receive. To ensure we do not lose the stream of market data, **aio-kraken-ws** automatically reconnect and re-subscribe to the datasets every 5 minutes.## TestsYou can find a working example of KrakenWs in `tests/learning/log_to_file.py`.### Run tests locallyClone the repo and install requirements```shpip install -e .[test]```Run the suite tests```sh# unit tests - no call to kraken - fastpytest --cov=aio_kraken_ws --cov-report= -v tests/unit# integration tests - actual kraken subscription - slowpytest --cov=aio_kraken_ws --cov-append -v -n 8 tests/integration```## ChangelogSee https://cdlr75.gitlab.io/aio-kraken-ws/CHANGELOG.html</longdescription>

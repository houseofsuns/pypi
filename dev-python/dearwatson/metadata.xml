To rule-out these scenarios, the Science Processing Operation Center (SPOC) of the NASA implemented the Data Validation (DV) Reports, which are showing different metrics to qualify or discard an analyzed candidate. These scenarios are mainly * Transit shape model fit* Odd-even transits checks, * Weak secondary events* Centroids shifts* Optical ghost effects* Transit source offsets* Rolling band contamination histogramsWATSON is also implementing similar but more simplified checks for all of those scenarios (SPOC fits transits models and we just compute the SNR of the possible candidate signal) except the rolling band contamination. In addition, we included a new check comparing the transit SNRs in the different available cadences and also all the single-transit plots computed with the official pipeline aperture and a smaller one. With all of these data, we compute metrics that might alert the scientist about problematic signals not complying with any of the thresholds.For more information check the docs: [https://dearwatson.readthedocs.io](https://dearwatson.readthedocs.io)## Code exampleLet's say that you found a new candidate in the TOI-175 with a period of 1.04 days (this is a known false positivefrom the TESS mission). You could run WATSON easily with the next code chunk:```period = 1.0491800670761966epoch = 1354.7155898963902duration_mins = 54depth_ppts = 0.158sectors = 'all'rp_rstar = 0.01205a_rstar = 9 ra = 124.531756290083dec = -68.3129998725044# We need to mask the previous candidates to ensure they don't add noise to the analysisknown_transits_mask = [{'P': 3.6906682312153136, 'T0': 1356.20298505518, 'D': 56},                  {'P': 2.2531273092040185, 'T0': 1354.9020729263193, 'D': 45},                  {'P': 7.450690528437917, 'T0': 1355.2917484673462, 'D': 69}]your_execution_dir = os.getcwd() object_dir = your_execution_dir + '/results'if not os.path.exists(object_dir):    os.mkdir(object_dir)Watson(object_dir).vetting(&quot;TIC 307210830&quot;, period, epoch, duration_mins, depth_ppts, sectors, rp_rstar,                                       a_rstar=a_rstar, cadence=120,                                       cpus=os.cpu_count() // 2,                                       transits_list=None, ra=ra,                                       dec=dec, clean=True, transits_mask=known_transits_mask)```This same example is done in one of our tutorials.

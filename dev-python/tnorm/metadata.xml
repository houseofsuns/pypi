	<longdescription># TNormTNorm is a package for computing the Thurston norm unit ball of finite volume orientable hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Currently, tnorm must be installed in Sage. There are two ways to get Tnorm up and running. Below is the easy way, scroll down for the hard way (not recommended).Installing Tnorm:Install the latest stable version of Sage_macOS, which is a version of Sage packaged by Marc Culler that makes everything work on a Mac without any headaches (thank you, Marc!):https://github.com/3-manifolds/Sage_macOS/releases/latest  (scroll to bottom and click on SageMath-9.X.dmg)After opening the installer, drag SageMath-9-X into the Applications folder, then be sure to install Recommended.pkg by double clicking on it and following the prompts.Next, open a terminal and open sage:$: sagethen install tnorm:sage: %pip install tnormIn the course of installing tnorm, Regina and SnapPy will be installed automatically.To run the tnorm graphical user interface app:$ sage -python -m tnorm.appTo get started:sage: W=tnorm.load('m130')sage: B=W.norm_ballsage: B.vertices()[Vertex 0: represented by (1/2)* S_1,2 at (-1), mapped from surface with index 10,Vertex 1: represented by (1/2)* S_1,2 at (1), mapped from surface with index 0]sage: Support for hyperbolic 3-manifolds that are not multi-component links in rational homology 3-spheres has been added very recently, and has not been thoroughly tested yet. If you get any results that don't make sense, please email me at william.worden@rice.edu.TO DO:* add feature: determine fiberedness of a hyp 3-mfld (this is a long-term goal)* remove Sage dependence (this has become low-priority, since installing in Sage is now easy).* better documentation throughout.The HARD(ish) way (not recommended, but left here to remind us how difficult things were in the old days!):1. Install latest Sage:1a. Download from http://mirrors.mit.edu/sage/osx/intel/index.html. Choose the most recent version, ending in x86_64.dmg.1b. double click on the downloaded file, then after it unpacks, copy the SageMath folder to your Applications folder2. Unquarantine sage:2a. open Terminal (in Applications/Utilities)2b. In terminal, type (without $ sign):  $ xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/SageMath(note: for the above, &quot;/Applications/&quot; is the path to SageMath. This may be different if you put it (for example) in the applications folder at the user lever, i.e., /Users/your_username/Applications/SageMath)2c. Open System Preferences —&gt; Security and Privacy —&gt; Privacy, then scroll on the left side down to &quot;Full Disk Access&quot; and select it. On the right side (after clicking the lock and entering password, if needed), click “+” button, then navigate to Applications/SageMath/ and select sage.3. Make a sage alias:3a. in Terminal, type $ open -e .bash_profile3b. this will open a file in TextEdit. At the top, add the line $ alias sage='/Applications/SageMath/sage'(change the path as needed if your SageMath is in a different location)4. Fix Sage’s SSL (this is now easy thanks to Nathan Dunfield):4a. Download https://github.com/3-manifolds/fix_mac_sage/releases/download/v1.0_as_released/fix_mac_sage9.tar.gz , then double click on it to unpack it.4b. In Terminal, type: $ cd ~/Downloads; sage -python -m fix_mac_sage9.fix5. Install tnorm (snappy and sageRegina will be installed automatically, if they are not already installed):5a: In Terminal, type: $ sage -python -m pip install tnorm</longdescription>

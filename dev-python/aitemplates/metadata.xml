	<longdescription># aitemplatesaitemplates is a Python package designed to simplify and streamline your work with the OpenAI API. It provides automatic function calling, helper classes, Python typing support, error checking, and a usage meter to help manage API costs. Additionally, aitemplates offers built-in examples of using ChromaDB and tools for efficient prompt engineering with OpenAI.## Features- **Function Integration**: Quick and easy integration with OpenAI functions for automatic execution and error handling.- **Error Checking**: Automatically catch and handle errors during API calls.- **Usage Meter**: Keep track of your OpenAI API usage with a built-in metering system.- **ChromaDB Integration**: Work directly with ChromaDB from the aitemplates interface.- **Asynchronous Chat Completions**: Use the `-asnc` flag to run asynchronous chat completions. The built-in `print_every` option prints every time a completion finishes in parallel. If you'd like to maintain the order of your completions, pass in the `keep_order` boolean as `True`.- **Prompt Engineering Examples**: Get started quickly with included examples of prompt engineering techniques.- **Python Typing Support**: Enjoy the benefits of Python's dynamic typing system while using OpenAI API.## InstallationYou can install aitemplates directly from PyPI:```bashpip install aitemplates```To get the latest version of the package, you can also clone the repository and install the package by running `pip install -e .` in the repository directory.## Creating Jupyter Notebook TemplatesCreate Jupyter notebook templates for prompt engineering with the following command:```bashaitemplates name_of_notebook```Include a Chroma database in the template with the `-db` flag:```bashaitemplates name_of_notebook -db```For asynchronous chat completions, add the `-asnc` flag:```bashaitemplates name_of_notebook -db -asnc```For chat completions with function boilerplate add the `-func` flag (async do not support functions):```bashaitemplates name_of_notebook -db -func```## DocumentationThe package includes example notebooks, which provide comprehensive guides and demonstrations of the functionalities provided by aitemplates. To access these notebooks, access or clone the repository at [https://github.com/SilenNaihin/ai_templates](https://github.com/SilenNaihin/ai_templates) and navigate to the `/notebooks` directory.Here are the available notebooks:- `oai_examples.ipynb`: Provides examples for the OpenAI API including functions.- `chroma_examples.ipynb`: Demonstrates usage of ChromaDB.- `prompt_engineering_example.ipynb`: A comprehensive guide on prompt engineering, including various techniques, usage of ChromaDB and the OpenAI library together.## Requirements- Be sure to have a `.env` file with the `OPENAI_API_KEY` defined in the root of your project or your api key defined in some way for OpenAI. AWS env variables are for ChromaDB deployment https://docs.trychroma.com/deployment- This library doesn't currently support text models like `text-davinci-003`. Streaming and logit_bias parameters are also not supported## ContributingI welcome and appreciate contributions to aitemplates. If you'd like to contribute a feature, please submit a pull request. For bugs, please open a new issue, and I'll address it promptly.## Future?- https://twitter.com/ItakGol/status/1668336193270865921- Support for other LLMs- Support for other dbs</longdescription>

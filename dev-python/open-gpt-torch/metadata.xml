It is designed to simplify the deployment and management of large language models, on a distributed cluster of GPUs.We aim to make it a one-stop solution for a centralized and accessible place to gather techniques for optimizing large-scale multimodal models and make them easy to use for everyone.## Table of contents- [Features](#features)- [Supported models](#supported-models)- [Get started](#get-started)- [Build a model serving in one line](#build-a-model-serving-in-one-line)- [Cloud-native deployment](#cloud-native-deployment)- [Roadmap](#roadmap)## FeaturesOpenGPT provides the following features to make it easy to deploy and serve **large multi-modal models** (LMMs) at scale:- Support for multi-modal models on top of large language models- Scalable architecture for handling high traffic loads- Optimized for low-latency inference- Automatic model partitioning and distribution across multiple GPUs- Centralized model management and monitoring- REST API for easy integration with existing applications## Updates- **2023-05-12**: 🎉We have released the first version `v0.0.1` of OpenGPT. You can install it with `pip install open_gpt_torch`.## Supported Models&lt;details&gt;OpenGPT supports the following models out of the box:- LLM (Large Language Model)  - [LLaMA](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/): open and efficient foundation language models by Meta  - [Pythia](https://github.com/EleutherAI/pythia): a collection of models developed to facilitate interpretability research by EleutherAI  - [StableLM](https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableLM): series of large language models by Stability AI  - [Vicuna](https://vicuna.lmsys.org/): a chat assistant fine-tuned from LLaMA on user-shared conversations by LMSYS  - [MOSS](https://txsun1997.github.io/blogs/moss.html): conversational language model from Fudan University- LMM (Large Multi-modal Model)  - [OpenFlamingo](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_flamingo): an open source version of DeepMind's [Flamingo](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/tackling-multiple-tasks-with-a-single-visual-language-model) model  - [MiniGPT-4](https://minigpt-4.github.io/): aligns a frozen visual encoder with a frozen LLM, Vicuna, using just one projection layer. For more details about the supported models, please see the [Model Zoo](./MODEL_ZOO.md).&lt;/details&gt;## RoadmapYou can view our roadmap with features that are planned, started, and completed on the [Roadmap discussion](https://github.com/jina-ai/opengpt/discussions/categories/roadmap) category.## Get Started### InstallationInstall the package with `pip`:```bashpip install open_gpt_torch```### Quickstart```pythonimport open_gptmodel = open_gpt.create_model(    'stabilityai/stablelm-tuned-alpha-3b', device='cuda', precision='fp16')prompt = &quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.&quot;output = model.generate(    prompt,    max_length=100,    temperature=0.9,    top_k=50,    top_p=0.95,    repetition_penalty=1.2,    do_sample=True,    num_return_sequences=1,)```We use the [stabilityai/stablelm-tuned-alpha-3b](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stablelm-tuned-alpha-3b) as the open example model as it is relatively small and fast to download.&gt; **Warning**&gt; In the above example, we use `precision='fp16'` to reduce the memory usage and speed up the inference with some loss in accuracy on text generation tasks. &gt; You can also use `precision='fp32'` instead as you like for better performance. &gt; **Note**&gt; It usually takes a while (several minutes) for the first time to download and load the model into the memory.In most cases of large model serving, the model cannot fit into a single GPU. To solve this problem, we also provide a `device_map` option (supported by `accecleate` package) to automatically partition the model and distribute it across multiple GPUs:```pythonmodel = open_gpt.create_model(    'stabilityai/stablelm-tuned-alpha-3b', precision='fp16', device_map='balanced')```In the above example, `device_map=&quot;balanced&quot;` evenly split the model on all available GPUs, making it possible for you to serve large models.&gt; **Note**&gt; The `device_map` option is supported by the [accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate) package. See [examples on how to use opengpt with different models.](./examples) 🔥## Build a model serving in one lineTo do so, you can use the `serve` command:```bashopengpt serve stabilityai/stablelm-tuned-alpha-3b --precision fp16 --device_map balanced```💡 **Tip**: you can inspect the available options with `opengpt serve --help`.This will start a gRPC and HTTP server listening on port `51000` and `52000` respectively. Once the server is ready, as shown below:&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Click to expand&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jina-ai/opengpt/blob/main/.github/images/serve_ready.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;&lt;/details&gt;You can then send requests to the server:```pythonimport requestsprompt = &quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.&quot;response = requests.post(    &quot;http://localhost:51000/generate&quot;,    json={        &quot;prompt&quot;: prompt,        &quot;max_length&quot;: 100,        &quot;temperature&quot;: 0.9,        &quot;top_k&quot;: 50,        &quot;top_p&quot;: 0.95,        &quot;repetition_penalty&quot;: 1.2,        &quot;do_sample&quot;: True,        &quot;num_return_sequences&quot;: 1,    },)```What's more, we also provide a [Python client](https://github.com/jina-ai/inference-client/) (`inference-client`) for you to easily interact with the server:```pythonfrom open_gpt import Clientclient = Client()# connect to the model servermodel = client.get_model(endpoint='grpc://0.0.0.0:51000')prompt = &quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.&quot;output = model.generate(    prompt,    max_length=100,    temperature=0.9,    top_k=50,    top_p=0.95,    repetition_penalty=1.2,    do_sample=True,    num_return_sequences=1,)```💡 **Tip**: To display the list of available commands, please use the `list` command.## Cloud-native deploymentYou can also deploy the server to a cloud provider like Jina Cloud or AWS.To do so, you can use `deploy` command:### Jina Cloudusing predefined executor```bashopengpt deploy stabilityai/stablelm-tuned-alpha-3b --precision fp16 --device_map balanced --cloud jina --replicas 1```It will give you a HTTP url and a gRPC url by default:```bashhttps://{random-host-name}-http.wolf.jina.aigrpcs://{random-host-name}-grpc.wolf.jina.ai```### AWSTBD## ContributingWe welcome contributions from the community!

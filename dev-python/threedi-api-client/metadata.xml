A warning will be emitted if the old one is used (openapi_client).- The API version should now be omitted from the API_HOST setting (e.g.  https://api.3di.live instead of https://api.3di.live/v3.0). A warning will be emitted if  a version is included.- Make V3AlphaApi a subclass of V3BetaApi, and V3BetaApi a superset of V3Api.- Added a ``retries`` to the ``ThreediApi`` which enables setting a retry policy.  For the async client, ``aiohttp_retry`` is included.- Changed the default ``timeout`` of asynchronous file down/upload from 5 minutes total to  only socket timeouts of 5 seconds. This allows upload of larger files.- Changed the default socket read ``timeout`` of uploads from 5 seconds to 10 minutes  to accomodate large file uploads.3.0.29 (2021-06-02)-------------------- Moved documentation to readthedocs and consistently named the project from  threedi-api-client (instead of threedi-openapi-client).3.0.28 (2021-05-04)-------------------- Renamed general settings to physical settings.3.0.27 (2021-04-26)-------------------- Dropped support for Python 3.5.- Added upload and download file functions (sync and async).3.0.26 (2021-04-07)-------------------- Put leakage back.

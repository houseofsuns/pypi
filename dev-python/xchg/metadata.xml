Key features:- Very minimalistic (300 lines in code), written in a functional style;- You can download a sample data from poloniex.com or provide your data in .csv files;- You can set an initial balance, use basic functions like buy, sell, go to the next time step;- More advanced features like a total capital calculation, and make portfolio, more about that at the link below;- Trading fees and minimum order amounts are supported.**Full API documentation is here: https://sergei-bondarenko.github.io/xchg/**## Quick startThe package is available on [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/xchg/), so you can install it via pip:```bashpip install xchg```Then we need a market data. For tutorial purposes you can download it with this command which will be available after package installation:```bashdownload_candles```It will download 50 candles for ETC, ETH, LTC and XMR cryptocurrencies from [poloniex.com](https://poloniex.com/) exchange and put it in `sample_data/` directory in the current path. Or you can download `sample_data/` directory from this repository.Later you can view these .csv files and use your own data in the same format. You can have a different number of currecies, and different set of columns. The only mandatory column is &quot;close&quot; price, as it will used for trading. Just ensure that you have the same time range for different currencies and have no gaps in data.Prices in .csv files are expressed in a base currency, which will be called __cash__ (if you are curious, in the sample data cash currency is BTC).Now let's trade!```python3from xchg import Xchg# Set an initial balance. Let's set that we have only cash currency at the# start.balance = {'cash': 100, 'ETC': 0, 'ETH': 0, 'LTC': 0, 'XMR': 0}# Set a trading fee which will be paid for each buy or sell trade (in this# example it's 1%). You can set 0 if you don't want any fee to be paid.fee = 0.01# Set a minimum order size expressed in a cash currency. You can not place# orders less than that value. You can use also set 0 here if you don't# want to limit a minimum order size.min_order_size = 0.001# Create an exchange.ex = Xchg(fee, min_order_size, data_path='sample_data/', balance=balance)# Let's buy some coins.ex = ex.buy('ETC', 7500)ex = ex.buy('LTC', 15000)print(ex.balance)# Output: {'cash': 2.2024749999999926, 'ETC': 7425.0, 'ETH': 0.0, 'LTC': 14850.0, 'XMR': 0.0}# All done, now we want to wait for 30 time periods.for _ in range(30):  ex = ex.next_step()# Now we want to sell.ex = ex.sell('ETC', 7425)ex = ex.sell('LTC', 14850)print(ex.balance)# Output: {'cash': 101.1232084225, 'ETC': 0.0, 'ETH': 0.0, 'LTC': 0.0, 'XMR': 0.0}# We made more than 1 BTC profit, yay!```## For developersInstall testing modules:```bashpip install pytest pytest-flake8 pytest-cov```Use the following command to run tests locally:```python3pytest --flake8 --cov=xchg --cov-report term-missing -vvv```And do not forget to increase a version in `xchg/__init__.py` before commiting.</longdescription>

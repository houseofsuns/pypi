All existing Lifetimes functionality is supported, and Bayesian [PyMC](https://github.com/pymc-devs) model implementations are now in Beta.## IntroductionBTYD can be used to analyze your users based on the following assumptions:1. Users interact with you when they are active, or &quot;alive&quot;2. Users under study may &quot;die&quot; or become inactive after some period of timeIf this is too abstract, consider these applications: - Predicting how often a visitor will return to your website. (Alive = visiting. Die = decided the website wasn't for them) - Understanding how frequently a patient may return to a hospital. (Alive = visiting. Die = maybe the patient moved to a new city, or became deceased.) - Predicting individuals who have churned from an app using only their usage history. (Alive = logins. Die = removed the app) - Predicting repeat purchases from a customer. (Alive = actively purchasing. Die = became disinterested with your product) - Predicting the lifetime value of your customers## InstallationBTYD installation requires Python 3.8 or 3.9:```bashpip install btyd```## ContributingPlease refer to the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/ColtAllen/btyd/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before creating any *Pull Requests*.## Documentation and Tutorials[User Guide](https://btyd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/User%20Guide.html)## Questions?

R implementation is called [BTYDplus](https://github.com/mplatzer/BTYDplus).1. [Bruce Hardie's website](http://brucehardie.com/), especially his notes, is full of useful and essential explanations, many of which are featured in this library.</longdescription>

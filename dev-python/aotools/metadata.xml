To be able to use the tools from anywhere on your system,add the ``aotools`` directory to your ``PYTHONTPATH``.Alternatively you can use one of the methods below.Anaconda++++++++AOtools can be installed in an anaconda environment using:.. code-block:: python   conda install -c aotools aotoolsPip+++AOtools can be installed using pip:.. code-block:: python    pip install aotools(which may require admin or root privileges)From Source+++++++++++Alternatively, to install the tools to your system python distribution from source, run:.. code-block:: python    python setup.py install(which may require admin or root privileges) from the ``aotools`` directory.Documentation+++++++++++++Full documentation is hosted by  `Read the Docs &lt;https://aotools.readthedocs.io/en/v1.0.1/&gt;`_Issues and Contributions++++++++++++++++++++++++Have you found a problem with an AO Tool? Is there something you use often that you think should be included?Please have a quick look at the source code and see if you can fix the problem or make an addition.AOtools is a collaboration between many AO scientists across the world to try and make a well tested and reliable library of AO based functions. There isn't neccessarily a central &quot;developer&quot; to make significant changes, therefore if you think you can help then please get involved, make an issue, clone the code or make a pull request! Feel free to make an issue for discussion.Usage Stats-----------Pip+++.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json.svg?color=bright%20green&amp;label=Downloads%2FMonth&amp;query=%24.data.last_month&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpypistats.org%2Fapi%2Fpackages%2Faotools%2Frecent   :target: https://pypistats.org/packages/aotools   Anaconda++++++++.. image:: https://anaconda.org/aotools/aotools/badges/downloads.svg   :target: https://anaconda.org/aotools/aotools</longdescription>

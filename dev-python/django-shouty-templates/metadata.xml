	<longdescription>django-shouty-templates=======================:author: Keryn Knight:version: 0.2.0Brief-----This app applies a monkeypatch which forces Django's template language to error**very loudly** about variables which are *used* in a template but *don't exist* in the context.Rationale---------Given a template like this::    &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;    &lt;body&gt;    {% if chef.can_add_cakes %}        &lt;label class=&quot;alert alert-{{ chef.is_cake_chef|yesno:&quot;success,danger,default&quot; }}    {% endif %}everything works fine, until you refactor and any of the following happens:- ``chef`` is no longer the name of the variable.- ``can_add_cakes`` is refactored to be called ``can_add_pastries``- ``is_cake_chef`` is renamed ``is_pastry_king``If those happen, the template will either silently display nothing, or willdisplay the label incorrectly. This monkeypatch attempts to fix that.Specifically:- ``chef`` will raise an exception if the variable were called ``sous_chef``- ``chef.can_add_cakes`` will raise an exception if ``can_add_cakes`` was no longer a valid attribute/property/method of ``chef``- ``chef.is_cake_chef`` will raise an exception for the same reasons.Thus you can refactor somewhat more freely, knowing that if the template rendersit's OK. It ain't compile time safety, but it's better than silently swallowingerrors because you forgot something!The exception itself would look something like::    Token 'chef' of 'chef.can_add_cakes' in template 'my/cool/template.html' does not resolve.    Possibly you meant to use 'sous_chef'.    Silence this occurance only by adding 'chef.can_add_cakes': ['my/cool/template.html'] to the settings.SHOUTY_VARIABLE_BLACKLIST dictionary.    Silence this globally by adding 'chef.can_add_cakes': ['*'] to the settings.SHOUTY_VARIABLE_BLACKLIST dictionary.Setup-----This package is available on `PyPI`_ and can be installed using pip or whatever like so::    pip install django-shouty-templates==0.2.0Then add ``shouty.Shout`` or ``shouty`` to your ``settings.INSTALLED_APPS``Optional configuration^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^A list of values which may be set in your project's settings module:settings.SHOUTY_VARIABLES+++++++++++++++++++++++++May be ``True|False`` and determines if the exception is raised when trying touse a variable which doesn't exist.Defaults to ``True``.settings.SHOUTY_URLS++++++++++++++++++++May be ``True|False`` and determines if an exception is raised whendoing ``{% url 'myurl' as my_var %}`` and ``myurl`` doesn't actually resolve to a view.Defaults to ``True``.settings.SHOUTY_VARIABLE_BLACKLIST++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Useful for if you are trying to fix up an existing project, or ignore problemsin third-party templates.Expects a ``dict`` of ``str`` keys and a sequence (eg: ``tuple`` or ``list``) of templates in which to ignore it::    SHOUTY_VARIABLE_BLACKLIST = {        &quot;chef.can_add_cakes&quot;: (&quot;*&quot;,),        &quot;my_sometimes_set_variable&quot;: [&quot;admin/custom_view.html&quot;, &quot;admin/custom_view_detail.html&quot;],        &quot;random_in_memory_template&quot;: [&quot;&lt;unknown source&gt;&quot;],        &quot;*&quot;: [&quot;admin/login.html&quot;, &quot;&lt;unknown source&gt;&quot;],    }Of special note is the use of ``*``, which has a more magical meaning.- Using ``&quot;key&quot;: [&quot;*&quot;]`` would silence errors about the variable named ``key`` in **all templates**- Using ``&quot;*&quot;: [&quot;path/to/template.html&quot;]`` would silence **all** variable errors in **that specific template** only (see `GitHub issue 6`_)And also the far less frequently useful ``&lt;unknown source&gt;`` or ``django.template.base.UNKNOWN_SOURCE`` which is essentially usually for ``Template`` instancesnot loaded from a *file on disk*settings.SHOUTY_URL_BLACKLIST+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++A ``tuple`` of ``2-tuple`` to prevent certain URLs and their output variables from shouting at you loudly. Useful for existing projects or third-party apps which are less strict.By way of example, ``{% url &quot;myurl&quot; as my_var %}`` may be suppressed with::    SHOUTY_URL_BLACKLIST = (        ('myurl', 'my_var'),    )which would still let ``{% url &quot;myurl&quot; as &quot;my_other_var&quot; %}`` raise an exception.Default configuration^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^There's a hard-coded blacklist of variables and URLs to make sure the Django admin (+ admindocs),django-debug-toolbar, django-pipeline, django-admin-honeypot, djangorestframework, etc all work.if/elif/else testing--------------------When an ``{% if x %}`` statement is seen in the template, all conditions are checkedto ensure the context will always resolve correctly. Additionally, if you use ``{% if %}``and ``{% elif %}`` together and **don't** have an ``{% else %}`` it'll raise an errorto remind you to handle that case, even if handling it is just to output nothing.Tests-----Just run ``python3 -m shouty`` and hope for the best. I usually do.The license-----------It's `FreeBSD`_.

The exception message and functionality remain the same.* Feature: exception messages now attempt to clarify what template name (loader relative) was rendering when the missing variable was encountered.* Chore: Updated the ``mypy`` type signatures for some of the variables and methods to indicate the only values I'm expecting to accept.0.1.3^^^^^^* Feature: Silenced errors when using ``debug`` or ``sql_queries`` in a template, as they're conditionally set by ``django.template.context_processors.debug``0.1.2^^^^^^* Feature: Added 11 new tokens to the default blacklist, covering more of the default Django admin and the default exception reporter.* Bugfix: Changed the syntax of the ``AppConfig.ready`` method to be py2 type annotation compatible.0.1.1^^^^^^* Initial release</longdescription>

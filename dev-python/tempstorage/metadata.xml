	<longdescription>Overview========A storage implementation which uses RAM to persist objects, much likeMappingStorage. Unlike MappingStorage, it needs not be packed to get rid ofnon-cyclic garbage and it does rudimentary conflict resolution. This is aripoff of Jim's Packless bsddb3 storage.Changelog=========6.0 (2023-03-24)----------------- Add support for Python 3.10, 3.11.- Drop support for Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6.5.2 (2021-07-05)----------------- Update package configuration- Package is now officially undeprecated because the data corruption issue -  that was the reason for its deprecation - has been understood and fixed.

	<longdescription># Multi-Client Reporting Utility for OpsRamp  ## PurposeThis is a utility intended for use by OpsRamp customers needing to batch-generate some useful reports across all tenants in their partner instance.## First time executionThe first time it is run, it will look to see if the default environment config directory exists, and if it's not there it will create it.After that, you can either update the environments.yml file in the environment config directory with your partner-level OpsRamp API credentials, or you can specify API credentials on the command line.## Available ReportsThe following reports are currently available.  Each report generates a separate report file for each tenant unless ptherwise specified:### Server Utilization ComparisonThis report contains a page for each Windows or Linux server in the environment, with time-series graphs for the speficied period for CPU Utilization, File System Utilization, and Memory Utilization.  A table at the bottom of each page shows min, max, and average for the current period and increase/decrease trend from the baseline period.### Network UtilizationThis is a fairly standard Top N report for Cisco device CPU Utilization, Memory Utilization, and Interface Utilization, Errors, etc.  It shows a time series only for the Top N items, followed by a detail report of all items sorted from highest to lowest.### Patch ManagementSummary of patches installed in the reporting period in pdf format### Remote Control UsageHistogram and detailed list of remote control console sessions that occurred in the reporting period.### Hardware InventoryThis provides a list of resources in either excel (default) or pdf format### Software InventoryThis provides a list of installed applications and services for each device in pdf format## Command line help:    usage: opreport [-h] [--env ENV] [--envfile ENVFILE] [--api_url API_URL] [--key KEY] [--secret SECRET] [--tenant TENANT] [--start START] [--end END]                    [--outdir OUTDIR] [--logo LOGO] [--secure SECURE] [--tenant_criteria TENANT_CRITERIA]                    {uc,nu,pm,rcu,hi,si} ...

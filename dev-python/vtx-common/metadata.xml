	<longdescription>===================Vertex Common Tools===================A collection of a few common tools which are useful for Python packaging and CI purposes.These tools can be invoked as Python modules from the Python command line (``python -m &lt;module path&gt;``). Available toolsinclude the following:``vtx_common.tools.github_release``    This can be used to automatically push a Release up to github using a changelog file. Many values may automatically    be resolved from environment variables. Some values may also come from ``setup.cfg`` files. The following config    values are read from that location (under the section ``vtx_common:github_release``):    ``release-name``        Name to prefix the release as.    ``extra-lines``        Additional lines appended to the changelog. This setting may only be set via ``setup.cfg``.    ``remove-urls``        Boolean to remove lines starting as RST URL links from changelog lines.    ``dry-run``        Do a dry run. Still requires a tag to be parsable from a environment variable.    ``changelog``        The changelog file to parse.``vtx_common.tools.pep8_staged_files``    Runs ``autopep8`` against the repository. Must be run from the root of the repository. Can use the following Bash    alias to make this easier to invoke::        alias pep8staged='python -m vtx_common.tools.pep8_staged_files'``vtx_common.tools.pre_commit``    This is used as a Git pre-commit hook. This can be easily installed via the following command::        echo &quot;python -m vtx_common.tools.pre_commit&quot; &gt; .git/hooks/pre-commit &amp;&amp; chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit    This will run ``pycodestyle`` against Python files to be committed. It assumes that there is a ``setup.cfg`` file    in the root directory of the repo.``vtx_common.tools.buildpkg``    This will execute rstorm files for a given storm package file following Vertex conventions, in order to generate    markdown documentation for the package that can be viewed in the Synapse UI. This requires having the Synapse    python package available, as well as ``pandoc``. Pandoc should be ve`rs`ion ``2.14.0.1`` or greater.This package also installs ``bump2version``, ``pytest``, ``pytest-cov`` and ``pytest-xdist`` packages.</longdescription>

It works the best when 2-5 words describe some wider concepts, examples:  - &quot;NASDAQ technology index&quot;  - &quot;Airline travel demand&quot;  - &quot;Energy disruptions in Europe&quot;- Such queries will include related concept  - for &quot;NASDAQ technology index&quot; it might also consider terms as &quot;Dow Jones&quot;, &quot;FAANG&quot;, &quot;FTSE&quot; etc.  - exact structure depends mostly on how topics co-occur together  - intuition behind is that NASDAQ is US tech stock index, but if data contains strong signals from FTSE, a British blue chip index, or Dow Jones, less tech heavy index, this will also have an impact on query of interest  - to reflect changing world situation, underlying models are constantly re-trained making sure relations are up-to-date```pythonfrom adase_api import querysearch_topics = &quot;inflation rates, OPEC cartel&quot;ada_query = QuerySentimentAPI(    many_query=search_topics,        engine='topic',         process_cfg=ProcessConfig(roll_period='28d', freq='-1d', z_score=True),    credentials=credentials,    run_async=False)sentiment = load_sentiment(ada_query)sentiment.unstack(2).tail(10)``````textquery                      inflation rates                      OPEC cartel                                                       coverage       hits     score    coverage       hits     scoredate_time           source                                                                      2022-05-26 07:00:00 media         0.002947   6.220238 -0.059335    0.001945   5.619048 -0.034639                    social        0.008054  50.779762  0.023118    0.003774  29.595238  0.0221362022-05-26 08:00:00 avg           0.004778  24.073413  0.002614    0.002553  15.003968  0.007849                    corp          0.000297   0.565476  0.054003    0.000384   0.761905  0.050364                    media         0.002935   6.172619 -0.060830    0.001940   5.595238 -0.034008                    social        0.008023  50.416667  0.024123    0.003775  29.482143  0.0208682022-05-26 09:00:00 avg           0.004770  23.942460  0.004983    0.002540  14.908730  0.009729                    corp          0.000297   0.565476  0.054003    0.000384   0.761905  0.050364                    media         0.002950   6.125000 -0.057586    0.001922   5.523810 -0.028692                    social        0.007991  50.202381  0.025980    0.003767  29.363095  0.019497```it's visible data feed comes detailed per source type: - `media` indicates newspapers, TV, radio and other mass media- `social` includes social platforms and blogs- `corp` covers corporate communication as company newsrooms and regulatory filings- `avg` is a weighted average of all### API rate limitAll endpoints have set limit on API calls per minute, by default 10 calls  / min.### In case you don't have yet the credentials, you can [sign up for free](https://adalytica.io/signup)- Data available since January 1, 2006- Easy way to explore or backtest- In a trial version data lags 24-hours- Probably something else?

	<longdescription># riskThis project is the python *plug and play* implementation of the game [risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game)).## TC1 (reached)We have reached TC1 when:- we have created a general structure for the game (folder structure, packages, deployment) (reached)- we have defined the observation space (reached)- we have defined the action space (reached)## TC2 (reached)We have reached TC2 when:- We have implemented Version 1 ([v1](./versions.md)) (reached)## TC3 (due date 21-12-2018)We have reached TC3 when:- We have assigned an executor to each of the following bullet points- We have moved `humain.py` to the environment (there is a `human mode` for that)- We are able to load and store graphs (either through own implementation or via the [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/overview.html) library)- We have enhanced code readability (refactor classes and functions to be understood more easily)- We have documented the written code (correlates with the point above)- We have implemented Version 2 ([v2](./versions.md))## TC4 (due date 22-03-2019)We have reached TC4 when:- We have implemented the actual risk map as our graph- We have implemented the troop deployement- We have playermoves consisting of seperate stages- We have added Tests for our main features## TC5 (due date xx-xx-2019)We have reached TC5 when:- We have implemented the random card reward for a won country## TC6 (due date xx-xx-2019)We have reached TC6 when:- We have implemented the random dice roll to determine the outcome of a fight</longdescription>

	<longdescription>Microsoft Azure CLI Dev Tools (azdev)=====================================The ``azdev`` tool is designed to aid new and experienced developers in contributing to Azure CLI command modules and extensions.Setting up your development environment+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++1. Install Python 3.6+ from http://python.org. Please note that the version of Python that comes preinstalled on OSX is 2.7.2. Fork and clone the repository or repositories you wish to develop for.    - For Azure CLI: https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli    - For Azure CLI Extensions: https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli-extensions    - Any other repository that you might have access to that contains CLI extensions.3. Create a new virtual environment for Python in the root of your clone. You can do this by running:    Python 3.6+ (all platforms):    ::        python -m venv env    or:    ::        python3 -m venv env4. Activate the env virtual environment by running:    Windows CMD.exe:    ::        env\scripts\activate.bat    Windows Powershell:    ::        env\scripts\activate.ps1    OSX/Linux (bash):    ::        source env/bin/activate5. Install ``azdev`` by running:    ::        pip install azdev6. Complete setup by running:    ::        azdev setup    This will launch the interactive setup process. To see non-interactive options run `azdev setup -h`.Reporting issues and feedback+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++If you encounter any bugs with the tool please file an issue in the `Issues &lt;https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli-dev-tools/issues&gt;`__ section of our GitHub repo.Contribute Code+++++++++++++++This project has adopted the `Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct &lt;https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/&gt;`__.For more information see the `Code of Conduct FAQ &lt;https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/&gt;`__ or contact `opencode@microsoft.com &lt;mailto:opencode@microsoft.com&gt;`__ with any additional questions or comments.If you would like to become an active contributor to this project pleasefollow the instructions provided in `Microsoft Azure Projects Contribution Guidelines &lt;http://azure.github.io/guidelines.html&gt;`__.License+++++++::    Azure CLI Dev Tools (azdev)    Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation    All rights reserved.

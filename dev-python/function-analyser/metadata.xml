	<longdescription># function-analyserTL;DR;```commandlinepip install function-analyser```There is much debate about the ideal length of a function or method.E.g.```The first rule of functions is that they should be small.The second rule of functions is that they should be smaller than that.Functions should not be 100 lines long.Functions should hardly ever be 20 lines long.```Robert (Bob) Martin, Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship (2008)as cited in https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/133404/what-is-the-ideal-length-of-a-method-for-youCommon sense, therefore, offers one solution.However, I have taken a different approach in runninganalysis on many codebases and using this to calibratea functional analysis tool to run on your *own* codebase.The results are encapsulated in this useful function analysistool.</longdescription>

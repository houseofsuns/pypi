Do not prompt for credentials    --user USER           The user to log in as.    --password PASSWORD   Password of the user.    --blacklist BLACKLIST                            Packages matched by this requirements.txt style file                            will never be build.    --pure-index PURE_INDEX                            The index to use for pure packages. Any non-pure                            package will be uploaded to the index given as                            positional argument. Packages already found in the                            pure index will not be built, either.    --junit-xml JUNIT_XML                            Write information about the build success / failure to                            a JUnit-compatible XML file.    --run-id RUN_ID       Add the given string to all entries in the XML output,                            allowing to distinguish output from multiple runs in a                            merged XML.    --dry-run             Build missing wheels, but do not modify the state of                            the devpi server.    --client-cert CLIENT_CERT                            Client key to use to authenticate with the devpi                            server.The following environment variables can be used instead of command line arguments:``DEVPI_USER``    The value of this environment variable will be used if ``--user`` is not given.``DEVPI_PASSWORD``    The value of this environment variable will be used if ``--password`` is not given.Features========* Read a ``requirements.txt`` style input file.* Read user/pass from the environment (using ``DEVPI_USER`` and ``DEVPI_PASSWORD``).* Support multiple versions of a package in the same file.* Only build packages not yet in the target index.* Support a black-list for packages to never be built and uploaded (certain packages like numpy are fragile regarding their interdependency with other packages).* Can use separate indices for plain python packages and those with binary contents.* Can log build results to a JUnit compatible XML file, thus that it can be parsed by Jenkins.License=======`New BSD`_.. _devpi: http://doc.devpi.net/latest/.. _New BSD: https://github.com/blue-yonder/devpi-builder/blob/master/COPYING=========Changelog=========This lists the most important changes for each release.Version 6.1.0 — 2023-09-22==========================Added-----* Support using VCS URLs in requirements files.Fixed-----* Building wheels for packages like ``zope-event`` that normalise the project name using dots instead of underscores is no longer broken.Version 6.0.0 — 2023-06-09==========================Added-----* Python 3.10 and 3.11 are now supported.Changed-------* Improved performance of checking for already built packages.Removed-------* Dropped support for running tests via `setup.py test`.  The mechanism is considered deprecated by upstream and removing it allows us to drop a dependency.* Python 3.6 is no longer supported. It likely still works but we will no longer run CI against it.Version 5.1.0 — 2021-11-05==========================Added-----* Provide compatibility with pip 21.3 and above which drops the `--build-directory` option.  Pip has been using a temporary directory for builds since version 1.2 so manual handling of this directory should not be necessary anymore.Version 5.0.1 – 2020-09-09==========================Fixed-----* Adhere to case-insensivity when comparing package names.  This will lead to blacklisting 'cython' vs. 'Cython' being the same thing.Version 5.0.0 – 2020-04-24==========================Fixed-----* Remove dependency on the internal ``wheel`` API.  This blocked the use of ``wheel`` versions &gt;= 0.32.Removed-------* Python 2 is no longer supported.* Python 3.5 is no longer supported.Version 4.0.0 – 2018-11-02==========================Fixed-----* Correctly specify the dependency to Wheel to avoid the latest, incompatible versions.Removed-------* Python 3.3 and Python 3.4 are no longer supported.Version 3.0.1 — 2017-11-21==========================Fixed-----* Properly handle non-ASCII characters in the output of failed package builds. Previous versions used to crash in this  case if a JUnit XML output file was requested.Version 3.0.0 — 2017-06-16==========================Added-----* The command line parameter ``--batch`` can be used to disable any prompts.Changed-------* The way credentials are passed has been changed in an incompatible way.  The positional arguments for user and password no longer exist.  Instead, use one of the following:  - Pass the credentials via ``--user`` and ``--password`` command line arguments.  - Pass the credentials via the environment variables ``DEVPI_USER`` and ``DEVPI_PASSWORD``.  - Answer the interactive prompt for user and password. This is only possible if ``--batch`` is not used.Version 2.3.1 — 2017-05-19==========================Changed-------* Improved performance if a blacklist is used.Version 2.3.0 — 2017-04-07==========================Added-----* The command line parameter ``--run-id`` allows to specify a run identifier that will be added to each entry in the  generated JUnit XML.Changed-------* Changelog is now in the format suggested by Keep-a-CHANGELOG_.Version 2.2.0 — 2016-05-23==========================Added-----* Capture build errors for better output in case of build failures. Thanks Travis Mehlinger.Version 2.1.0 — 2016-04-22==========================Added-----* Support for client certificates. Thanks Hans Lawrenz.Version 2.0.0 — 2016-01-20==========================Added-----* Compatibility with pip &gt;= 8.0 by relying on pip's default download cache  mechanism instead of explicitly requiring a download cache. This effectively  disables caching for people still using pip &lt; 6.0.  Thanks Christian Stefanescu.* Support for dry-running the wheel build without changing the devpi server state.* Python 3.5 is now officially supported.Removed-------* Python 3.2 is no longer supported.Version 1.0.0 — 2015-05-22==========================Changed-------- Use devpi-plumber_ instead of a custom devpi wrapper.- Check the blacklist first when deciding whether to build a package.Version 0.4.0 — 2015-09-13==========================Changed-------* Only consider a package to exist if it is a wheel and it is compatible with  the current system. Thanks Michael Still and David SzottenFixed-----* The source distribution now properly contains a README.md.  Thanks Mikhail Lukyanchenko.Version 0.3.0 — 2015-08-15==========================Added-----* Support for special-case handling of pure python wheels* Optional support for reporting skipped packages in a JUnit-compatible XML* Python 3 supportVersion 0.2.1 — 2014-08-07==========================Fixed-----* Fixed crash if a built wheel could cannot be found  (because pip&lt;=1.5.2 skipped it).Version 0.2.0 — 2014-08-01==========================Added-----* Support for package blacklisting to never build certain wheels.Changed-------* build as many packages as possible. Do not stop if one fails.Version 0.1.0 — 2014-08-01==========================Added------ Build a list of packages and upload them to a Devpi index.. _devpi-plumber: https://github.com/blue-yonder/devpi-plumber.. _Keep-a-CHANGELOG: http://keepachangelog.com</longdescription>

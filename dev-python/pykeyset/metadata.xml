To install with `pip` run:    pip install pykeysetOr to install the latest source directly from GitHub, run:    git clone https://github.com/staticintlucas/pykeyset.git pykeyset    cd pykeyset    pip install .This project uses [Maturin] as its build system.To install this package locally for development, run:    maturin developTo build the source distribution and wheel run:    maturin build --releaseAdditionally, Linux releases should be compiled with `--manylinux 2014`[pypi]: https://pypi.org/project/pykeyset/[maturin]: https://github.com/PyO3/maturin## Contributing`pykeyset` uses [Black] and [isort] for formatting, and all code must pass [Flake8]'s checks.These are checked by GitHub on all pull requests.To run these tools automatically when committing, install the [pre-commit] hook in *[.pre-commit-config.yaml](.pre-commit-config.yaml)*.[black]: https://github.com/psf/black[isort]: https://pycqa.github.io/isort/[flake8]: https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/[pre-commit]: https://pre-commit.com/## LicenceThis project is licensed under either of* Apache License, Version 2.0 ([LICENCE-APACHE](LICENCE-APACHE) or [http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0][apache-licence])* MIT license ([LICENCE-MIT](LICENCE-MIT) or [http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT][mit-licence])at your option.Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion inthis project by you, as defined in the Apache-2.0 license, shall be dual licensed as above, withoutany additional terms or conditions.[apache-licence]: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0[mit-licence]: http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT</longdescription>

If you haven't yet setup API access for Universal Analytics, GA4, Search Console or Google Ads, follow [our instructions](setup_instruction.md) to get started.# Google Analytics API wrapper`client.py` defines the class `Client` which builds `googleapiclient.discovery` resources for accessing Google Search Console and Google Analytics 3 (UA) data from the respective APIs, and also `google.analytics.data_v1beta.BetaAnalyticsDataClient` resource for accessing GA4 data, although currently this is only for testing.Before using this python package you must [create a service account and download a JSON key file](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4/quickstart/service-py#1_enable_the_api)following the instructions from Google. This process will also give you a service account email address,you need to add this email address to the user list for the Analytics or Search Console account for which you want to obtain data — you only need to give the service account &quot;read&quot; access. A `Client` class can create a `GoogalyticsWrapper` object which has methods to access data the Google services and return a pandas dataframe. A typical implementation will look like:```pythonfrom pygoogalytics.client import Clientgoogalytics_client = Client(key_file_path='&lt;path-to-your-key-file&gt;')g_wrapper = googalytics_client.wrapper(  sc_domain='&lt;search-console-domain&gt;',   view_id='&lt;ga3-view-id&gt;',   ga4_property_id='&lt;ga4-property-id&gt;')ga3_dataframe = g_wrapper.get_df(  result='GA3',   start_date='2023-01-01',   end_date='2023-01-07',   metrics=['ga:itemRevenue', 'ga:itemQuantity', 'ga:users'],  dimensions=['ga:dateHourMinute', 'ga:landingPagePath', 'ga:sourceMedium', 'ga:countryIsoCode'])```The `get_df` method accepts the following values for the `result` argument:- &quot;GSC&quot;: for Google Search Console data- &quot;GA3&quot;: for Google Analytics 3 (UA) data- &quot;URL&quot;: for Google Search Console URL inspection data- &quot;GA4&quot;: for Google Analytics 4 data (note, this is not yet available in production)## Advantages of PyGoogalytics1. **Simple.** When doing SEO exploration using python we really want to use a Pandas dataframe. We can either download lots of CSV files separately then read them in, or we can use the API. The first is a little fiddly and canmean you're not getting the full picture: the GSC web app, for example, has a maximum number of rows you can downloadso you won't see all those long-tail case. The API option can be difficult to interpret for a beginner programmer and comes with its own caveats. PyGoogalytics is a user-friendly wrapper for the API that does GSC and GA3 in one, it returns a Pandas dataframe without any faff about pagination. Having a dataframe allows you to use all the familiar `sort_values`, `groupby`, etc. to analyse your data.2. **Compatible.** Pygoogalytics provides a child-class of Pandas (GooglePandas), which interprets the responses fromthe GSC and GA3 APIs. This also standardises column names (all snake_case) so that they match between GA and GSC. Italso converts the 2-character country ISO codes (e.g. 'US') used by GA3 into 3-character codes (e.g. 'USA') as used by GSC,to make it easy to join or merge the two. In this way you could get a dataframe for `country_iso_code`, `landing_page`,`ctr` and `position` from GSC, and another from GA3 with `country_iso_code`, `landing_page` and `transaction_revenue`,then join on the dimensions (`country_iso_code`, `landing_page`) to get a single data frame with data from both GA3 and GSC.3. **More metrics.** When using the API for GA3 (UA) data, you are allowed to request only 10 metrics at once. The PyGoogalytics wrapper allows the passing of any number of compatible dimensions and metrics:when more than ten metrics are passed, the list is partitioned into sub-lists of length 10and separate API calls are made for each partition, the resulting dataframes are then joined on the dimensions to create a seamless dataframe with all requested metrics.4. **More data.** When using the GSC or GA web applications, the data you can output is severely restricted, andrelies on downloading multiple CSV files. Going the API route is better for small sites, but both the Search Console and GA3 APIs can return a maximum of 100k rows of data, so even if you request one day's data at a time, you might run up to the limit for larger sites and have to paginate your requests. The PyGoogalytics wrapper automatically paginates the requests and concatenates the results to return a single dataframe of arbitrary length. ## Google Pandas`googlepandas.py` provides the classes `GADataFrame` and `GSCDataFrame`, both children of pandas `DataFrame` specific to storing GA and GSC data with additional metadata fields (e.g. `dimensions` and `metrics`) and methods for adding columns and filtering by particular metrics.</longdescription>

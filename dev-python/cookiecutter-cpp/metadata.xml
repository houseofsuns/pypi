This allows to easily add dependencies directly into the CMakeList.txt file.* No need to execute Conan_ commands (everything run with CMake).* Provide CLI11_ out-of-the-box (if requested).* Provide spdlog_ out-of-the-box (if requested).* Circleci_: Ready for Circleci Continuous Integration testing* hdoc_ documentation: TODO!* bump2version_: TODO!.. _Cookiecutter: https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutterQuickstart----------Install the latest Cookiecutter if you haven't installed it yet (this requiresCookiecutter 1.4.0 or higher)::    pip install -U cookiecutterGenerate a Python package project::    cookiecutter https://github.com/grhawk/cookiecutter-cpp.gitEnter the newly generated folder. Make sure the Conan_ profile is configured::    conan profile listIf you don't have a Conan_ profile, you can create one with `conan profile detect --force`.At this point you can run::    mkdir build &amp;&amp; cd build;    cmake ..    cmake --build .This will prepare the needed C++ libraries and compile the example code.You can now test the compiled code::    ./sandbox/cpp_boilerplate-sandboxand run the unittests::     ctestThe created folder is already a git repo that you can push on github and has already a basic CI implemented to testthe code with CircleCI.For more details, see the `cookiecutter-pypackage tutorial`_... _`cookiecutter-pypackage tutorial`: https://cookiecutter-pypackage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.htmlNot Exactly What You Want?--------------------------Don't worry, you have options:Fork This / Create Your Own~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~If you have differences in your preferred setup, I encourage you to fork thisto create your own version. Or create your own; it doesn't strictly have tobe a fork.* Once you have your own version working, add it to the Similar Cookiecutter  Templates list above with a brief description.* It's up to you whether or not to rename your fork/own version. Do whatever  you think sounds good.Contributing------------1. Fork the project.2. Edit whatever you feel like.3. Describe the changes on the &quot;unreleased&quot; tag in the CHANGELOG.md.4. Create a Merge Request to the `main` branch.Once a new branch has been merged, it is enough to create a new semver tag to generate a new version of the cookiecutter repo... _Circleci: http://circleci.com/.. _Tox: http://testrun.org/tox/.. _Doxigen: http://doxigen.org/.. _Read the Docs: https://readthedocs.io/.. _`pyup.io`: https://pyup.io/.. _bump2version: https://github.com/c4urself/bump2version.. _Punch: https://github.com/lgiordani/punch.. _Poetry: https://python-poetry.org/.. _PyPi: https://pypi.python.org/pypi.. _Mkdocs: https://pypi.org/project/mkdocs/.. _Conan: https://docs.conan.io/1/index.html.. _CMake-Conan-Integration: https://github.com/conan-io/cmake-conan.. _hdoc: https://hdoc.io/.. _CLI11: https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11.. _spdlog: https://github.com/gabime/spdlog.. _`Nekroze/cookiecutter-pypackage`: https://github.com/Nekroze/cookiecutter-pypackage.. _`tony/cookiecutter-pypackage-pythonic`: https://github.com/tony/cookiecutter-pypackage-pythonic.. _`ardydedase/cookiecutter-pypackage`: https://github.com/ardydedase/cookiecutter-pypackage.. _`lgiordani/cookiecutter-pypackage`: https://github.com/lgiordani/cookiecutter-pypackage.. _`briggySmalls/cookiecutter-pypackage`: https://github.com/briggySmalls/cookiecutter-pypackage.. _`veit/cookiecutter-namespace-template`: https://github.com/veit/cookiecutter-namespace-template.. _`zillionare/cookiecutter-pypackage`: https://zillionare.github.io/cookiecutter-pypackage/.. _github comparison view: https://github.com/tony/cookiecutter-pypackage-pythonic/compare/audreyr:master...master.. _`network`: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage/network.. _`family tree`: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage/network/members</longdescription>

And that's it! **pyattr** will handle the magic to make sure variables cannot be accessed / set where the shouldn't be. It also provides useful error messages to users.## ExampleHere is a simple example involving a *private* variable.```pythonfrom pyattr import Pyattrclass Example(Pyattr):    def __init__(self) -&gt; None:        super().__init__()        self.__name = &quot;pyattr&quot;example = Example()print(example.__name) # Error - '__name' is a private attribute of 'Example'.```As well as variables, **pyattr** also supports access control of *functions*!```pythonfrom pyattr import Pyattrclass Example(Pyattr):    def __init__(self) -&gt; None:        super().__init__()    def __example(self) -&gt; None:        passexample = Example()print(example.__example())  # Error - '__example' is a private attribute of 'Example'.```## How it works**pyattr** overrides the default *set* and *get* functions of your class. The overridden functions defined by **pyattr** are merged into your class when you inherit from the *`pyattr.Pyattr`* class. As well as this, the *`pyattr.Pyattr`* class inherits from the *`pyattr._PyattrDict`* class, which provides a custom dictionary implementation. This is because you can change the variables in a class using *`class.__dict__[&quot;var&quot;] = &quot;val&quot;`*, meaning a custom dictionary would be the best way to prevent the access system being circumvented.The overriden *set* and *get* functions of your class call the respective *set* and *get* functions of the custom dictionary. This dictionary, using *`sys._getframe()`*, works out the caller's function, and the caller's class (if any). It uses this data to work out if the caller should be allowed to access the specified variables. If it shouldn't, an *`AttributeError`* is raised, with an error message explaining the cause.## BenchmarksThe code for the benchmarks can be found in the [benchmark](https://github.com/skifli/pyattr/blob/main/benchmark/) folder.[![Benchmark Output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skifli/pyattr/main/benchmark/output.png)](https://github.com/skifli/pyattr/blob/main/benchmark/bench_test.py)</longdescription>

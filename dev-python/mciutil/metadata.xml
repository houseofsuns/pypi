I have learned a lot over the last 4 yearsand I now see the error in my ways.Some of the issues with this module that prompted me to rewrite it:* memory efficiency - loads entire file into memory for processing. Very ineffient and not very scalable* programming interface - mciutil did not consider the developer experience. You have to hack to use the logic elsewhere* dependencies - Too many third party modules, with ones that required a compilation. New version is compile free* bloat - I used a cookie cutter template when I started and it has stuff I don't like, value or use.* just mastercard - The old module was for mastercard only but I think it makes sense to have a library for all card utils* python 2 guff - mciutil works on py2 and 3. There is a lot of gunk in the code to make this work. We live in a py3 world now!The replacement module is cardutil - see https://cardutil.readthedocs.ioIt addresses all of the above issues.why not just update mciutil?----------------------------Thats a good question. I think because the new codebase as developed from scratch rather thanvia changes to the existing one (there is some borrowed code from mciutil).If I just released a new version, anyone leaning on the internal API's would definetly be in troubleas they are not the same.Features========Provides the following command line utilities:* paramconv: Utility for working with MasterCard MPE parameter extract files* mideu: Utility for working with MasterCard IPM filesHistory=======0.6.0 (2018-10-01)------------------* Removed dependency on bitarray (no binary wheels)* Added details on installation for non-python users* 2 years almost since last update!0.5.0 (2016-10-03)------------------* Fixed version display in release version.* Removed support for mongo extract0.4.8 (2016-10-02)------------------* added support for latin1 encoding of csv extract* fixes to setup process so that mideu.yml file is installed* fixed de43 split to allow more formats for different countries0.4.6 (2016-08-09)------------------* added ``--no1014blocking`` option to allow processing of VBS structure files.0.4.5 (2016-08-06)------------------* check that all of message consumed by fields otherwise raise exception* get rid of a heap of debugging prints that were clogging the output* allow freestyle de43 fields with the de43 processor enabled. Use regex rather than string splits0.4.4-0.4.3 (2016-08-03)------------------------* Fix issue with mideu when no parameters passed (stack trace)* Some more debugging messages provided with -d switch* signed the release with key for 0.4.4. need to publish my pub key somewhere..0.4.2 (2016-03-13)------------------* Complete data elements added to default config.* Added versioneer support for easier package versions0.4.1 (2015-12-16)------------------* Additional data elements added to default config file.0.4.0 (2015-10-05)------------------* Now supporting python 2.6 (for all those still using RHEL 6)* Headers rows in mideu csv extracts don't work in 2.60.3.0 (2015-10-03)------------------* added sub commands for mideu* mideu now supports IPM encoding conversion between ascii and ebcdic* Now faster using list comps instead of slow loops0.2.0 (2015-08-28)------------------* Support for config override for mideu - see usage doco* Progress bar while using mideu.. it takes a while* Now supports python 3.4, 3.5 and 2.7.

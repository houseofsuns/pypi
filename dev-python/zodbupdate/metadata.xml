	<longdescription>=============================================================zodbupdate - Update existing databases to match your software=============================================================This package provides a tool that automatically identifies and updatesreferences from persistent objects to classes that are in the process of beingmoved from one module to another and/or being renamed.If a class is being moved or renamed, you need to update all references fromyour database to the new name before finally deleting the old code.This tool looks through all current objects of your database,identifies moved/renamed classes and `touches` objects accordingly. Itcreates transactions that contains the update of your database (onetransaction every 100,000 records).Having run this tool, you are then free to delete the old code... contents::Usage=====Installing the egg of this tool provides a console script `zodbupdate` whichyou can call giving either a FileStorage filename or a configuration filedefining a storage::    $ zodbupdate -f Data.fs    $ zodbupdate -c zodb.confDetailed usage information is available:    $ zodbupdate -hCustom software/eggs--------------------It is important to install this egg in an interpreter/environment where yoursoftware is installed as well. If you're using a regular Python installationor virtualenv, just installing the package using easy_install should be fine.If you are using buildout, installing can be done using the egg recipe withthis configuration::    [buildout]    parts += zodbupdate    [zodbupdate]    recipe = zc.recipe.egg    eggs = zodbupdate        &lt;list additional eggs here&gt;If you do not install `zodbupdate` together with the necessary software itwill report missing classes and not touch your database.Non-FileStorage configurations------------------------------You can configure any storage known to your ZODB installation by providing aZConfig configuration file (similar to zope.conf). For example you can connectto a ZEO server by providing a config file `zeo.conf`::    &lt;zeoclient&gt;        server 127.0.0.1:8100        storage 1    &lt;/zeoclient&gt;And then running `zodbupdate` using:    $ zodbupdate -c zeo.confPre-defined rename rules------------------------Rename rules can be defined using an entry point called ``zodbupdate``::    setup(...          entry_points = &quot;&quot;&quot;          [zodbupdate]          renames = mypackage.mymodule:rename_dict          &quot;&quot;&quot;)These can also be defined in python::    setup(...          entry_points={            'zodbupdate': ['renames = mypackage.mymodule:rename_dict'],          })Those entry points must points to dictionaries that map old classnames to new class names::    rename_dict = {        'mypackage.mymodule ClassName':        'otherpackage.othermodule OtherClass'}As soon as you have rules defined, you can already remove the oldimport location mentioned in them.Packing-------The option ``--pack`` will pack the storage on success. (You tell yourusers to use that option. If they never pack their storage, it is a goodoccasion).Converting to Python 3----------------------``zodbupdate`` can be used to migrate a database created with a Python2 application to be usable with the same application in Python 3. Toaccomplish this, you need to:1. Stop your application. Nothing should be written to the database   while the migration is running.2. Update your Python 2 application to use the latest ZODB version. It   will not work with ZODB 3.3. With Python 2, run ``zodbupdate --pack --convert-py3``.If you use a Data.fs we recommend you to use the ``-f`` option tospecify your database. After the conversion the magic header of thedatabase will be updated so that you will be able to open the databasewith Python 3.If you use a different storage (like RelStorage), be sure you will beconnecting to it using your Python 3 application after themigration. You will still be able to connect to your database and useyour application with Python 2 without errors, but then you will needto convert it again to Python 3.While the pack is not required, it is highly recommended.The conversion will take care of the following tasks:- Updating stored Python datetime, date and time objects to use  Python 3 bytes,- Updating ZODB references to use Python 3 bytes.- Optionally convert stored strings to either unicode or bytes pending  your configuration.If your application expect to use bytes in Python 3, they must bestored as such in the database, and all other strings must be storedas unicode string, if they contain other characters than ascii characters.When using ``--convert-py3``, ``zodbupdate`` will load a set ofdecoders from the entry points::    setup(...          entry_points = &quot;&quot;&quot;          [zodbupdate.decode]          decodes = mypackage.mymodule:decode_dict          &quot;&quot;&quot;)Decoders are dictionaries that specifies as keys attributes onPersistent classes that must either be encoded as bytes (if the valueis ``binary``) or decoded to unicode using value as encoding (forinstance ``utf-8`` here)::    decode_dict = {       'mypackage.mymodule ClassName attribute': 'binary',       'otherpackage.othermodule OtherClass other_attribute': 'utf-8'}Please note that for the moment only attributes on Persistent classesare supported.Please also note that these conversion rules are _only_ selected for the class that is referenced in the pickle, rules for superclasses are _not_ applied. This means that you have to push down annotation rules to all the subclasses of a superclass that has a field that needs this annotation.Converting to Python 3 from within Python 3-------------------------------------------``zodbupdate`` can also be run from within Python 3 to convert a databasecreated with Python 2 to be usable in Python 3. However this worksslightly differently than when running the conversion using Python 2.In Python 3 you must specify a default encoding to use while unpickling strings:``zodbupdate --pack --convert-py3 --encoding utf-8``.For each string in the database, zodbupdate will convert it as follows:1. If it's an attribute configured explicitly via a decoder as described   above, it will be decoded or encoded as specified there.2. Otherwise the value will be decoded using the encoding specified   on the command line.3. If there is an error while decoding using the encoding specified   on the command line, the value will be stored as bytes.Problems and solutions----------------------Your Data.fs has POSKey errors~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~If you call `zodbupdate` with ``-f`` and the path to your Data.fs,records triggering those errors will be ignored.You have another error~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~We recommend to run zodbupdate with ``-v -d`` to get themaximum of information.If you are working on big storages, you can use the option ``-o`` tore-run `zodbupdate` at a failing record you previously encounteredafterward.Changes=======2.0 (2023-02-09)----------------- Add support for Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11.- Drop support for Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6.- Test with history-free and history-preserving RelStorage. Note that  history-preserving RelStorage requires RelStorage 3.3 or above, and  Python 2.7 or Python 3.6 and above.  (`#30 &lt;https://github.com/zopefoundation/zodbupdate/issues/30&gt;`_)1.5 (2020-07-28)----------------- Fixed incompatibility with ZODB 5.6  (`#35 &lt;https://github.com/zopefoundation/zodbupdate/issues/35&gt;`_)- Added support for history-free RelStorage  (`#28 &lt;https://github.com/zopefoundation/zodbupdate/issues/28&gt;`_)- Support zope.interface &gt;= 5 in tests.  (`issue 32 &lt;https://github.com/zopefoundation/zodbupdate/issues/32&gt;`_)1.4 (2019-08-23)----------------- Fail with explanation when opening a Python 2 ZODB with --dry-run on Python 3  (`#22 &lt;https://github.com/zopefoundation/zodbupdate/issues/22&gt;`_)1.3 (2019-07-30)----------------- Support converting sets.Set() objects from ancient Python 2 versions.  (`issue 23 &lt;https://github.com/zopefoundation/zodbupdate/issues/23&gt;`_)- Convert set objects to ``builtins.set`` without relying on ZODB.broken.rebuild.  (`issue 25 &lt;https://github.com/zopefoundation/zodbupdate/pull/25&gt;`_)1.2 (2019-05-09)----------------- Enable fallback encodings for Python 3 conversion for old/grown ZODBs using  the new command line option ``--encoding-fallback``.  (`#15 &lt;https://github.com/zopefoundation/zodbupdate/pull/15&gt;`_)- Switch to use `argparse` as `optparse` is deprecated.- Add ability to run the Python 3 migration with a default encoding for  ``str`` objects.  (`#14 &lt;https://github.com/zopefoundation/zodbupdate/pull/14&gt;`_)- Fix updating records that reference a broken interface  when the interface's top-level module is missing.- Fixed skipping of blob records so that oids in references to blobs  are still converted.- Add support for Python 3.8a3.- Drop support for Python 3.4.1.1 (2018-10-05)----------------- Skip records for ZODB.blob when migrating database to Python 3 to not break  references to blobfiles.- When migrating databases to Python 3, do not fail when converting  attributes containing None.- Fix tests on Python 2 with ZODB &gt;= 5.4.0, which now uses pickle  protocol 3.- Fix `is_broken` check for old-style class instances.- Add support for Python 3.7.- Drop PyPy support.1.0 (2018-02-13)----------------- Support Python 2.7 and 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6 and pypy 3. Drop any older  version of Python.- The option to the select the pickler (``--pickler``) has been  removed. This was only useful if you had extension classes with  Python 2.5 or less.- Added an option to convert a database to Python 3.0.5 (2010-10-07)----------------- More debug logging shows now the currently processed OID  (that is helpful to determine which object misses the factory).- Support for missing factories have been improved: an error used to  occur if a pickle needed an update and contained a reference to a  missing class (not instance of this class). This case is now fixed.- Python 2.4 is no longer supported. Please stick to version 0.3 if  you need Python 2.4 support.0.4 (2010-07-14)----------------- Add an option to debug broken records.- Add an option to skip records.- Add an option to use Python unPickler instead of C one. This let you  debug records. As well Python unPickler let you update old ExtensionClass  records who had a special hack in the past.- Broken interfaces are well supported now (if you did alsoProvides with them).0.3 (2010-02-02)----------------- Unplickle and re-pickle the code to rename references to moved classes.  This make the script works on database created with older versions of  ZODB.- If you are working directly with a FileStorage, POSKeyError are reported  but non-fatal.- Remove superfluous code that tried to prevent commits when no changes  happened: ZODB does this all by itself already.0.2 (2009-06-23)----------------- Add option to store the rename rules into a file.- Don't commit transactions that have no changes.- Load rename rules from entry points ``zodbupdate``.- Compatibility with Python 2.4- Rename from ``zodbupgrade`` to ``zodbupdate``.- Add 'verbose' option.- Improve logging.- Suppress duplicate log messages (e.g. if the same class is missing in  multiple objects).- Improve the updating process: rewrite pickle opcodes instead of blindly  touching a class. This also allows updating pickles that can't be unpickled  due to missing classes.0.1 (2009-06-08)----------------- First release.</longdescription>

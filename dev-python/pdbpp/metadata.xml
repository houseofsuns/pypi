	<longdescription>.. -*- restructuredtext -*-pdb++, a drop-in replacement for pdb====================================What is it?------------This module is an extension of the pdb_ module of the standard library.  It ismeant to be fully compatible with its predecessor, yet it introduces a numberof new features to make your debugging experience as nice as possible... image:: https://github.com/antocuni/pdb/blob/master/screenshot.png?raw=true``pdb++`` features include:  - colorful TAB completion of Python expressions (through fancycompleter_)  - optional syntax highlighting of code listings (through pygments_)  - `sticky mode`_  - several new commands to be used from the interactive ``(Pdb++)`` prompt  - `smart command parsing`_ (hint: have you ever typed ``r`` or ``c`` at the    prompt to print the value of some variable?)  - additional convenience functions in the ``pdb`` module, to be used from    your program``pdb++`` is meant to be a drop-in replacement for ``pdb``. If you find someunexpected behavior, please report it as a bug... _pdb: http://docs.python.org/library/pdb.html.. _fancycompleter: http://bitbucket.org/antocuni/fancycompleter.. _pygments: http://pygments.org/Installation-------------Since ``pdb++`` is not a valid identifier for ``pip`` and ``easy_install``,the package is named ``pdbpp``::    $ pip install pdbpp    -- OR --    $ easy_install pdbpp``pdb++`` is also available via `conda`_::    $ conda install -c conda-forge pdbppAlternatively, you can just put ``pdb.py`` somewhere inside your``PYTHONPATH``... _conda: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pdbppUsage-----Note that the module is called ``pdb.py`` so that ``pdb++`` will automaticallybe used in all places that do ``import pdb`` (e.g. ``pytest --pdb`` willgive you a ``pdb++`` prompt).The old ``pdb`` module is still available by doing e.g. ``import pdb;pdb.pdb.set_trace()``.New interactive commands------------------------The following are new commands that you can use from the interative``(Pdb++)`` prompt... _`sticky mode`:``sticky [start end]``  Toggle **sticky mode**.  When in this mode, every time the current position  changes, the screen is repainted and the whole function shown.  Thus, when  doing step-by-step execution you can easily follow the flow of the  execution.  If ``start`` and ``end`` are given, sticky mode is enabled and  only lines within that range (extremes included) will be displayed.``longlist`` (``ll``)  List source code for the current function.  Different from the normal pdb  ``list`` command, ``longlist`` displays the whole function.  The current  line is marked with ``-&gt;``.  In case of post-mortem debugging, the line  which actually raised the exception is marked with ``&gt;&gt;``.  If the  ``highlight`` `config option`_ is set and pygments_ is installed, the source  code is highlighted.``interact``  Start an interative interpreter whose global namespace contains all the  names found in the current scope.``track EXPRESSION``  Display a graph showing which objects are the value of the expression refers  to and are referred by.  This command requires the ``pypy`` source code to  be importable.``display EXPRESSION``  Add an expression to the **display list**; expressions in this list are  evaluated at each step, and printed every time its value changes.  **WARNING**: since these expressions are evaluated multiple times, make sure  not to put expressions with side-effects in the display list.``undisplay EXPRESSION``:  Remove ``EXPRESSION`` from the display list.``source EXPRESSION``  Show the source code for the given function/method/class.``edit EXPRESSION``  Open the editor in the right position to edit the given  function/method/class.  The editor used is specified in a `config  option`_.``hf_unhide``, ``hf_hide``, ``hf_list``  Some frames might be marked as &quot;hidden&quot; by e.g. using the `@pdb.hideframe`_  function decorator.  By default, hidden frames are not shown in the stack  trace, and cannot be reached using ``up`` and ``down``.  You can use  ``hf_unhide`` to tell pdb to ignore the hidden status (i.e., to treat hidden  frames as normal ones), and ``hf_hide`` to hide them again.  ``hf_list``  prints a list of hidden frames.  The config option ``enable_hidden_frames`` can be used to disable handling  of hidden frames in general.Smart command parsing----------------------By default, pdb tries hard to interpret what you enter at the command promptas one of its builtin commands.  However, this is inconvenient if you want tojust print the value of a local variable which happens to have the same nameas one of the commands. E.g.::    (Pdb) list      1      2     def fn():      3         c = 42      4         import pdb;pdb.set_trace()      5  -&gt;     return c    (Pdb) cIn the example above, instead of printing 42 pdb interprets the input as thecommand ``continue``, and then you loose your prompt.  It's even worse thanthat, because it happens even if you type e.g. ``c.__class__``.pdb++ fixes this unfriendly (from the author's point of view, of course :-))behavior by always prefering variable in scope, if it exists.  If you reallywant to execute the corresponding command, you can prefix it with ``!!``.Thus, the example above becomes::    (Pdb++) list      1      2     def fn():      3         c = 42      4         import pdb;pdb.set_trace()      5  -&gt;     return c    (Pdb++) c    42    (Pdb++) !!cNote that the &quot;smart&quot; behavior takes place only when there is ambiguity, i.e.if there exists a variable with the same name as a command: in all othercases, everything works as usual.Regarding the ``list`` command itself, using ``list(…`` is a special casethat gets handled as the Python builtin::    (Pdb++) list([1, 2])    [1, 2]Additional functions in the ``pdb`` module------------------------------------------The ``pdb`` module that comes with pdb++ includes all the functions andclasses that are in the module from the standard library.  If you find anydifference, please report it as a bug.In addition, there are some new convenience functions that are unique topdb++.``pdb.xpm()``  eXtended Post Mortem: it is equivalent to  ``pdb.post_mortem(sys.exc_info()[2])``.  If used inside an ``except``  clause, it will start a post-mortem pdb prompt from the line that raised the  exception being caught.``pdb.disable()``  Disable ``pdb.set_trace()``: any subsequent call to it will be ignored.``pdb.enable()``  Re-enable ``pdb.set_trace()``, in case it was disabled by ``pdb.disable()``... _`@pdb.hideframe`:``@pdb.hideframe``  A function decorator that tells pdb++ to hide the frame corresponding to the  function.  Hidden frames do not show up when using interactive commands such  as ``up``, ``down`` or ``where``, unless ``hf_unhide`` is invoked.``@pdb.break_on_setattr(attrname, condition=always)``  class decorator: break the execution of the program every time the  attribute ``attrname`` is set on any instance of the class. ``condition`` is  a callable that takes the target object of the ``setattr`` and the actual value;  by default, it breaks every time the attribute is set. E.g.::      @break_on_setattr('bar')      class Foo(object):          pass      f = Foo()      f.bar = 42    # the program breaks here  If can be used even after the class has already been created, e.g. if we  want to break when some attribute of a particular object is set::      class Foo(object):          pass      a = Foo()      b = Foo()      def break_if_a(obj, value):          return obj is a      break_on_setattr('bar', condition=break_if_a)(Foo)      b.bar = 10   # no break      a.bar = 42   # the program breaks here  This can be used after ``pdb.set_trace()`` also::      (Pdb++) import pdb      (Pdb++) pdb.break_on_setattr('tree_id')(obj.__class__)      (Pdb++) continueConfiguration and customization-------------------------------.. _`config option`:To customize pdb++, you can put a file named ``.pdbrc.py`` in your homedirectory.  The file must contain a class named ``Config`` inheriting from``pdb.DefaultConfig`` and override the desired values.The following is a list of the options you can customize, together with theirdefault value:``prompt = '(Pdb++) '``  The prompt to show when in interactive mode.``highlight = True``  Highlight line numbers and the current line when showing the ``longlist`` of  a function or when in **sticky mode**.``encoding = 'utf-8'``  File encoding. Useful when there are international characters in your string  literals or comments.``sticky_by_default = False``  Determine whether pdb++ starts in sticky mode or not.``line_number_color = Color.turquoise``  The color to use for line numbers.``filename_color = Color.yellow``  The color to use for file names when printing the stack entries.``current_line_color = &quot;39;49;7&quot;``  The SGR parameters for the ANSI escape sequence to highlight the current  line.  This is set inside the SGR escape sequence ``\e[%sm`` where ``\e`` is the  ESC character and ``%s`` the given value.  See `SGR parameters`_.  The following means &quot;reset all colors&quot; (``0``), set foreground color to 18  (``48;5;18``), and background to ``21``.  The default uses the default foreground (``39``) and background (``49``)  colors, inversed (``7``).``use_pygments = True``  If pygments_ is installed and ``highlight == True``, apply syntax highlight  to the source code when showing the ``longlist`` of a function or when in  **sticky mode**.``bg = 'dark'``  Passed directly to the ``pygments.formatters.TerminalFormatter`` constructor.  Selects the color scheme to use, depending on the background color of your  terminal. If you have a light background color, try to set it to  ``'light'``.``colorscheme = None``  Passed directly to the ``pygments.formatters.TerminalFormatter`` constructor.  It expects a dictionary that maps token types to (lightbg, darkbg) color names or  ``None`` (default: ``None`` = use builtin colorscheme).``editor = '${EDITOR:-vi}'``  The command to invoke when using the ``edit`` command. By default, it uses  ``$EDITOR`` if set, else ``vi``.  The command must support the standard  notation ``COMMAND +n filename`` to open filename at line ``n``. ``emacs``  and ``vi`` are known to support this.``truncate_long_lines = True``  Truncate lines which exceed the terminal width.``exec_if_unfocused = None``  Shell command to execute when starting the pdb prompt and the terminal  window is not focused.  Useful to e.g. play a sound to alert the user that  the execution of the program stopped. It requires the wmctrl_ module.``disable_pytest_capturing = False``  Old versions of `pytest`_ crash when you execute ``pdb.set_trace()`` in a  test, but the standard output is captured (i.e., without the ``-s`` option,  which is the default behavior).  When this option is on, the stdout  capturing is automatically disabled before showing the interactive prompt.``enable_hidden_frames = True``  Certain frames can be hidden by default.  If enabled, the commands ``hf_unhide``, ``hf_hide``, and ``hf_list`` can be  used to control display of them.``show_hidden_frames_count = True``  If ``enable_hidden_frames`` is ``True`` this controls if the number of  hidden frames gets displayed.``def setup(self, pdb): pass``  This method is called during the initialization of the ``Pdb`` class. Useful  to do complex setup.``show_traceback_on_error = True``  Display tracebacks for errors via ``Pdb.error``, that come from  ``Pdb.default`` (i.e. the execution of an unrecognized pdb command),  and are not a direct cause of the expression itself (e.g. ``NameError``  with a command like ``doesnotexist``).  With this option disabled only ``*** exception string`` gets printed, which  often misses useful context.``show_traceback_on_error_limit = None``  This option sets the limit to be used with ``traceback.format_exception``,  when ``show_traceback_on_error`` is enabled... _wmctrl: http://bitbucket.org/antocuni/wmctrl.. _`pytest`: https://pytest.org/.. _SGR parameters: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#SGR_parametersCoding guidelines-----------------``pdb++`` is developed using Test Driven Development, and we try to keep testcoverage high.As a general rule, every commit should come with its own test. If it's a newfeature, it should come with one or many tests which excercise it. If it's abug fix, the test should **fail before the fix**, and pass after.The goal is to make refactoring easier in the future: if you wonder why acertain line of code does something, in principle it should be possible tocomment it out and see which tests fail.In exceptional cases, the test might be too hard or impossible to write: inthat cases it is fine to do a commmit without a test, but you should explainvery precisely in the commit message why it is hard to write a test and how toreproduce the buggy behaviour by hand.It is fine NOT to write a test in the following cases:  - typos, documentation, and in general any non-coding commit  - code refactorings which do not add any feature  - commits which fix an already failing test  - commits to silence warnings  - purely cosmetic changes, such as change the color of the outputCHANGELOG=========Changes between 0.10.2 and 0.10.3=================================Minor bugfix release, moving Continuous Integration from Travis/AppVeyor toGitHub Actions, based on changes on master, but without the (more invasive)(test) fixes for Windows.- Fixes  - Fix hideframe decorator for Python 3.8+ (#263)  - Fix hidden_frames discrepancy with IPython (#426)- Misc  - ci: move to GitHub Actions (#444, #445)  - ci: use .coveragerc (#304)  - qa/flake8 fixes  - test fix for newer PyPy3Changes between 0.10.0 and 0.10.2=================================Minor bugfix release to make pdb++ work better with a system-wide installationfrom within a virtualenv.- Fixes  - Fix pth hack: skip if added already (#297)Version 0.10.2 fixes only the deployment configuration.Changes between 0.9.15 and 0.10.0=================================- Changes  - config: improve current_line_color: default fg/bg/inversed (#188)  - Show tracebacks for errors with interactively run code (#185)    This adds new config settings &quot;show_traceback_on_error&quot;

	<longdescription>## earcut-pythonA pure Python port of the earcut JavaScript triangulation library. The latest version is based off of the earcut 2.1.1 release, and there have been following enhancements:- if `dimensions == 2`, project data into 2D instead of triangulating only first two coordinatesThe original project can be found here:https://github.com/mapbox/earcut### PypiAvailable on [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/earcut/)```pip install earcut```#### Usage```pythontriangles = earcut([10,0, 0,50, 60,60, 70,10]) # Returns [1,0,3, 3,2,1]```Signature: `earcut(vertices[, holes, dimensions = 2])`.* `vertices` is a flat array of vertex coordinates like `[x0,y0, x1,y1, x2,y2, ...]`.* `holes` is an array of hole _indices_ if any  (e.g. `[5, 8]` for a 12-vertex input would mean one hole with vertices 5&amp;ndash;7 and another with 8&amp;ndash;11).* `dimensions` is the number of coordinates per vertex in the input array (`2` by default).Each group of three vertex indices in the resulting array forms a triangle.```python# Triangulating a polygon with a holeearcut([0,0, 100,0, 100,100, 0,100,  20,20, 80,20, 80,80, 20,80], [4])# [3,0,4, 5,4,0, 3,4,7, 5,0,1, 2,3,7, 6,5,1, 2,7,6, 6,1,2]# Triangulating a polygon with 3d coordsearcut([10,0,1, 0,50,2, 60,60,3, 70,10,4], null, 3)# [1,0,3, 3,2,1]```If you pass a single vertex as a hole, Earcut treats it as a Steiner point.If your input is a multi-dimensional array, you can convert it to the format expected by Earcut with `earcut.flatten`:```python# The first sequence of vertices is treated as the outer hull, the following sequneces are treated as holes.data = earcut.flatten([[(0,0), (100,0), (100,100), (0,100)], [(20,20), (80,20), (80,80), (20,80)]])triangles = earcut(data['vertices'], data['holes'], data['dimensions'])```After getting a triangulation, you can verify its correctness with `earcut.deviation`:```pythondeviation = earcut.deviation(vertices, holes, dimensions, triangles)```Returns the relative difference between the total area of triangles and the area of the input polygon.`0` means the triangulation is fully correct.</longdescription>

Threadless version of `QueuedSocket`)The __parallel__ package:* parallelize (A decorator to easily convert a regular function into a parallelized version)* parallelize2 (A similar parallelization decorator with a slightly different flavor)* IterDispatcher (Logical backend for dispatching calls with parallelize)* DemandDispatcher (Logical backend for dispatching calls with parallelize2)* ThreadWorker (Task management backend for dispatching parallel calls to threads)* ProcessWorker (Task management backend for dispatching parallel calls to processes)The __security__ package:* SecureSocket (A mid-level network IO class built to manage encrypted network communications)* SecureConnection (A high-level, multithreaded class for sending and receiving encrypted files and messages)* SecureServer (A low-level listen server to accept connections and return SecureConnection instances)* agutil-secure (A command line utility for encrypting and decrypting files)* EncryptionCipher and DecryptionCipher (Twin classes for agutil's modular encryption format)* Several other utility functions and classes for encrypting and decrypting data## Documentation:Detailed documentation of these packages can be found on the [agutil Github wiki page](https://gitlab.graubert.com/agraubert/agutil/-/wikis/home)</longdescription>

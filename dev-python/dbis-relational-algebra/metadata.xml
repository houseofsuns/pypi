	<longdescription># DBIS Relational Algebra[![pypi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/dbis-relational-algebra)](https://pypi.org/project/dbis-relational-algebra/)[![PyPI Status](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/dbis-relational-algebra)](https://pypi.org/project/dbis-relational-algebra/)This library provides a Python implementation of the [relational algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra).# Features - Create expressions of the relational algebra in python. - Load data from SQLite tables. - Evaluate expressions on the data. - Convert these expressions to text in LaTeX math mode. - Convert a relation / the result of an expression to a Markdown table.# InstallationInstall via pip:```bashpip install dbis-relational-algebra```# Usage## Overview of supported operators- [x] Cross Product / Cartesian Product (`*`)- [x] Difference (`-`)- [x] Division (`/`)- [x] Intersection (`&amp;`)- [x] Left Semijoin- [x] Natural Join- [x] Projection- [x] Rename- [x] Right Semijoin- [x] Selection- [x] Theta Join- [x] Union (`|`)The set operators Union, Intersection, and Difference require the relations to be [union-compatible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra#Union-compatible_relations).## FormulasFor the Theta Join and the Selection, a formula is used to specify the join or selection condition. These formulas can be created using the following operators:- [x] And- [x] Or- [x] Not- [x] Equals- [x] GreaterEquals- [x] GreaterThan- [x] LessEquals- [x] LessThanIn the comparators, two values have to be specified. At least one of these values must be a python `str`, which references a column of the relation.## Loading data &amp; Evaluating an expressionTo load data, an [SQLite connection](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) can be used (recommended). This connection must be passed to the relational algebra expression for the evaluation.It is also possible to load a relation with data by hand (not recommended):```pythonrelation = Relation(name=&quot;R&quot;)relation.add_attributes([&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;])relation.add_rows([[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, 9],])```An expression can be created by using the operators and formulas listed above. The expression can then be evaluated on the data:```python# Cross Product RxS, see aboveexpression = Relation(&quot;R&quot;) * Relation(&quot;S&quot;)result = expression.evaluate(sql_con=connection)``````python# Theta Join R.a = S.b, see aboveexpression = ThetaJoin(&quot;R&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, Not(Equals(&quot;R.a&quot;, &quot;S.b&quot;)))result = expression.evaluate(sql_con=connection)```The rows and column names of a relation (result) are accessible using the following attributes:```pythonresult.attributes # list of column names (str)result.rows # set of rows (tuple)```## Best practices: - After joining two relations or the cross product of two relations, you should always give column names that appear in both relations a new distinct name. - After joining two relations, the cross product of two relations, or some set operation on two relations, you should always give the resulting relation a new distinct name. - When referencing a column in a comparator, it is recommended that this column should be referred to using a detailed description, i.e. refer to column `a` of relation `R` as `&quot;R.a&quot;` instead of `&quot;a&quot;`.# Developer NotesA few design choices were made: - Internally, the data is stored in a [pandas DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html). This accelerates the relational algebra operators greatly. - In relational algebra, a column `a` from a relation `R` can be referred to as `a` and `R.a`. Internally, the column name is always stored using the full name, i.e. `R.a`. This is done to avoid ambiguities when a column `a` is present in multiple relations. - When joining two relations (or also cross product), the relational algebra provides no guidelines on how the resulting relation should be named. Thus, if `a` is a column of relation `R`, joining relations `R` and `S` results in a relation, where `R.a` and `S.a` might refer to this column `a` (depending on if `a` also references a column in `S`). Thus, generally speaking, joining two relations `R` and `S` will internally result in a relation named `R+S`, and the column `R.a` will now be named `R+S.a` (if there is no column `S.a`).</longdescription>

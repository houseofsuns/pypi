	<longdescription>## Google Earth Engine (GEE) UtilitiesThis project provides a few simple utility functions for interacting with GEE.### AuthenticationTo function properly, this code needs credentials that it can use to authenticate against the Google Earth Engine API.  Credentials can be provided in one of two ways, and the code will look for them in this order:1. Service Account Key.Before running this code, create an environment variable named `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` containing the JSON key for a Google Cloud service account with the necessary permissions to perform the actions you're trying to perform in GEE.2. Personal Credentials.Before running this code, authenticate with the Google Earth Engine API using the [earthengine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/command_line) command line tool:```$ earthengine authenticate```### DevelopmentThis project uses [Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/) to manage virtual environments and dependencies. Development-time dependencies are documented in the `Pipfile`. Follow the `Pipenv` documentation to create a virtual environment and install the dependencies.This project also uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to run various Python code quality checks (linting and styling) on every commit.  Before you begin any development work, install the pre-commit hook with:```bash$ pre-commit install```#### MakefileThe included `Makefile` prescribes actions to test, build, and publish this code to a Python Package Index (PyPI) repository as described in the following sections.```$ make [test | build | publish]```#### TestingWith the virtual environment active and the dependencies installed, use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) to run the test suite.#### BuildingThis project uses the [setuptools](https://packaging.python.org/key_projects/#setuptools) Python package for packaging as described [here](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/).When building via the `make build` command, you may optionally append to the package name using the `prerelease` argument. For example, if the current version of `geeutils` specified in the `setup.py` module is `1.2.3`, then```$ make build prerelease=rc1```will produce a package named `geeutils-1.2.3rc1`. The default is a beta prerelease name incremented by each git commit (eg/ `1.2.3b7` for the seventh commit on this branch). Specify a final release with```$ make build prerelease=&quot;&quot;```Note that prerelease names must comply with [PEP 440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/).#### PublishingThis project uses the [twine](https://packaging.python.org/key_projects/#twine) Python package for distribution as described [here](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/).When publishing via the `make publish` command, the default PyPI repository is [testpypi](https://packaging.python.org/guides/using-testpypi/). To publish to [pypi.org](https://pypi.org), specify that repository:```$ make publish pypi_repository=pypi```The credentials necessary to publish to the target PyPI repository can be provided in one of two ways.1. As these environment variables:| Env Var                      | Notes                                      || :--------:                   | ------------------------------------------ || `PYPI_REPOSITORY_USERNAME`   | PyPI account username. If authenticating [using a token](https://test.pypi.org/help/#apitoken), use the literal string `__token__`. || `PYPI_REPOSITORY_PASSWORD`   | PyPI account password. If authenticating [using a token](https://test.pypi.org/help/#apitoken), use the token contents. |2. At the `make publish` command:```$ make publish pypi_repository_username=&quot;foo&quot; pypi_repository_password=&quot;bar&quot;```</longdescription>

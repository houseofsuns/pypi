If you want to the parsing to fail on any errors, use the `--strict` flag:```bashembody-file testfiles/v5_0_0_test_file.log --strict```### Plot binary file in graphTo show an ECG/PPG plot graph:```bashembody-file testfiles/v5_0_0_test_file.log --plot```## Troubleshooting### I get an error in the middle of the file - how do I start finding the root cause?To get the best overview, start by running the parser in strict mode and with debug logging, so it stops at the first error:```bashembody-file troublesomefile.log --strict --log-level DEBUG```This provides positional information per message so it's easier to continue searching for errors.If this doesn't give us enough information, look at the protocol documentation and start looking and the problematic areas in the input file.There are several command line tools you can use. On MAC and Linux, one good example is to use the `hexdump` tool:```bashhexdump -C -n 70 -s 0 troublesomefile.log```Here, `-n 70` is the amount of bytes to print in hex format, and `-s 0` tells hexdump to start at position 0 in the file. Adjust these parameters according to your needs.Make a note from the parser's error output of what position the first error started from, and based on that:- Look at the preceding bytes to see whether there were any errors in the previous protocol message- Look at the bytes from the reported (error) position to see if there are just a few bytes before a new, plausible protocol message starts## ContributingContributions are very welcome.To learn more, see the [Contributor Guide].## IssuesIf you encounter any problems,please [file an issue] along with a detailed description.[file an issue]: https://github.com/aidee-health/embody-file/issues[pip]: https://pip.pypa.io/&lt;!-- github-only --&gt;[license]: https://github.com/aidee-health/embody-file/blob/main/LICENSE[contributor guide]: https://github.com/aidee-health/embody-file/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md[command-line reference]: https://embody-file.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html</longdescription>

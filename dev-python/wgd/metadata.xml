For the propose of illustrating the principle and usage of `wgd v2`, we compiled this documentation. Below we first give an introduction over the scope and mechanism of `wgd v2` and then the practical information of installation and usage. An examplar workflow is provided in the tutorial section on how to seek evidence for a putative WGD event and perform proper timing with a freshly obtained genome assembly in hand. For those who are interested, we recommend turning to our paper and book chapter for more detailed description and insightful discussions. If you use `wgd v2` in your research, please cite us. ## IntroductionPolyploidizations, the evolutionary process that the entire genome of an organism is duplicated, also named as whole-genome duplications (WGDs), occur recurrently across the tree of life. There are two modes of polyploidizations, autopolyploidizations and allopolyploidizations. Autopolyploidizations are the duplication of the same genome, resulting in two identical subgenomes at the time it emerged. While the allopolyploidizations are normally achieved in two steps, first the hybridization between two different species, resulting in the arising of transient homoploidy,second the duplication of the homoploidy, resulting in the emergence of allopolyploidy. Due to the unstability and unbalanced tetrasomic inheritance, for instance the nuclear-cytoplasmic incompatibility, the polyploidy genome will then experience a process called diploidization, also named as fractionation, during which a large portion of gene duplicates will get lost and only a fraction can be retained. The traces of polyploidizations can be thus unearthed from these retained gene duplicates. Three approaches based on gene duplicates, namely, *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; method, gene tree - species tree reconciliation method and synteny method, are commonly used in detecting evidence for WGDs. The gene tree - species tree reconciliation method is not within the scope of `wgd v2`, but we kindly refer readers who are interested to the phylogenomic program developed by Arthur Zwaenepoel named [WHALE](https://github.com/arzwa/Whale.jl) and the associated [paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msz088) for more technical and theoretical details.The *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; method is established on a model of gene family evolution that each gene family is allowed to evolve via gene duplication and loss. Note that the gene family here is assumed to be the cluster of all genes descended from an ancestral gene in a single genome. Recovering the gene tree of such gene family informs the timing, scilicet the age, of gene duplication events. The age refered here, is not in real geological time, but in the unit of evolutionary distance, i.e., the number of substitutions per site. When the evolutionary rate remains approximately constant, the evolutionary distance is then supposed to be proportional to the real evolutionary time. The synonymous distance *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;, the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site, is such candidate that synonymous substitutions would not incur the change of amino acid and are thus regarded as neutral, which according to the neutral theory should occur in constant rate. Given a model of gene family that allows the gene to duplicate and get lost in a fixed rate, one can derive that the probability density function of the *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; age distribution of retained gene duplicates is a quasi-exponential function that most retained gene duplicates are recently borned with ~0 age while as the age going older the associated number of retained gene duplicates decay quasi-exponentially. Therefore, the occurance of large-scale gene duplication events, for instane WGDs, with varied retention rate, will leave an age peak from the burst of gene duplicates in a short time-frame upon the initial age distribution, and can be unveiled from mixture modeling analysis. However, WGDs identified from the paralogous *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; age distributions can only inform the WGD timing in the time-scale of that specific species, which is not comparable in the phylogenetic context. Only with the orthologous *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; age distributions, which convert the estimated body from paralogues to orthologues and inform the relative timing of speciation events, can we decipher the phylogenetic placement of WGDs after proper rate correction. `wgd v2` is such program that helps users construct paralogous and orthologous *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; age distributions and realize both the identification and placement of WGDs.## InstallationThe easiest way to install `wgd v2` is using PYPI. Note that if you want to get the latest update, we suggest installing from the source, since the update on PYPI will be delayed compared to here in the source.```pip install wgd```To install `wgd v2` in a virtual environment, the following command lines could be used.```git clone &lt;wgd repo&gt;cd wgdvirtualenv -p=python3 ENV (or python3 -m venv ENV)source ENV/bin/activatepip install -r requirements.txtpip install .```When met with permission problem in installation, please try the following command line.```pip install -e .```If multiply versions of `wgd` were installed in the system, please add the right path of interested version into the environment variables, for example```export PATH=&quot;$PATH:~/.local/bin/wgd&quot;```Note that the version of `numpy` is important (for many other packages are the same of course), especially for `fastcluster` package. In our test, the `numpy` 1.19.0 works fine on `python3.6/8`. If you met some errors or warnings about numpy, maybe considering pre-install `numpy` as 1.19.0 or other close-by versions before you install `wgd`.## ParametersThere are 7 main programs in `wgd v2`: `dmd`,`focus`,`ksd`,`mix`,`peak`,`syn`,`viz`. Hereafter we will provide a detailed elucidation on each of the program and its associated parameters.The program `wgd dmd` can realize the delineation of whole paranome, RBHs, MRBHs, orthogroups and

of bases and the other in the unit of genes, which can be colored by *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; values given *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; data.![](data/Aquilegia_coerulea-vs-Aquilegia_coerulea_Ks.dot_unit_gene.png)As shown above, the dot plot in the unit of genes presents numerous densely aggregated (line-like) anchor points at most of the chromosomes with consistent *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; age between 1 and 2. The dot plot in the unit of bases shows the same pattern, as manifested below.![](data/Aquilegia_coerulea-vs-Aquilegia_coerulea_Ks.dot.png)The dot plots without *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; annotation will also be automately produced, as shown below.![](data/Aquilegia_coerulea-vs-Aquilegia_coerulea.dot_unit_gene.png)![](data/Aquilegia_coerulea-vs-Aquilegia_coerulea.dot.png)Note that the opacity of anchor dots and all homolog dots can be set by the option `apalpha` and `hoalpha` separately. If one just wants to see the anchor dots, setting the `hoalpha` as 0 (or other minuscule values) will do. If one wants to see the distribution of whole dots better, setting the `hoalpha` higher (and `apalpha` lower) will do. The `dotsize` option can be called to adjust the size of dots.A further associated Syndepth plot shows that there are more than 80 duplicated segments, which dominates the whole collinear ratio category.![](data/Syndepth.svg)We can fit an ELMM mixture model upon the whole paranome *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; age distribution to see more accurately the significance and location of potential WGDs, using the command line below.```wgd viz -d wgd_ksd/Aquilegia_coerulea.tsv.ks.tsv```The result of ELMM mixture model clustering shows that there is a likely WGD component at *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; 1.19.![](data/elmm_Aquilegia_coerulea.tsv.ks.tsv_best_models_weighted.svg)Let's do a mixture model clustering for anchor *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; too, using the command line below.```wgd peak wgd_ksd/Aquilegia_coerulea.tsv.ks.tsv --anchorpoints wgd_syn/iadhore-out/anchorpoints.txt --segments wgd_syn/iadhore-out/segments.txt --listelements wgd_syn/iadhore-out/list_elements.txt --multipliconpairs wgd_syn/iadhore-out/multiplicon_pairs.txt --weighted```The anchor *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; age distribution also has a likely WGD component with mode 1.28.![](data/Original_AnchorKs_GMM_Component3_node_weighted_Lognormal.svg)Now that we have seen the evidence of numerous duplicated segments and the aggregation of duplicates age in *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; around 1.2 for anchor pairs and non-anchor pairs throughout the whole genome. We can claim with some confidence that *Aquilegia coerulea* might have experienced a paleo-polyploidization event. Next, Let's have a further look about its phylogenetic location. We know that there are uncertainties about whether this putative paleo-polyploidization event is shared with all eudicots or not. We can choose some other eudicot genomes to see the ordering of speciation and polyploidization events. Here we choose *Vitis vinifera*, *Protea cynaroides* and *Acorus americanus* in the following *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; analysis. First, we built a global MRBH family using the command below.```wgd dmd --globalmrbh Aquilegia_coerulea Protea_cynaroides Acorus_americanus Vitis_vinifera -o wgd_globalmrbh```In the global MRBH family, every pair of orthologous genes is the reciprocal best hit, suggesting true orthologous relationships. We would use the *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; values associated with these orthologous pairs to delimit the divergence *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; peak. Together with the whole paranome *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; distribution, we conduct the rate correction using the command below.```wgd ksd wgd_globalmrbh/global_MRBH.tsv --extraparanomeks wgd_ksd/Aquilegia_coerulea.tsv.ks.tsv -sp speciestree.nw --reweight -o wgd_globalmrbh_ks --spair &quot;Aquilegia_coerulea;Protea_cynaroides&quot; --spair &quot;Aquilegia_coerulea;Vitis_vinifera&quot; --spair &quot;Aquilegia_coerulea;Acorus_americanus&quot; --spair &quot;Aquilegia_coerulea;Aquilegia_coerulea&quot; --plotkde (-ap wgd_syn/iadhore-out/anchorpoints.txt)```The file `speciestree.nw` is the text file of species tree in newick that rate correction would be conducted on. Its content is as below. Users need to provide the species pairs to be plotted. We suggest adding the option `--reweight` to recalculate the weight per species pair such that the weight of orthologous gene pairs will become 1 as the paralogous gene pairs. The flag `--plotkde` can be added when the kde curve of orthologous *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; is desired. Extra collinear data can be added by the option `-ap`.```(((Vitis_vinifera,Protea_cynaroides),Aquilegia_coerulea),Acorus_americanus);```![](data/Aquilegia_coerulea_GlobalmrbhKs_Corrected.ksd.svg)As shown above, because of the higher substitution rate of *Aquilegia coerulea*, the original orthologous *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; values were actually underestimated in the time-frame of *Aquilegia coerulea*. When we recovered the divergence substitution distance in terms of two times of the branch-specific contribution of *Aquilegia coerulea* since its divergence with the sister species plus the shared substitution distance before divergence (in relative to the outgroup), the corrected *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; mode became larger.If one had the orthologous *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; data already, one could also apply the program `wgd viz` to conduct the rate correction analysis using the command below. Note that the order of given `spair` options decides the color of the *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; distribution of each species pair.```wgd viz -d wgd_globalmrbh_ks/global_MRBH.tsv.ks.tsv --extraparanomeks wgd_ksd/Aquilegia_coerulea.tsv.ks.tsv -sp speciestree.nw --reweight -ap wgd_syn/iadhore-out/anchorpoints.txt -o wgd_viz_mixed_Ks --spair &quot;Aquilegia_coerulea;Protea_cynaroides&quot; --spair &quot;Aquilegia_coerulea;Vitis_vinifera&quot; --spair &quot;Aquilegia_coerulea;Acorus_americanus&quot; --spair &quot;Aquilegia_coerulea;Aquilegia_coerulea&quot; --gsmap gene_species.map --plotkde```Note that we can easily show that *Aquilegia coerulea* has higher substitution rate than *Protea cynaroides* and *Vitis vinifera* by comparing their substitution distance in regard to the same divergence event with outgroup species *Acorus_americanus*, using command below.```wgd viz -d wgd_globalmrbh_ks/global_MRBH.tsv.ks.tsv -sp speciestree.nw --reweight -o wgd_viz_Compare_rate --spair &quot;Acorus_americanus;Protea_cynaroides&quot; --spair &quot;Aquilegia_coerulea;Acorus_americanus&quot; --spair &quot;Vitis_vinifera;Acorus_americanus&quot; --gsmap gene_species.map --plotkde```![](data/Raw_Orthologues_Compare_rate.ksd.svg)As displayed above, the orthologous *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; values bewteen *Aquilegia coerulea* and *Acorus americanus* has the highest mode, indicatingthe faster substitution rate of *Aquilegia coerulea* compared to *Protea cynaroides* and *Vitis vinifera*.Note that a necessary gene-species map file is needed for its implementation in `wgd viz`, which should be automately produced by the last `wgd ksd` step. The `gene_species.map` has contents as below in which each line is the joined string of gene name and species name by space.```Aqcoe6G057800.1 Aquilegia_coeruleaVvi_VIT_201s0011g01530.1 Vitis_viniferaPcy_Procy01g08510 Protea_cynaroidesAam_Acora.04G142900.1 Acorus_americanus```A more complex plot can be made by add the flag `--plotelmm` such that the ELMM mixture modeling of provided paranome *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; can be superimposed, using the command below.```wgd viz -d wgd_globalmrbh_ks/global_MRBH.tsv.ks.tsv --extraparanomeks wgd_ksd/Aquilegia_coerulea.tsv.ks.tsv -sp speciestree.nw --reweight -ap wgd_syn/iadhore-out/anchorpoints.txt -o wgd_viz_mixed_Ks_elmm --spair &quot;Aquilegia_coerulea;Protea_cynaroides&quot; --spair &quot;Aquilegia_coerulea;Vitis_vinifera&quot; --spair &quot;Aquilegia_coerulea;Acorus_americanus&quot; --spair &quot;Aquilegia_coerulea;Aquilegia_coerulea&quot; --gsmap gene_species.map --plotkde --plotelmm```![](data/Aquilegia_coerulea_GlobalmrbhKs_Elmm_Corrected.ksd.svg)From the mixed *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; plot above, we can see that the optimized lognormal component b with mode 1.2 is younger than the corrected orthologous *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; mode with *Protea cynaroides* and *Vitis vinifera* (1.39 and 1.47, respectively).Besides, we can also add the GMM mixture modeling of anchor *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; values with the flag `--plotapgmm`, using the command below.```wgd viz -d wgd_globalmrbh_ks/global_MRBH.tsv.ks.tsv --extraparanomeks wgd_ksd/Aquilegia_coerulea.tsv.ks.tsv -sp speciestree.nw --reweight -ap wgd_syn/iadhore-out/anchorpoints.txt -o wgd_viz_mixed_Ks_elmm --spair &quot;Aquilegia_coerulea;Protea_cynaroides&quot; --spair &quot;Aquilegia_coerulea;Vitis_vinifera&quot; --spair &quot;Aquilegia_coerulea;Acorus_americanus&quot; --spair &quot;Aquilegia_coerulea;Aquilegia_coerulea&quot; --gsmap gene_species.map --plotkde --plotapgmmm```![](data/Aquilegia_coerulea_GlobalmrbhKs_Apgmm_Corrected.ksd.svg)As manifested above, the anchor *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; component 2 with mode 1.28 is also younger than the corrected orthologous *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; mode with *Protea cynaroides* and *Vitis vinifera*. But we need to be of course cautious that such distinction comes with the uncertainties introduced from the applied mixture modeling methodology in terms of for instance different initialization points and the issue of overfitting and the sister speciess adopted in that there might be species with more disparate substitution rates than the one we chose.Adding both ELMM result for paranome and GMM result for anchor *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; can be achieved just by add the two flags mentioned above, using the command below.```wgd viz -d wgd_globalmrbh_ks/global_MRBH.tsv.ks.tsv --extraparanomeks wgd_ksd/Aquilegia_coerulea.tsv.ks.tsv -sp speciestree.nw --reweight -ap wgd_syn/iadhore-out/anchorpoints.txt -o wgd_viz_mixed_Ks_elmm --spair &quot;Aquilegia_coerulea;Protea_cynaroides&quot; --spair &quot;Aquilegia_coerulea;Vitis_vinifera&quot; --spair &quot;Aquilegia_coerulea;Acorus_americanus&quot; --spair &quot;Aquilegia_coerulea;Aquilegia_coerulea&quot; --gsmap gene_species.map --plotkde --plotelmm --plotapgmmm```![](data/Aquilegia_coerulea_GlobalmrbhKs_Elmm_Apgmm_Corrected.ksd.svg)An alternative way to calculate the orthologous *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; is to directly use the orthogroups instead of global MRBH family. That way we don't use the pre-inferred paranome *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; but the paralogous gene pairs inside each orthogroup instead. To achieve that, we first need to infer orthogroups using the command below.```wgd dmd Aquilegia_coerulea Protea_cynaroides Acorus_americanus Vitis_vinifera --orthoinfer -o wgd_ortho (--onlyortho) ```Users can decide to only conduct the orthogroup analysis while skipping other analysis by adding the flag `--onlyortho`. Next step is the same with global MRBH family except that we don't use the extra pre-inferred paranome *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; anymore. We infer the *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; using the command below. Note that the program `wgd viz` can plot the same just as shown above.```wgd ksd wgd_ortho/Orthogroups.sp.tsv -sp speciestree.nw --reweight -o wgd_ortho_ks --spair &quot;Aquilegia_coerulea;Protea_cynaroides&quot; --spair &quot;Aquilegia_coerulea;Vitis_vinifera&quot; --spair &quot;Aquilegia_coerulea;Acorus_americanus&quot; --spair &quot;Aquilegia_coerulea;Aquilegia_coerulea&quot; --plotkde (-ap wgd_syn/iadhore-out/anchorpoints.txt)```![](data/Aquilegia_coerulea_OrthoKs_Corrected.ksd.svg)As shown above, the number of both paralogous gene pairs and orthologous gene pairs is different than the one from global MRBH family in that here we plotted all orthologous gene pairs instead of only global MRBH and potentially new paralogous gene pairs might be produced in the orthogroup inference step, together with different recalculated weights.If one only wanted to plot the orthologous *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; distribution, as we have already shown above, it can be easily achieved by removing the paralogous species pair `Aquilegia_coerulea;Aquilegia_coerulea`, using the command below.```wgd viz -d wgd_globalmrbh_ks/global_MRBH.tsv.ks.tsv -sp speciestree.nw --reweight -o wgd_globalmrbh_onlyortho_ks --spair &quot;Aquilegia_coerulea;Protea_cynaroides&quot; --spair &quot;Aquilegia_coerulea;Vitis_vinifera&quot; --spair &quot;Aquilegia_coerulea;Acorus_americanus&quot; --gsmap gene_species.map```We can clearly see that *Vitis vinifera* has higher substitution rate than *Protea cynaroides* in that their orthologous *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; peaks with *Aquilegia coerulea*, although representing the same divergence event, differed in substitution distance.![](data/Raw_Orthologues.ksd.svg)After the phylogenetic timing of the Ranunculales WGD, we can further infer its absolute age. First we infer the credible range of anchor pairs by *K*&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; heuristically using the program `wgd peak`.```wgd peak --heuristic wgd_ksd/Aquilegia_coerulea.tsv.ks.tsv -ap wgd_syn/iadhore-out/anchorpoints.txt -sm wgd_syn/iadhore-out/segments.txt -le wgd_syn/iadhore-out/list_elements.txt -mp wgd_syn/iadhore-out/multiplicon_pairs.txt -o wgd_peak```![](data/AnchorKs_PeakCI_Aquilegia_coerulea.tsv.ks.tsv_node_weighted.svg)As shown above, we assumed a lognormal distribution at the peak location detected by the `signal` module of `scipy` library. The 95% confidence level of the lognormal distribution was applied, i.e., 0.68-2.74, in further molecular dating. The file `Aquilegia_coerulea.tsv.ks.tsv_95%CI_AP_for_dating_weighted_format.tsv` is what we need for next step. To build the orthogroups used in phylogenetic dating, we need to select some species and form a starting tree with proper fossil calibrations. We provide one in mcmctree format as below.```17 1((((Potamogeton_acutifolius,(Spirodela_intermedia,Amorphophallus_konjac)),(Acanthochlamys_bracteata,(Dioscorea_alata,Dioscorea_rotundata))'&gt;0.5600&lt;1.2863')'&gt;0.8360&lt;1.2863',(Acorus_americanus,Acorus_tatarinowii))'&gt;0.8360&lt;1.2863',((((Tetracentron_sinense,Trochodendron_aralioides),(Buxus_austroyunnanensis,Buxus_sinica))'&gt;1.1080&lt;1.2863',(Nelumbo_nucifera,(Telopea_speciosissima,Protea_cynaroides)))'&gt;1.1080&lt;1.2863',(Aquilegia_coerulea_ap1,Aquilegia_coerulea_ap2))'&gt;1.1080&lt;1.2863')'&gt;1.2720&lt;2.4720';```As presented above, the focus species that is about to be dated needs to be replaced with `(Aquilegia_coerulea_ap1,Aquilegia_coerulea_ap2)`. With this starting tree and predownloaded cds files of all the species, we can build the orthogroup used in the final molecular dating using the command as below.```wgd dmd -f Aquilegia_coerulea -ap wgd_peak/Aquilegia_coerulea.tsv.ks.tsv_95%CI_AP_for_dating_weighted_format.tsv -o wgd_dmd_ortho Potamogeton_acutifolius Spirodela_intermedia Amorphophallus_konjac Acanthochlamys_bracteata Dioscorea_alata Dioscorea_rotundata Acorus_americanus Acorus_tatarinowii Tetracentron_sinense Trochodendron_aralioides Buxus_austroyunnanensis Buxus_sinica Nelumbo_nucifera Telopea_speciosissima Protea_cynaroides Aquilegia_coerulea```The result file `merge_focus_ap.tsv` is what we need for the final step of molecular dating in program `wgd focus`.```wgd focus --protdating --aamodel lg wgd_dmd_ortho/merge_focus_ap.tsv -sp dating_tree.nw -o wgd_dating -d mcmctree -ds 'burnin = 2000' -ds 'sampfreq = 1000' -ds 'nsample = 20000' Potamogeton_acutifolius Spirodela_intermedia Amorphophallus_konjac Acanthochlamys_bracteata Dioscorea_alata Dioscorea_rotundata Acorus_americanus Acorus_tatarinowii Tetracentron_sinense Trochodendron_aralioides Buxus_austroyunnanensis Buxus_sinica Nelumbo_nucifera Telopea_speciosissima Protea_cynaroides Aquilegia_coerulea```Here we only implemented the concatenation analysis using protein sequence by adding the flag `--protdating` and we set the parameter for `mcmctree` via the option `-ds`. Note that other dating program such as `r8s` and `beast` are also available given some mandatory parameters. The final log of the successful run is as below.```16:04:25 INFO     Running mcmctree using Hessian matrix of LG+Gamma  core.py:967                  for protein model23:49:37 INFO     Posterior mean for the ages of wgd is 1.128945 mcmctree.py:296                  billion years from Concatenated peptide                  alignment and 95% credibility intervals (CI)                  is 1.01224-1.23121 billion years         INFO     Total run time: 29175s                              cli.py:241         INFO     Done                                                cli.py:242```To visualize the date, we also provided a python script to plot the WGD dates in the `wgd` folder. Users need to extract the raw dates from the `mcmc.txt` for the WGD node first and save it as file `dates.txt` (or whatever preferred name). An example command is as below.```python $PATH/postplot.py postdis dates.txt --percentile 90 --title &quot;WGD date&quot; --hpd -o &quot;Ranunculales_WGD_date.svg&quot;```![](data/Ranunculales_WGD_date.svg)The posterior mean, median and mode of the Ranunculales WGD age is 112.92, 113.44 and 112.54 mya, with 90% HPD 105.07 - 122.32 mya as manifested above.## Citation Please cite us at https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty915```Arthur Zwaenepoel, Yves Van de Peer, wgd—simple command line tools for the analysis of ancient whole-genome duplications, Bioinformatics, Volume 35, Issue 12, June 2019, Pages 2153–2155, https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty915Hengchi Chen, Arthur Zwaenepoel (2023).

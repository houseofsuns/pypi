It aggregates them into entriesin a CHANGELOG file.Getting Started===============Scriv writes changelog fragments into a directory called &quot;changelog.d&quot;.  Startby creating this directory.  (By the way, like many aspects of scriv'soperation, you can choose a different name for this directory.)To make a new changelog fragment, use the ``scriv create`` command.  It willmake a new file with a filename using the current date and time, your GitHub orGit user name, and your branch name.  Changelog fragments should be committedalong with all the other changes on your branch.When it is time to release your project, the ``scriv collect`` commandaggregates all the fragments into a new entry in your changelog file.Documentation=============Full documentation is at https://scriv.readthedocs.org.License=======The code in this repository is licensed under the Apache Software License 2.0unless otherwise noted.Please see ``LICENSE.txt`` for details.How To Contribute=================Contributions are very welcome... |pypi-badge| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/scriv.svg    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scriv/    :alt: PyPI.. |ci-badge| image:: https://github.com/nedbat/scriv/workflows/Test%20Suite/badge.svg    :target: https://github.com/nedbat/scriv/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Test+Suite%22    :alt: Build status.. |coverage-badge| image:: https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/nedbat/5a304c1c779d4bcc57be95f847e9327f/raw/covbadge.json    :target: https://github.com/nedbat/scriv/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Test+Suite%22    :alt: Coverage.. |doc-badge| image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/scriv/badge/?version=latest    :target: http://scriv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/    :alt: Documentation.. |pyversions-badge| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/scriv.svg    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scriv/    :alt: Supported Python versions.. |license-badge| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/license/nedbat/scriv.svg    :target: https://github.com/nedbat/scriv/blob/master/LICENSE.txt    :alt: License.. |mastodon-nedbat| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?style=flat&amp;labelColor=450657&amp;logo=mastodon&amp;logoColor=ffffff&amp;link=https%3A%2F%2Fhachyderm.io%2F%40nedbat&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhachyderm.io%2Fusers%2Fnedbat%2Ffollowers.json&amp;query=totalItems&amp;label=Mastodon    :target: https://hachyderm.io/@nedbat    :alt: nedbat on Mastodon.. |sponsor-badge| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/%E2%9D%A4-Sponsor%20me-brightgreen?style=flat&amp;logo=GitHub    :target: https://github.com/sponsors/nedbat    :alt: Sponsor me on GitHub.. this will be appended to README.rstChangelog=========..   All enhancements and patches to scriv will be documented   in this file.  It adheres to the structure of http://keepachangelog.com/ ,   but in reStructuredText instead of Markdown (for ease of incorporation into   Sphinx documentation and the PyPI description).   This project adheres to Semantic Versioning (http://semver.org/).Unreleased----------See the fragment files in the `changelog.d directory`_... _changelog.d directory: https://github.com/nedbat/scriv/tree/master/changelog.d.. scriv-insert-here.. _changelog-1.3.1:1.3.1 — 2023-04-16------------------Fixed.....- The Version class introduced in 1.3.0 broke the ``scriv github-release``  command.  This is now fixed... _changelog-1.3.0:1.3.0 — 2023-04-16------------------Added.....- ``.cfg`` files can now be read with ``literal:`` settings, thanks to `Matias  Guijarro &lt;pull 88_&gt;`_... _pull 88: https://github.com/nedbat/scriv/pull/88Fixed.....- In compliance with `PEP 440`_, comparing version numbers now ignores a  leading &quot;v&quot; character.  This makes scriv more flexible about how you present  version numbers in various places (code literals, changelog entries, git  tags, and so on).  Fixes `issue 89`_... _PEP 440: https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/.. _issue 89: https://github.com/nedbat/scriv/issues/89.. _changelog-1.2.1:1.2.1 — 2023-02-18------------------Fixed.....- Scriv would fail trying to import tomllib on Python &lt;3.11 if installed  without the ``[toml]`` extra.  This is now fixed, closing `issue 80`_.- Settings specified as ``file:`` will now search in the changelog directory  and then the current directory for the file.  The only exception is if the  first component is ``.`` or ``..``, then only the current directory is  considered.  Fixes `issue 82`_.- Python variables with type annotations can now be read with ``literal:``  settings, fixing `issue 85`_.- Error messages for mis-formed ``literal:`` configuration values are more  precise, as requested in `issue 84`_.- Error messages from settings validation are ScrivExceptions now, and report  configuration problems more clearly and earlier in some cases... _issue 80: https://github.com/nedbat/scriv/issues/80.. _issue 82: https://github.com/nedbat/scriv/issues/82.. _issue 84: https://github.com/nedbat/scriv/issues/84.. _issue 85: https://github.com/nedbat/scriv/issues/85.. _changelog-1.2.0:1.2.0 — 2023-01-18------------------Added.....- ``scriv github-release`` now has a ``--repo=`` option to specify which GitHub  repo to use when you have multiple remotes.Changed.......- Improved the error messages from ``scriv github-release`` when a GitHub repo  can't be identified among the git remotes... _changelog-1.1.0:1.1.0 — 2023-01-16------------------Added.....- The ``scriv github-release`` command has a new setting, ``ghrel_template``.  This is a template to use when building the release text, to add text before  or after the Markdown extracted from the changelog.- The ``scriv github-release`` command now has a ``--dry-run`` option to show  what would happen, without posting to GitHub.Changed.......- File names specified for ``file:`` settings will be interpreted relative to  the current directory if they have path components.  If the file name has no  slashes or backslashes, then the old behavior remains: the file will be found  in the fragment directory, or as a built-in template.- All exceptions raised by Scriv are now ScrivException.Fixed.....- Parsing changelogs now take the `insert-marker` setting into account. Only  content after the insert-marker line is parsed.- More internal activities are logged, to help debug operations... _changelog-1.0.0:1.0.0 — 2022-12-03------------------Added.....- Now literal configuration settings can be read from YAML files. Closes `issue 69`_.  Thanks, `Florian Küpper &lt;pull 70_&gt;`_... _pull 70: https://github.com/nedbat/scriv/pull/70.. _issue 69: https://github.com/nedbat/scriv/issues/69Fixed.....- Fixed truncated help summaries by shortening them, closing `issue 63`_... _issue 63: https://github.com/nedbat/scriv/issues/63.. _changelog-0.17.0:0.17.0 — 2022-09-18-------------------Added.....- The ``collect`` command now has a ``--title=TEXT`` option to provide the  exact text to use as the title of the new changelog entry.  Finishes `issue  48`_... _issue 48: https://github.com/nedbat/scriv/issues/48Changed.......- The ``github_release`` command now only considers the top-most entry in the  changelog.  You can use the ``--all`` option to continue the old behavior of  making or updating GitHub releases for all of the entries.  This change makes it easier for projects to start using scriv with an  existing populated changelog file.  Closes `issue 57`_... _issue 57: https://github.com/nedbat/scriv/issues/57Fixed.....- If there were no fragments to collect, `scriv collect` would make a new empty  section in the changelog.  This was wrong, and is now fixed. Now the  changelog remains unchanged in this case.  Closes `issue 55`_... _issue 55: https://github.com/nedbat/scriv/issues/55- The ``github-release`` command will now issue a warning for changelog entries  that have no version number. These can't be made into releases, so they are  skipped.  (`issue 56`_)... _issue 56: https://github.com/nedbat/scriv/issues/56- ``scriv collect`` will end with an error now if the version number would  duplicate a version number on an existing changelog entry. Fixes `issue 26`_... _issue 26: https://github.com/nedbat/scriv/issues/26.. _changelog-0.16.0:0.16.0 — 2022-07-24-------------------Added.....- The ``github_release`` command will use a GitHub personal access token stored  in the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable, or from a .netrc file.Fixed.....- The github_release command was using `git tags` as a command when it should  have used `git tag`.- Anchors in the changelog were being included in the previous sections when  creating GitHub releases.  This has been fixed, closing `issue 53`_... _issue 53: https://github.com/nedbat/scriv/issues/53.. _changelog-0.15.2:0.15.2 — 2022-06-18-------------------Fixed.....- Quoted commands failed, so we couldn't determine the GitHub remote... _changelog-0.15.1:0.15.1 — 2022-06-18-------------------Added.....- Added docs for ``scriv github-release``.Fixed.....- Call pandoc properly on Windows for the github_release command... _changelog-0.15.0:0.15.0 — 2022-04-24-------------------Removed.......- Dropped support for Python 3.6.Added.....- The `github-release` command parses the changelog and creates GitHub releases  from the entries.  Changed entries will update the corresponding release.- Added a ``--version`` option.Changed.......- Parsing of fragments now only attends to the top-level section headers, and  includes nested headers instead of splitting on all headers... _changelog-0.14.0:0.14.0 — 2022-03-23-------------------Added.....- Add an anchor before each version section in the output of ``scriv collect``  so URLs for the sections are predictable and stable for each new version  (Fixes `issue 46`_). Thanks Abhilash Raj and Rodrigo Girão Serrão.Fixed.....- Markdown fragments weren't combined properly. Now they are. Thanks Rodrigo  Girão Serrão... _issue 46: https://github.com/nedbat/scriv/issues/460.13.0 — 2022-01-23-------------------Added.....-   Support finding version information in TOML files (like ``pyproject.toml``)    using the ``literal`` configuration directive.  Thanks, Kurt McKee0.12.0 — 2021-07-28-------------------Added.....- Fragment files in the fragment directory will be skipped if they match the  new configuration value ``skip_fragments``, a glob pattern.  The default  value is &quot;README.*&quot;. This lets you put a README.md file in that directory to  explain its purpose, as requested in `issue 40`_... _issue 40: https://github.com/nedbat/scriv/issues/40Changed.......- Switched from &quot;toml&quot; to &quot;tomli&quot; for reading TOML files.Fixed.....- Setting ``format=md`` didn't properly cascade into other default settings,  leaving you with RST settings that needed to be explicitly overridden  (`issue 39`_).  This is now fixed... _issue 39: https://github.com/nedbat/scriv/issues/390.11.0 — 2021-06-22-------------------Added.....- A new poorly documented API is available.  See the Scriv, Changelog, and  Fragment classes in the scriv.scriv module.Changed.......- Python 3.6 is now the minimum supported Python version.Fixed.....- The changelog is now always written as UTF-8, regardless of the default  encoding of the system.  Thanks, Hei (yhlam).0.10.0 — 2020-12-27-------------------Added.....- Settings can now be read from a pyproject.toml file.  Install with the  &quot;[toml]&quot; extra to be sure TOML support is available.  Closes `issue 9`_... _issue 9: https://github.com/nedbat/scriv/issues/9- Added the Philosophy section of the docs.Changed.......- The default entry header no longer puts the version number in square  brackets: this was a misunderstanding of the keepachangelog formatting.- Respect the existing newline style of changelog files. (`#14`_)  This means that a changelog file with Linux newlines on a Windows platform  will be updated with Linux newlines, not rewritten with Windows newlines.  Thanks, Kurt McKee... _#14: https://github.com/nedbat/scriv/issues/14Fixed.....- Support Windows' directory separator (``\``) in unit test output. (`#15`_)  This allows the unit tests to run in Windows environments. Thanks, Kurt  McKee.- Explicitly specify the directories and files that Black should scan. (`#15`_)  This prevents Black from scanning every file in a virtual environment.  Thanks, Kurt McKee.- Using &quot;literal:&quot; values in the configuration file didn't work on Python 3.6  or 3.7, as reported in `issue 18`_.  This is now fixed... _#15: https://github.com/nedbat/scriv/issues/15.. _issue 18: https://github.com/nedbat/scriv/issues/180.9.2 — 2020-08-29------------------- Packaging fix.0.9.0 — 2020-08-29------------------Added.....- Markdown format is supported, both for fragments and changelog entries.- Fragments can be mixed (some .rst and some .md). They will be collected and  output in the format configured in the settings.- Documentation.- &quot;python -m scriv&quot; now works.Changed.......- The version number is displayed in the help message.0.8.1 — 2020-08-09------------------Added.....- When editing a new fragment during &quot;scriv create&quot;, if the edited fragment has  no content (only comments or blank lines), then the create operation will be  aborted, and the file will be removed. (Closes `issue 2`_.).. _issue 2: https://github.com/nedbat/scriv/issues/2Changed.......- If the fragment directory doesn't exist, a simple direct message is shown,  rather than a misleading FileNotFound error (closes `issue 1`_)... _issue 1: https://github.com/nedbat/scriv/issues/1Fixed.....- When not using categories, comments in fragment files would be copied to the  changelog file (`issue 3`_).  This is now fixed... _issue 3: https://github.com/nedbat/scriv/issues/3- RST syntax is better understood, so that hyperlink references and directives  will be preserved. Previously, they were mistakenly interpreted as comments  and discarded.0.8.0 — 2020-08-04------------------Added.....- Added the `collect` command.- Configuration is now read from setup.cfg or tox.ini.- A new configuration setting, rst_section_char, determines the character used  in the underlines for the section headings in .rst files.- The `new_entry_template` configuration setting is the name of the template  file to use when creating new entries.  The file will be found in the  `fragment_directory` directory.  The file name defaults to ``new_entry.FMT.j2``.  If the file doesn't exist, an internal default will be used.- Now the collect command also includes a header for the entire entry.  The  underline is determined by the &quot;rst_header_char&quot; settings.  The heading text  is determined by the &quot;header&quot; setting, which defaults to the current date.- The categories list in the config can be empty, meaning entries are not  categorized.- The create command now accepts --edit (to open the new entry in your text  editor), and --add (to &quot;git add&quot; the new entry).- The collect command now accepts --edit (to open the changelog file in an  editor after the new entries have been collected) and --add (to git-add the  changelog file and git rm the entries).- The names of the main git branches are configurable as &quot;main_branches&quot; in the  configuration file.  The default is &quot;master&quot;, &quot;main&quot;, and &quot;develop&quot;.- Configuration values can now be read from files by prefixing them with  &quot;file:&quot;.  File names will be interpreted relative to the changelog.d  directory, or will be found in a few files installed with scriv.- Configuration values can interpolate the currently configured format (rst or  md) with &quot;${config:format}&quot;.- The default value for new templates is now  &quot;file: new_entry.${config:format}.j2&quot;.- Configuration values can be read from string literals in Python code with a  &quot;literal:&quot; prefix.- &quot;version&quot; is now a configuration setting.  This will be most useful when used  with the &quot;literal:&quot; prefix.- By default, the title of collected changelog entries includes the version if  it's defined.- The collect command now accepts a ``--version`` option to set the version  name used in the changelog entry title.Changed.......- RST now uses minuses instead of equals.- The `create` command now includes the time as well as the date in the entry  file name.- The --delete option to collect is now called --keep, and defaults to False.  By default, the collected entry files are removed.- Created file names now include the seconds from the current time.- &quot;scriv create&quot; will refuse to overwrite an existing entry file.- Made terminology more uniform: files in changelog.d are &quot;fragments.&quot;  When  collected together, they make one changelog &quot;entry.&quot;- The title text for the collected changelog entry is now created from the  &quot;entry_title_template&quot; configuration setting.  It's a Jinja2 template.- Combined the rst_header_char and rst_section_char settings into one:  rst_header_chars, which much be exactly two characters.- Parsing RST fragments is more flexible: the sections can use any valid RST  header characters for the underline.  Previously, it had to match the  configured RST header character.Fixed.....- Fragments with no category header were being dropped if categories were in  use.  This is now fixed.  Uncategorized fragments get sorted before any  categorized fragments.0.1.0 — 2019-12-30------------------* Doesn't really do anything yet.</longdescription>

They are both    located in the directory etc/ecscmdb, which is relative to the    virtualenv directory ecscmdb was installed in.  The config files    can be in yaml, toml, or json formats.  Only yaml format will be    used in this documentation.  The two config files are cmdb.yml and    filter.yml.### cmdb.yml    cmdb.yml is a yaml file. The yaml file can have multiple &quot;config&quot;     sections defined within it.  There must be at lease one config section.    Each config secion has the following fields:        name:       The name of the config section.    pw:         The location of the cmdb password file relative to                 virtualenv base directory cmdb was installed in.    log_level:  The python log level cmdb will run at.  Must be one of                 DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL, or TRACE.    log_dir:    The location of the cmdb log directory relative to                 virtualenv base directory cmdb was installed in.     OME_Login:  The User ID of the OpenManage server that will be used                 to gather the data.    poolsize:   The number of python ProcessPoolExecutor pools that will                be used to gather the OpenManage data.    filter:     The location of the cmdb filter file.  The filter                file, explained in detail below, scans the incoming                OpenManage, and only stores the required columns and                rows of the data.          output:     The location of the cmdb output file that the cmdb                 spreadsheet will be written to.  The name of the file can                include the jinja2 variable &quot;{{ TOD }}&quot; to include the                 current date and time.    In addition to the config section(s), the yaml file also must include     the yaml variable &quot;section:&quot; which indicates which of the config sections    to process.### cmdb.yml example file```Here is an example cmdb.yml file with two config sections.  Because the&quot;section:&quot; variable is set to 2 in this example the second section, with name &quot;Configuration file Testing&quot;, will be used.---section: 2config:  - name: Configuration file Production.    pw: etc/ecscmdb/cmdb.pw    log_level: warning    log_dir: log    OME_Login: cmdb    poolsize: 12    filter: etc/ecscmdb/filter.yml    output: output/OpenManage-cmdb.{{ TOD }}.xlsx  - name: Configuration file Testing.    pw: etc/ecscmdb/cmdb.pw    log_level: TRACE    log_dir: log    OME_Login: cmdb    poolsize: 24    filter: etc/ecscmdb/filter.yml    output: output/OpenManage-test-cmdb.{{ TOD }}.xlsx...```### filter.yml    filter.yml is a yaml file. The yaml file can have multiple &quot;config&quot;     sections defined within it.  There must be at lease one config section.    Each config secion has the following fields:        name:           The name of the config section.        column_header:  The name of the column used to match the &quot;row&quot; labels.        rename_columns: A dictionary of &quot;Old Name&quot;: &quot;New Name&quot; used to rename                    Column lines.        sort_columns:   A list of column names to sort the each worksheet with.        filters:        A list of Row:Columns:Update to include from the                     OpenManage database into each created worksheet.  The                    Update option is optional.        Row:        The names of the row to look for matching columns in                    within the OpenManage database data.        Columns:    A list of matching Columns names for the given Row to                    include.        Update:     A dictional entry of &quot;Column Name&quot;: &quot;Function Name&quot;.                    If the Column Name is part of the data precented from                    the OpenManage database, then the cell for Row:Column                    will be modified using the Function Name provided.                    The Function is defined in the python library                    updatecells.py that is part of the ECScmdb packages.                    This should be the only python library that needs to                    be modified.    In addition to the config section(s), the yaml file also must    include the yaml variable &quot;section:&quot; which indicates which of the    config sections to process.### filter.yml example file```Here is an example filter.yml file with one config section.  Because the&quot;section:&quot; variable is set to 1 in this example the first section, with name &quot;Partial&quot;, will be used.---section: 1config:  - name: Partial    column_header: InventoryType    rename_columns:      Ports: &quot;Mac Address&quot;    sort_columns:      - InventoryType      - DeviceDescription      - DeviceName      - InstanceId      - NicId      - CapabilityType.CapabilityId      - CapabilityType.Description      - CapabilityType.IdOwner      - CapabilityType.Name      - DiskNumber      - DnsName      - EndDate      - EntitlementId      - Id      - IdOwner      - LicenseDescription      - LicenseType.LicenseId      - LicenseType.Name      - Name      - Number      - SasAddress      - SerialNumber      - ServiceTag      - SlotNumber      - SoldDate    filters:      -        row: serverProcessors        columns:          - InstanceId          - InventoryType          - ModelName          - NumberOfCores      -        row: serverFcCards        columns:          - DeviceDescription          - DeviceName          - InventoryType          - VirtualWwn          - VirtualWwpn          - Wwn          - Wwpn      -        row: serverOperatingSystems        columns:          - Hostname          - InventoryType          - OsName      -        row: serverArrayDisks        columns:          - BusType          - DiskNumber          - InventoryType          - MediaType          - ModelNumber          - SerialNumber          - Size      -        row: serverMemoryDevices        columns:          - DeviceDescription          - InstanceId          - InventoryType          - ManufacturerDate          - Name          - SerialNumber          - Size          - Speed          - TypeDetails      -        row: serverNetworkInterfaces        columns:          - InventoryType          - NicId          - Ports        update:          Ports: update_ports      -        row: chassisSlotsList        columns:          - DnsName          - InventoryType          - Model          - Name          - Number          - Occupied          - ServiceTag      -        row: chassisControllerList        columns:          - InventoryType          - Name      -        row: deviceManagement        columns:          - DnsName          - EndPointAgents          - InstrumentationName          - InventoryType          - IpAddress          - MacAddress          - ManagementId          - ManagementType.Description          - ManagementType.Name        update:          EndPointAgents: update_end_point_agents      -        row: nicInformation        columns:          - Description          - DeviceId          - InventoryType          - Ipv4_address          - Mac_address          - Subnet_mask...```### cmdb.pw    cmdb.pw is a python AES encripted password file.  It must contain the    following two entries:     1. A key that matches the OME_Login variable from the cmdb.yml       file. The value of the entry is the password for that user.    2. A key named &quot;OMEHost&quot; (case-sensitive string).  The value of       the entry is the URL for the OpenManage host.### Adding or updating an entry in the cmdb.pw file    Execute &quot;cmdb --add=STRING&quot;, where STRING is the key to be created    or updated.  cmdb will then prompt for the value for the given    key.  The entries are encripted and stored in the cmdb.pw file.### Example     # cmdb --add=xyzzy    Enter password for user 'xyzzy':    #### Deleting an entry from the cmdb.pw file    Execute &quot;cmdb --delete=STRING&quot;, where STRING is the key to be    deleted.  The entries will be deleted without prompting.### Example    # cmdb --delete=xyzzy    #### List the keys or keys/values stored n the cmdb.pw file    Execute &quot;cmdb --list&quot; to list all of the keys in the cmdb.pw file,    or &quot;cmdb --list --verbose&quot; to list both the keys and the values    for each key.### Examples    # cmdb --list    # cmdb --list --verbose## cmdbdiff    Before cmdbdiff can be used to compare two OpenManage    spreadsheets, created using the cmdb command, the file    cmdbdiff.yml must be created.  This file is located in the    directory etc/ecscmdb, which is relative to the virtualenv    directory ecscmdb was installed in.### cmdbdiff.yml    cmdbdiff.yml is a yaml file. The yaml file can have multiple    &quot;config&quot; sections defined within it.  There must be at least one    config section in it.  In addition to the config section(s), the    yaml file also must include the yaml variable &quot;section:&quot; which    indicates which of the config sections to process.st be at lease    one config section.  Each config secion has the following fields:    name:                       The name of the configuration section                                 (optional).    admin:                      The Admin managing cmdbdiff.        name:                   The Admin name.        email:                  The Admin email address.        phone:                  The Admin phone number.    log_level:                  The python log level cmdb will run at.

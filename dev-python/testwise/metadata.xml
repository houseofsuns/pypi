Difficult to comprehend. I tried to explain the use of the library with examples as best I could. But writing such automation is quite complex.There may still be errors. It is pretty difficult to check but I'm trying to improve the usage.## Example Usage```python# Testwise is a backtester library that requires some coding knowledge# There is no cli or interface. # You should directly execute necessary functions like enter_long() or exit_short()# This is a backtesting example of Exponential Moving Average cross strategy.# There is a 1.5 ATR stop loss level and a 1 ATR take profit level for every position. # Commission rate is 0.1000%. # Margin usage is allowed up to 5 times the main capital.from datetime import datetime, timedeltafrom testwise import Testwiseimport requestsfrom legitindicators import ema, atr# In this example, daily BTCUSDT kline data is used from binance# Let's say you want to backtest your strategy for about 450 days.# It would be useful to add some extra days to the specified time interval# for the indicators to work properly.# (For example 10 days of EMA won't be calculated for the first 9 days of time range)# In this example I add 40 extra days. This value can be determined by assigning the TRIM variableTRIM = 40BINANCE_URL = &quot;https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines&quot;SYMBOL = &quot;BTCUSDT&quot;INTERVAL = &quot;1d&quot;# These are the initial paramters for backtester.# You can find a more detailed explanation where the Testwise definition is given below.COMMISSION = 0.001DYNAMIC_POSITIONING = TrueMARGIN_FACTOR = 5LIMIT_FACTOR = 1RISK_FACTOR = 1.5def main():    # Here we define the start time and end time of backtesting.    # Notice usage of TRIM variable to start to backtest a few days earlier for proper indicator use.    start_time = datetime(2020, 6, 1, 0, 0, 0)    start_time = start_time - timedelta(days=TRIM)    end_time = datetime(2021, 9, 1, 0, 0, 0)    # In this example, timestamps are used.

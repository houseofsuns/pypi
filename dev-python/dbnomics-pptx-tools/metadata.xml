	<longdescription># DBnomics PowerPoint (pptx) toolsThis CLI tool allows to update data coming from DBnomics in PowerPoint presentations.## UsageFirst, define a YAML metadata file describing the charts and tables on each slide to update.For example see [simple_presentation_1.yaml](./samples/simple_presentation_1.yaml).See the [metadata file](#metadata-file) section below for more details.The `dbnomics-pptx` CLI command provides 2 commands: `fetch` and `update`.### `fetch` commandThis command reads all the series needed by the charts and tables of all slides in the YAML metadata file, deduplicate and download them in a cache directory, where they are stored as JSON files.```bashdbnomics-pptx fetch samples/simple_presentation_1.yaml```Use the `-v` option to display debug messages.By default, the series that are already present in the cache directory are skipped, in order to avoid putting pressure on DBnomics servers.Use the `--force` option to always download them.### `update` commandThis command takes a PowerPoint presentation file in input, and a YAML metadata file, and updates the charts and tables defined in the metadata file, then saves the result in an output presentation file (it does not modify the input one).```bashdbnomics-pptx update samples/simple_presentation_1.pptx --metadata-file samples/simple_presentation_1.yaml samples/simple_presentation_1.output.pptx```Use the `-v` option to display debug messages.## Metadata file```yamlslides:  My slide 1: # the title of the slide    charts:      My chart 1: # the name of the chart (as defined in the &quot;Selection pane&quot;)        series:          - OECD/GDP_GROWTH/W.USA.tracker_yoy # simple form: the series ID          - id: OECD/GDP_GROWTH/W.Eurozone.tracker_yoy # extended form: a map of the ID and the name of the series            name: Eurozone    tables:      My table 1: # the name of the table (as defined in the &quot;Selection pane&quot;)        series:          - OECD/KEI/NAEXKP01.EA19.GP.A          - OECD/KEI/NAEXKP01.DEU.GP.A          - OECD/KEI/NAEXKP01.FRA.GP.A          - OECD/KEI/NAEXKP01.ITA.GP.Aseries: # a map of properties for series, shared between all the charts and tables of all slides  OECD/GDP_GROWTH/W.USA.tracker_yoy:    name: United States  OECD/KEI/NAEXKP01.DEU.GP.A:    name: Germany  OECD/KEI/NAEXKP01.EA19.GP.A:    name: Euro Area  OECD/KEI/NAEXKP01.FRA.GP.A:    name: France  OECD/KEI/NAEXKP01.ITA.GP.A:    name: Italy```Series properties defined in charts of tables have a higher precedence level than the ones defines in the top-level `series` map (which act as a fallback).For example, here the name of the series `OECD/GDP_GROWTH/W.Eurozone.tracker_yoy` is defined at the chart level, in &quot;My chart 1&quot; (the name is &quot;Eurozone&quot;), and it is not defined in the top-level `series` map.On the contrary, in &quot;My chart 1&quot;, the named of the series `OECD/GDP_GROWTH/W.USA.tracker_yoy` is not defined, and will be found in the top-level `series` map, where it is defined as &quot;United States&quot;.### How to know the names of the charts/tables?The names of the charts and tables can be read or modified in the &quot;Selection pane&quot; in PowerPoint.The &quot;Selection pane&quot; can be opened with Alt+F10 in PowerPoint.Then you just have to select a chart or a table, and it will highlight the corresponding line in the &quot;Selection pane&quot;, showing its name.You can also modify the name to improve readability.Once you get the name of a chart or a table, you can put it in the YAML file.In the previous example, the names are &quot;My chart 1&quot; and &quot;My table 1&quot;.See also:- [Manage objects with the Selection pane](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/manage-objects-with-the-selection-pane-a6b2fd3e-d769-46c1-9b9c-b94e04a72550)- [The PowerPoint Selection Pane](https://www.presentationpoint.com/blog/powerpoint-selection-pane/)</longdescription>

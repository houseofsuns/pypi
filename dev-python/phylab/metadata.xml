[lab]- A simple showcase of a couple of things this library allows you to do. [circfit]  - Finding the best-fitting circle and ellipse for simulated or real sampled data points.  - A quick comparison between using `curve_fit`, an algebraic circle fit   (weighted [Coope] method) and an algebraic ellipse fit.  - Plotting the $\chi^2(a, b)$ surface for a pair of parameters $a, b$ of the circle or the ellipse.- Folder containing further examples and data that can be used in the demos. [examples]For another example of where this package can come in handy feel free to checkout [FFT repository] and [Lock-in detector]. A small paper (in italiano) on fitting,computing Fourier transforms and/or simulating the effect of a Lock-in detectoron real sampled signals or internally generated ones.### model functionsA few definitions of the model functions more commonly encountered in the firstyears of Physics lab (e.g. [dampened oscillator], [square wave])along with a few digital filters (e.g. [Butterworth]).Right at the beginning of the module so you can immediately start addingthe models you need.### testing and printing of fit resultsGoodness of fit tests, evaluation of parameter uncertainties andcorrelations  ([chi-square test], [errcor]).Simple print formatters that allow you to quickly display the resultsof a fit and associated uncertainties with the desired number of significantdigits. ([print correlations], [print parameters])### curve-fitting routinesWeighted least-square fitting accounting for uncertainties on x and y axeswith linear error propagation ([propagated fit]), relying on [scipy.optimize.curve_fit].Weighted orthogonal distance regression thanks to [ODRPACK].Weighted algebraic fits (like [ellipse fit] and others).### Fourier transform utilitiesFunctions for computing FFTs of real and complex signals and otherassociated quantities ([sampling], [FFT], [FWHM]), applying window functionsand displaying their output through Matplotlib ([plotfft]).### data plottingInstead of having to write multiple calls to function in order to:activate axis minor ticks, setting their size, orientation and spacing,placing grids, setting errorbar sizes, etc.. (stuff that's present inalmost all experimental graphs)You can set some sensible defaults for plots of fitted data, so you cando all of the above in a faster and less error-prone way.([grid], [plot fit &amp;  residuals])### importing data from filesLoad a selected range of data from (.txt, .csv, .py, etc.) files as NumPyarrays, loop over files in a directory with a few calls to function([measured range], [file loop]).## Setting upThis library was written entirely in Python 3.x, but because of its entrylevel design should be effortless to readapt to Python 2.x.Should be completely OS independent.### PrerequisitesPhy lab requires three core packages from the SciPy ecosystem to work:[Numpy], [SciPy] and [Matplotlib]. You should be able to obtain all 3 via `pip````python -m pip install --user --upgrade numpy scipy matplotlib```Check [SciPy's installation page](https://www.scipy.org/install.html) for more details.### InstallationThe cleanest way to install and manage phylab is using `pip`:```python -m pip install --user phylab```Then simply import the main module with```import phylab as lab```Alternatively, you can clone the repository or download the latest releasemanually and import the main module directly inside your script just as before.## Using Phy labFor a quick guide on how to use this library and to show just how much of a differenceusing these few functions can have, compare [beat] and [beat_naive].These two scripts do the same thing, but the first one is three times shorterat 50 lines, runs ~ 0.2 seconds (30%) faster using less memory and can beeasily extended to work with more than 2 datasets, remove outliers,compute FFT and so on... As you can see for example in [beat_ext].## DevelopmentAny and all suggestions are always appreciated, If you want to contributein any way don't hesitate to contact me. I'm always happy to learn somethingnew, so if you know how to improve any part of the code, find somethingthat needs fixing or even if you'd like to see something added going forwards,feel free to let me know (here or at bernardo.tomelleri@gmail.com).## LicensePhy lab is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 or later.[//]: # (These are reference links used in the body of the readme and getstripped out by the markdown processor.See - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4823468/store-comments-in-markdown-syntax)   [lab]: &lt;https://github.com/BernardoTomelleri/phylab/blob/master/phylab/lab.py&gt;   [circfit]: &lt;https://github.com/BernardoTomelleri/phylab/blob/master/examples/circfit.py&gt;   [examples]: &lt;https://github.com/BernardoTomelleri/phylab/tree/master/examples&gt;   [FFT repository]: &lt;https://github.com/BernardoTomelleri/FFT&gt;   [Lock-in detector]: &lt;https://github.com/BernardoTomelleri/FFT/blob/master/lockin.py&gt;   [Coope]: &lt;https://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10092/11104/coope_report_no69_1992.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y&gt;   [dampened oscillator]: &lt;https://github.com/BernardoTomelleri/phylab/blob/1a4a86d121a1c07b91af5dfc7ec03443b1939035/phylab/lab.py#L58&gt;   [square wave]: &lt;https://github.com/BernardoTomelleri/phylab/blob/1a4a86d121a1c07b91af5dfc7ec03443b1939035/phylab/lab.py#L66&gt;   [Butterworth]: &lt;https://github.com/BernardoTomelleri/phylab/blob/1a4a86d121a1c07b91af5dfc7ec03443b1939035/phylab/lab.py#L131&gt;   [chi-square test]: &lt;https://github.com/BernardoTomelleri/phylab/blob/1a4a86d121a1c07b91af5dfc7ec03443b1939035/phylab/lab.py#L161&gt;   [errcor]: &lt;https://github.com/BernardoTomelleri/phylab/blob/1a4a86d121a1c07b91af5dfc7ec03443b1939035/phylab/lab.py#L292&gt;   [print correlations]: &lt;https://github.com/BernardoTomelleri/phylab/blob/1a4a86d121a1c07b91af5dfc7ec03443b1939035/phylab/lab.py#L301&gt;   [print parameters]: &lt;https://github.com/BernardoTomelleri/phylab/blob/1a4a86d121a1c07b91af5dfc7ec03443b1939035/phylab/lab.py#L308&gt;   [propagated fit]: &lt;https://github.com/BernardoTomelleri/phylab/blob/1a4a86d121a1c07b91af5dfc7ec03443b1939035/phylab/lab.py#L381&gt;   [ODRPACK]: &lt;https://docs.scipy.org/doc/external/odrpack_guide.pdf&gt;   [scipy.optimize.curve_fit]: &lt;https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.curve_fit.html&gt;   [ellipse fit]: &lt;https://github.com/BernardoTomelleri/phylab/blob/1a4a86d121a1c07b91af5dfc7ec03443b1939035/phylab/lab.py#L589&gt;   [sampling]: &lt;https://github.com/BernardoTomelleri/phylab/blob/1a4a86d121a1c07b91af5dfc7ec03443b1939035/phylab/lab.py#L836&gt;   [FFT]: &lt;https://github.com/BernardoTomelleri/phylab/blob/1a4a86d121a1c07b91af5dfc7ec03443b1939035/phylab/lab.py#L851&gt;   [FWHM]: &lt;https://github.com/BernardoTomelleri/phylab/blob/1a4a86d121a1c07b91af5dfc7ec03443b1939035/phylab/lab.py#L336&gt;   [plotfft]: &lt;https://github.com/BernardoTomelleri/phylab/blob/1a4a86d121a1c07b91af5dfc7ec03443b1939035/phylab/lab.py#L801&gt;   [grid]: &lt;https://github.com/BernardoTomelleri/phylab/blob/1a4a86d121a1c07b91af5dfc7ec03443b1939035/phylab/lab.py#L653&gt;   [plot fit &amp;  residuals]: &lt;https://github.com/BernardoTomelleri/phylab/blob/1a4a86d121a1c07b91af5dfc7ec03443b1939035/phylab/lab.py#L729&gt;   [measured range]: &lt;https://github.com/BernardoTomelleri/phylab/blob/1a4a86d121a1c07b91af5dfc7ec03443b1939035/phylab/lab.py#L902&gt;   [file loop]: &lt;https://github.com/BernardoTomelleri/phylab/blob/1a4a86d121a1c07b91af5dfc7ec03443b1939035/phylab/lab.py#L943&gt;   [SciPy]: &lt;https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html&gt;      [NumPy]: &lt;https://numpy.org/&gt;   [Matplotlib]: &lt;https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html&gt;   [beat]: &lt;https://github.com/BernardoTomelleri/phylab/blob/master/examples/beat.py&gt;   [beat_naive]: &lt;https://github.com/BernardoTomelleri/phylab/blob/master/examples/beat_naive.py&gt;   [beat_ext]: &lt;https://github.com/BernardoTomelleri/phylab/blob/master/examples/beat_ext.py&gt;</longdescription>

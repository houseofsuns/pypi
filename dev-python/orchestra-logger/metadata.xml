	<longdescription># orchestra-loggerThis is a lightweight sdk that allows Orchestra (getorchestra.io) to interact with self-hosted applications.The basic premise is for your self-hosted application to be triggerable via Orchestra, so accepts awebhook or HTTP request. Within the application, the orchestra-logger is added to send checkpoint informationto orchestra, such as whether the request was successful, whether it failed, why etc. That's it!## Quickstart - local testingFirstly, run ```pip install orchestra-logger==0.x.x```With your chosen version. The current version is 0.0.8.Next, head to orchestra_logger/example/example.py:```from orchestra_logger.orcProcess.orcProcess import orcProcessdef run_example_process(correlation_id, creds):    orcProcessInstance = orcProcess(correlation_id, creds)    print('Starting complicated process')    try:        print('Trying something complicated')        raise Exception    except Exception as e:        print('Failed to do something complicated')        orcProcessInstance.sendFailure(message = str(e), data={'some':'arbitrary stuff'})    finally:        print('Completed')        orcProcessInstance.sendCompletion(message = 'Completed')creds = {'apikey':'my_api_key'}run_example_process('hello', creds)```### Summary1. The function takes a correlation id and a dictionary called 'creds'. The correlation id is a uuid that will be passed   to the app by Orchestra when the app is triggered, and corresponds to a pipeline element / task. The creds object is a   dictionary that contains an 'apikey' key that should be securely stored and accessed via your app e.g. using a local config    file, environment variables, but ideally by interacting with a key vault2. To kick off the process, add the code ```orcProcessInstance = orcProcess(correlation_id, creds)```. This lets Orchestra   know the process has started3. Use try/except/finally logic to ensure Orchestra knows when parts of the pipeline element / task fail or succeed.   Use the methods ```sendFailure``` and ```sendCompletion``` to indicate whether stages fail. Note; arbitrary data can be   appended to status updates using the &quot;data&quot; parameter. You do not need to include status codes or times in the &quot;data&quot;   parameter; Orchestra calculates these by default.Note; it's feasible that the above structure requires relatively deep nesting of try/except logic which can lead tomuch lengthier code. It is perfectly fine to have a structure like below:```def run_something_complicated():    passdef action_on_app_trigger(correlation_id, creds):    orcProcessInstance = orcProcess(correlation_id, creds)    try:        run_something_complicated()    except BaseException as e:        orcProcessInstance.sendFailure(message = str(e), data={'some':'arbitrary stuff'})    finally:        print('Completed')        orcProcessInstance.sendCompletion(message = 'Completed')```        Which ensures that no matter what code is excecuted in ```run_something_complicated``` , Orchestra will know what happensto the job.## Quick-start; Fast APIFor Production usage, you should have an App Service that accepts HTTP requests and contains all the logic you needto carry out the pipeline/element task.Firstly, ensure there is an endpoint that can be hit / triggered by Orchestra for the task you wish to carry out:```from fastapi import Depends, FastAPIfrom services.data_ingestion import dataIngesterfrom services.creds_manager import credsManagerfrom orchestra_logger import orcProcessfrom routers import baseapp = FastAPI()app.include_router(base.router)@app.post(&quot;/kickOffIngestion&quot;)async def root(body= Body()):    creds = credsManager.get_creds()    orcProcessInstance = orcProcess(body.correlation_id, creds)    ingester__ = dataIngester()    try:        ingester__.run()    except BaseException as e:        orcProcessInstance.sendFailure(message = str(e), data={'some':'arbitrary stuff'})    finally:        print('Completed')        orcProcessInstance.sendCompletion(message = 'Completed')    return {&quot;message&quot;: &quot;Process kicked off successfully&quot;}```There are a few things happenning here:1. You have a credentials service that securely fetches your Orchestra API Key, which is being imported and handles the    generation of the ```creds``` object2. You instantiate the ```orcProcess``` by using the creds object in (1) but also by accessing the correlation ID, which   is passed to you in the body of the request usnig FastAPI's ```Body()``` function3. You nest the function call ```ingeter__.run()``` within try / except / finally to ensure Orchestra has the relevant   information to know how the task is performing4. Bonus: the code above is not actually asynchronous although the function is defined with async def, and will _only_   return the response once ```ingester.run()``` has finished running. It is good API practice to make the code execute   and return a response straightaway for Post-like requests        </longdescription>

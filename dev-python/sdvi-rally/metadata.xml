This action now returns `NotFound` error.- Fixed a bug in `asset.clear_asset_status_indicator` when attempting to use invalid indicator ids- Fixed a parsing bug in `files.delete_file` for in files found in subfolders- `asset.get_asset` now supports names with commas- Fixed a bug in `supplyChain.start_new_supply_chain` that ignored `provider_filter`- Fixed a bug in `SupplyChainStep` that ignored `provider_filter`. This action now raises an error if the supplied tagdoes not exist.---## v1.0.0 -- released 10 May 2022### Features- Rally Decision Engine and SDK is now out of Beta! 💥️ 🎉 ️🎊 ️🎉 ️💥️---## v0.2.0 -- released 01 Apr 2022### Features- **Altering a different asset is no longer allowed in Decision Engine jobs.**  Allowing the alteration of another assetcould cause unpredictable behavior as multiple jobs operated on the same asset at the same time. The best practice foraltering any asset is to launch a supply chain with that asset. The following methods have had `asset_name` removed fromtheir kwargs:  - `asset.add_asset_status_indicator`  - `asset.clear_all_asset_status_indicators`  - `supplyChain.set_scheduled_workflow`### Fixes- Fixed a bug in `supplyChain.get_scheduled_supply_chain` and `supplyChain.set_scheduled_supply_chain` that wasimproperly converting datetimes- Fixed an issue with `files.delete_file` that prevented deletion of files in Storage Location subdirectories- Various documentation fixes---## v0.1.9 -- released 18 Jan 2022### Features- Added optional `remove_date` argument to `files.RallyFile.remove_location()` method, allows the actual delete tooccur at a later date- Added `sharedDeleteAt` attribute to `RallyFile.locations`- Added optional `timeout` argument to `files.RallyFile.presigned_url()`, `files.read_file()`, `files.read_files()`methods- Add `rallyUrl` to SDK context---## v0.1.8 -- released 09 Nov 2021### Features- There is a new library available! [SDVI Rally Token Auth](https://pypi.org/project/sdvi-rally-token-auth/0.1.0/)allows users to easily access the v2 API from Decision Engine presets. Refer to preset documentation on your silo forusage.- Added `clientResourceId` attribute to return of `jobs.get_jobs_for_asset`, if present- **Asset Status Indicator methods `get_asset_status_indicators`, `add_asset_status_indicator`,`clear_asset_status_indicator`, and `clear_all_asset_status_indicators` are being promoted out of Alpha.**They will move out of the `experimental` submodule and into the `asset` submodule.Import statements will change accordingly.### Fixes- Presets can now correctly import zip packages placed in nested directories specified inRallyConfig `Eval2Package`---## v0.1.7 -- released 12 Oct 2021### Features- A new key, `rallyUrl`, has been added to the context. This is the base URL for your silo's API.- You can now find out the SDK version your silo is running:    ```python    from rally import __version__    print(__version__)    ```    OR    ```python    import rally    print(rally.__version__)    ```    Either results in &quot;0.1.7&quot;. Note that this feature is not available in prior versions of the SDK.### Fixes- `SupplyChainStep` `fail_step` argument type was incorrectly listed as being either a string or a SupplyChainStep.`fail_step` could only be the string `name` of an alternate SupplyChainStep. `fail_step` argument changed to string-type`fail_step_name`---## v0.1.6 -- released 29 Sept 2021### Features- Add support for `forced_delete` mode to `files.RallyFile.remove_location()` method. This option removes a filelocation from the asset's inventory and deletes the file even if it is referenced by another asset.- Add support for `forced_delete` mode to `files.remove_inventory()` method. This option removes a file reference fromthe asset's inventory and deletes the file locations even if they are referenced by another asset.### Fixes---## v0.1.5 -- released 31 Aug 2021### Features- Add `set_scheduled_supply_chain` to the supplyChain submodule, allowing users to schedule a supply chain for the  current asset- Add `get_scheduled_supply_chain` to the supplyChain submodule, returning a dict representation of an arbitrary asset's  scheduled supply chain### Fixes- Fix an issue with the SDK improperly handling missing environment variable---## v0.1.4 -- released 03 Aug 2021### Features- Add `presigned_url` method to `RallyFile`. This returns a presigned url for a file.- Add `asset_name` and `category` arguments to `jobs.get_jobs_for_asset` method.- Add `inputFileLabel` to dictionary returned by `jobs.get_jobs_for_asset`.- Add `fail_step` argument to `supplyChain.SupplyChainStep` creation to specify a step to execute if the next step fails.- Add `jobs.cancel_job` method to cancel a job given its UUID.- `supplyChain.set_supply_chain_metadata` now overwrites existing metadata with the new value.  This enables users to remove top-level keys.### Fixes- `supplyChain.SupplyChainSplit.add_split` param `async` has been renamed to `run_async`.---## v0.1.3 -- released 20 Jul 2021### Features- Add `asset_name` argument to `jobs.get_job_report` method. This allows users to retrieve QC or analyze data from  arbitrary assets using the supplied provider type and label.### Fixes---## v0.1.2 -- released 22 June 2021### Features- Add `files.write_files` method that offers parallel writing of files given a dict of URLs and content- Add `files.read_files` method that offers parallel reading of files given a sequence of URLs  **Caution should be used when reading multiple files**- `files.list_files` now returns both files and (subdirectories) at the specified url.- Add License-only deadline argument `step_deadline_lic_only` to `supplyChain.SupplyChainStep`- `SupplyChainSplit` and `SupplyChainCancel` can now take a `SupplyChainSequence`### Fixes- `SupplyChainStep` now correctly recognizes `provider_filter` values---## v0.1.1 -- released 16 Mar 2021### Features- Initial Beta offering.</longdescription>

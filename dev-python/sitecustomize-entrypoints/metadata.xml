Here's an example:```toml[tool.poetry.plugins.&quot;sitecustomize&quot;]&quot;my-action&quot; = &quot;my_project.action:my_action&quot;```In this example, we're registering an entrypoint called `my-action` in the `sitecustomize`-group.This entrypoint points to the `my_action`-function in the `my_project.actions`-module.Once you've registered your entrypoints, they will be executed **automatically**when the `sitecustomize`-module is imported.```pythonimport sitecustomize```## Ordering**Entrypoints are sorted by name.**The ordering in which the entrypoints are defined in your `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml`are unfortunately not the order in which they are registered internally.The entrypoints are first ordered alphanumerically by name.So defined entrypoints are re-ordered from```toml[tool.poetry.plugins.&quot;sitecustomize&quot;]foo = &quot;my_project.action:action_foo&quot;bar = &quot;my_project.action:action_bar&quot;```into```toml[tool.poetry.plugins.&quot;sitecustomize&quot;]bar = &quot;my_project.action:action_bar&quot;foo = &quot;my_project.action:action_foo&quot;```This can cause issues when there are dependencies between your entrypoints.TIP: You can use integer-prefixes to the name to enforce the ordering in which you define your entrypoints.:```toml[tool.poetry.plugins.&quot;sitecustomize&quot;]10-foo = &quot;my_project.action:action_foo&quot;20-bar = &quot;my_project.action:action_bar&quot;```## Cancel entrypoints registered by third-party packagesImagine a third-party package has registered an entrypoint as follows:```toml[tool.poetry.plugins.&quot;sitecustomize&quot;]their-action = &quot;external_module:their_action&quot;```But it does not match the ordering you'd like.You can cancel the execution of this plugin, by registering an entrypoint with the same name in your own `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml` file,and pointing to the no-action `sitecustomize.cancel`-function.```toml[tool.poetry.plugins.&quot;sitecustomize&quot;] their-action = &quot;sitecustomize:cancel&quot;```By registering an entrypoint with the **same name** it overrides the previous registered action.Subsequently you can re-register this entrypoint by a different name to change the order of execution.## Overriding and re-ordering entrypointsYou can override and re-order registered entrypoints by defining your own entrypoints with the same name in your setup.py or pyproject.toml file.When `sitecustomize` executes registered entrypoints, it uses a FIFO-approach (first in, first out):Only the last registered entrypoint with a given name is executed. Any prior entrypoints with the same name are filtered out (overriden by the last).To re-order entrypoints, you can use the `cancel`-function provided by `sitecustomize-entrypoints`.The `cancel`-function allows you to cancel out a previously registered entrypoint, so you can re-register it in a different order.Here's an example to enforce a specific order of execution:```toml[tool.poetry.plugins.&quot;sitecustomize&quot;]&quot;their-action = external_module:their_action&quot;``````toml[tool.poetry.plugins.&quot;sitecustomize&quot;]&quot;their-action = sitecustomize:cancel&quot;&quot;10-my-action = my_project.action:my_action&quot;&quot;20-their-action = external_module:their_action&quot;```In this example, we're re-ordering an entrypoint registered by a third-party module to be executed after our own.First we re-register it with the same name to override and cancel its action, and subsequently we re-register it under a different name to ensureit get executed after our own entrypoints, even if all entrypoints are sorted alphabetically## Display all registered entrypoint in order of executionThe `sitecustomize.print_entrypoints`-function provided by `sitecustomize-entrypoints` allows you to display a list of all registered entrypoints.By default, it will display all registered entrypoints in the `sitecustomize`-group in order of execution.You can optionally pass a different entrypoint group name as an argument.If you pass `filtered=True` as an argument, the function will also filter out any duplicate entrypoints and display only the last instance of each entrypoint. Here's an example usage:```pythonimport sitecustomize# Display all registered entrypoints in the sitecustomize groupsitecustomize.print_entrypoints()# More explicit equivalentsitecustomize.print_entrypoints(group_name=&quot;sitecustomize&quot;)# Display only the first instance of each registered entrypoint in the sitecustomize groupsitecustomize.print_entrypoints(filtered=True)```</longdescription>

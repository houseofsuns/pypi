Stacklog provides a single method, `stacklog`, which serves as either a decorator or acontext manager. This is exceptionally useful in small projects or one-off scripts.This is illustrated best with an example:```pythonwith stacklog(print, 'Running some code'):    with stacklog(print, 'Running some other code'):        pass```This produces the following logging output:```shellRunning some code...Running some other code...Running some other code...DONERunning some code...DONE```When the code within a stacklog context completes, the provided message is echoed along withthe return status, one of `DONE` or `FAILURE`. That's pretty much it. Customization and advanced features are available through callbacks.## Installstacklog has been developed and tested on Python 2.7 and 3.5+.```shellpip install stacklog```## QuickstartHow often do you find yourself using the following logging anti-pattern in Python?```pythonimport loggingdef a():    logging.info('Running a')    do_something()    logging.info('Done with a')def b():    logging.info('Running b')    a()    logging.info('Done with b')try:    b()except:    logging.info('There was an error running b')```The intention here is to log the beginning and end of procedure calls for use in debuggingor user monitoring. I call this an anti-pattern because:- it requires excessive manual attention to writing/updating logging calls at entry/exit sites- it results in redundant exception handling logic- the resulting log messages can be misleading if errors occurInstead, the approach taken by stacklog is to accomplish this using only decorators andcontext managers.### Usage as decoratorHere is the above example using the stacklog as a decorator:```python@stacklog(logging.info, 'Running a')def a():    raise Exception@stacklog(logging.info, 'Running b')def b():    a()b()```This produces logging output:```shellINFO:root:Running b...INFO:root:Running a...INFO:root:Running a...FAILUREINFO:root:Running b...FAILURE```### Usage as context managerHere is another example using stacklog as a context manager:```pycon&gt;&gt;&gt; with stacklog(logging.info, 'Running some code'):...     do_something()...INFO:root:Running some code...INFO:root:Running some code...DONE```### Providing custom conditionsA *condition* is a tuple `exception, status`. If the provided exception is raised during theexecution of the provided code, the provided status is logged instead of the default`FAILURE`.```pycon&gt;&gt;&gt; with stacklog(logging.info, 'Running some code', conditions=[(NotImplementedError,'SKIPPED')]):...     raise NotImplementedError...INFO:root:Running some code...INFO:root:Running some code...SKIPPED```### Customization with callbacksThe behavior of `stacklog` is fully customizable with callbacks.The main thing that a callback will do is call the passed `stacklog` instance's `log` method with some custom suffix.First, there are three callbacks to customize the behavior of logging at the beginning of the block, at successful completion of the block, and at failure of the block. Only one function can be registered at a time for each of  these events.- `on_begin(func: stacklog -&gt; None)`- `on_success(func: stacklog -&gt; None)`- `on_failure(func: stacklog -&gt; None)`Second, one can customize failure behavior given different possible exceptions that are raised, by passing a pair of functions, the first to match an exception that was raised during block execution and the second to respondto the exception. Many pairs of functions can be registered, but only the most recent one to be registered will be executed in the case that multiple functions match.- `on_condition(match: *exc_info -&gt; bool, func: stacklog, *exc_info -&gt; None)`Third, one can initialize and dispose of resources before and after the block's execution. This is relevant for starting/stopping timers, etc. Many functions can be registered and they will all be executed.- `on_enter(func: stacklog -&gt; None)`- `on_exit(func: stacklog -&gt; None)`See the implementation of `stacktime` for an example.### Adding timing informationOne can customize `stacklog` with callbacks to, for example, add information on the duration of block execution.```pycon&gt;&gt;&gt; with stacktime(print, 'Running some code', unit='ms'):...     time.sleep(1e-2)...Running some code...Running some code...DONE in 11.11 ms```# History## 1.0 (2019-12-10)Initial release.</longdescription>

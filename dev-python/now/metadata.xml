	<longdescription>now===This is a command-line tool for tracking what you're doing as simply aspossible. It's for people who just want to describe what's going on and move onwithout messing with a 'system'.Currently it's in a raw, early stage.If you keep a file named ~/.now.txt for any other purpose, don't use this.Example::    now eating lunch    now nappingThese commands append lines to ~/.now.txt, prefixed with timestamps.If you want to use a different file instead of ~/.now.txt,create a file called ~/.nowrc with content like the following(where ~/bar is the name of the file you want to have written)::    write_to=~/barGive an absolute path. A relative path will generate an error.Principles:* Switches should not be required in normal operation.* The default action is to write the given message with a timestamp.* We don't write to multiple different files. Just one file.* Messages are not parsed; they have no syntax, and no reserved words.* Messages have no imposed inter-relationships.* Always write with UTF-8 encoding.* Always write the same line-based format.* The line format should be both obvious to humans and easily machine-parseable  (e.g, with regex).* Times are always given in UTC, with largest unit first (e.g. year-month-day).* Times are never tracked below the duration of 1 second.* `now` doesn't get involved in analyzing or rendering the data it produces.If you are interested in a fancier tool (written in Ruby and writinga customizable TaskPaper format), take a look at`Doing &lt;http://brettterpstra.com/projects/doing/&gt;`_.</longdescription>

The main reasons to use Xeye are:* Create a dataset using only a laptop and its integrated camera (or alternatively an external USB camera);* Create a dataset already structured like the [mnist](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/mnist);* Create a dataset that can be used for building models with [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) or [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/).&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div id='installation'/&gt;## InstallationTo install the package, ```pip install xeye```&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div id='xeye-datasets-for-deep-learning'/&gt;## Xeye datasets for deep learning In the [xeye-notebooks](https://github.com/marcosalvalaggio/xeye-notebooks) repository, you can find examples of deep learning model implementations based on datasets produced by the Xeye package (made with [Tensorflow](https://github.com/marcosalvalaggio/xeye-notebooks/tree/main/tensorflow) or [Pytorch](https://github.com/marcosalvalaggio/xeye-notebooks/tree/main/pytorch) frameworks).* [Binary dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qvoFa4SRWirXj7kdWhhcqrQ8mTIHpkuJ?usp=sharing): containing two types of grayscale images (with labels: 0=keyboard, 1=mouse).* [MultiLabel dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qvoFa4SRWirXj7kdWhhcqrQ8mTIHpkuJ?usp=sharing): containing three types of rgb images (three types of security cameras with labels: 0=dome, 1=bullet, 2=cube)Additionally, the [xeye-notebooks](https://github.com/marcosalvalaggio/xeye-notebooks) repository contains examples of scripts that use the Xeye package to build datasets ([examples link](https://github.com/marcosalvalaggio/xeye-notebooks/tree/main/xeye-example)).&lt;div id='create-a-dataset-with-full-ui'/&gt;&lt;hr&gt;## Xeye functionalitiesThe Xeye package includes three major approaches (classes) for creating a dataset from scratch: Dataset, FastDataset, and ManualDataset.* **Dataset**: Uses the full UI terminal interface.* **FastDataset**: Uses the constructor with all the specifications of the dataset.* **ManualDataset**: Same as FastDataset, but every image is shot manually one at a time.  Additionally, the package provides a method for combining datasets created with the **BuildDataset** class.&lt;hr&gt;## Create a dataset with full terminal UI (Dataset)First of all, load the module datapipe from the package:```pythonimport xeye```then initialize the instance like this ```pythondata = xeye.Dataset()```set the parameters related to the images with the **setup** method```pythondata.setup()```the execution of this method causes the starting of the user interface in the **terminal** ```console--- CAMERA SETTING ---Select the index of the camera that you want to use for creating the dataset: 1``` the **setup** method arises multiple questions that set the parameters' values```console--- IMAGE SETTINGS ---Num. of types of images to scan: 2Name of image type (1): keyboardName of image type (2): mouseNum. of frames to shoot for every image type: 10Single frame HEIGHT: 720Single frame WIDTH:  720num. of waiting time (in sec.) between every frame: 0``` Precisely the questions refer to:* **Select the index of the camera that you want to use for creating the dataset**: Generally 0 for integrated camera, 1 for USB external camera.* **Num. of types of images to scan**: Answer 2 if you want to create a dataset with two objects (e.g. keyboard and mouse). In general, answer with the number of object types to include in your dataset.* **Name of image type**: Insert the name of every specific object you want to include in the dataset. The **setup** method creates a named folder for every image type. * **Num. of frames to shoot for every image type**: Select the number of images you want to shoot and save them in every object folder. * **Single frame HEIGHT**: Frame height values.* **Single frame WIDTH**: Frame width values.* **Num. of waiting time (in sec.) between every frame**: e.g 0.2 causes a waiting time of 0.2 seconds between every shoot.After the parameters setting, you can invoke the method to start shooting images. Datapipe module provides two different formats of images:* Grayscale image with the **gray** method;* Color image with the **rgb** method.  Let's produce a dataset based on RGB images with the **rgb** method:```pythondata.rgb()```In the terminal keypress [b], to make photos for the image types passed to the **setup** method.```console--- START TAKING PHOTOS ---Press [b] on the keyboard to start data collection of image type [keyboard]bPress [b] on the keyboard to start data collection of image type [mouse]b``` On the directory of the script, you can find the folders that contain the images produced by the **rbg** method (e.g. keyboard folder and mouse folder). Images collected in the folders can be used for building datasets like the [mnist](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/mnist). The first approach to achieve this result is calling the **compress_train_test** method:```pythondata.compress_train_test()```That produces the following output in the terminal window ```console--- DATASET SETTING ---percentage of images in the test set: 0.2``` In which you can select the portion of images to use in the train and test datasets (write a value between (0,1)). By doing so, the method produces a **.npz** file formed by these specific tensors:* Train set:  * **X_train**: Matrices/tensors of every single image in the train dataset;  * **y_train**: Classes (ordinal values) are associated with every image in the train dataset.* Test set:  * **X_test**: Matrices/tensors of every single image in the test dataset;  * **y_test**: Classes (ordinal values) are associated with every image in the test dataset.  (matrices for grayscale images: [Height $\times$ Width $\times$ 1], tensors for RGB images:[Height $\times$ Width $\times$ 3]).An alternative approach is represented by the use of the **compress_all** method```pythondata.compress_all()```In this case, the images are united in a unique tensor that contains all the frames produced previously. * Unique tensor:  * **X**: Matricies/tensors of every single image produced;  * **y**: Classes (ordinal values) are associated with every image produced.Finally, you can use the **just_compress** method to create a unique tensor with all the images produced.```pythondata.just_compress()```In the terminal, you have to insert the dataset’s name```console--- DATASET SETTING ---Select a name for the compressed file: batch_test``` If you pass 0, by default the dataset will be save with the name **dataset_raw.npz**. The dataset produced by this method can be used by the class **BuildDataset** to put together more .npz files and create a dataset like the [mnist](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/mnist).&lt;div id='other-useful-methods'/&gt;### Other useful methods* **preview**: Open the camera stream to check the framing. * **var_control**: Print the values of the parameters set with the **setup** method.   ```console--- PARAMETERS CONTROL ---camera index: 1num. of images types: 2labels of images types: ['keyboard', 'mouse']num. of images for types: 20Single frame HEIGHT: 720Single frame WIDTH:  720waiting time between frames: 0.0percentage of images in train dataset: 0.2``` &lt;div id='script-example-1'/&gt;### Script example Example of a script to use the **Dataset** class:```pythonimport xeyedata = xeye.dataset()data.setup()data.preview()data.rgb()data.compress_train_test()data.compress_all()data.just_compress()```&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div id='create-a-dataset-with-fast-ui'/&gt;## Create a dataset with fast UI (FastDataset)The **FastDataset** class provides a faster way to use the datapipe module. Unlike the **Dataset** class, it does not have a complete terminal UI to guide you through the dataset construction process. Instead, you simply pass the parameters to the class and call the necessary methods.```pythonimport xeye# define parameters valuesindex = 0img_types = 2label = ['keyboard', 'mouse']num = 20height = 100width = 100standby_time = 0# percentage of images in the test set perc = 0.2data = xeye.FastDataset(index = index, img_types = img_types, label = label, num = num, height = height, width = width, stand_by_time = standby_time)data.preview()data.rgb()data.compress_train_test(perc = perc)data.compress_all()data.just_compress(&quot;batch_test&quot;)```The parameters passed to the class **FastDataset**:* **index**: Generally 0 for integrated camera, 1 for USB external camera.* **img_types**: Numbers of object types that you want to include in your dataset.* **label**: List of object names to include in the dataset. The **setup** method creates a named folder for every image type.* **num**: Select the number of images you want to shoot and save them in every object folder.* **height**: Frame height values.* **width**: Frame width values.* **standby_time**: e.g 0.2 cause a waiting time of 0.2 seconds between every shoot.  For split images in the train and test dataset, pass a value between (0,1) to the perc parameter of the **compress_train_test** method* **perc**: the portion of images to use in the test dataset, write a value between (0,1).If you don't pass any value to the **just_compress** method, the dataset will be saved with the name **dataset_raw.npz**.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div id='create-a-dataset-with-manual-ui'/&gt;## Create a dataset with manual UI (ManualDataset)The **ManualDataset** class is how you can build a dataset by taking pictures manually. ```pythonimport xeye# define parameters valuesindex = 0img_types = 2label = ['keyboard', 'mouse']num = 20height = 100width = 100standby_time = 0# percentage of images in the test set perc = 0.2data = xeye.ManualDataset(index = index, img_types = img_types, label = label, num = num, height = height, width = width)data.preview()data.rgb()data.compress_train_test(perc = perc)data.compress_all()data.just_compress(&quot;batch_test&quot;)```As you can see in the code snippet, the **ManualDataset** class works like the **FastDataset** class. The only difference is the absence of the **standby_time option**, which is no more necessary in this case. The parameters passed to the class **ManualDataset**:* **index**: Generally 0 for integrated camera, 1 for USB external camera.* **img_types**: Numbers of object types that you want to include in your dataset.* **label**: List of object names to include in the dataset. The constructor creates a named folder for every image type.* **num**: Select the number of images you want to shoot and save them in every object folder.* **height**: Frame height values.* **width**: Frame width values.### How to take pictures manuallyIn the title bar of the image window, after the caption identifying the image type, there are instructions for manually taking pictures using the ManualDataset. These instructions will be displayed as follows:* Camera view for image type &lt;name-of-image-type&gt;. Press [s] on the keyboard to save image number: &lt;nr-of-image&gt;. &lt;hr&gt;## Build datasets from different npz files (BuildDataset)If you want to create a dataset that includes different types of images, but cannot shoot all image types at once (e.g., due to time constraints or location differences), you can use the **BuildDataset** class.* Create datasets with the **just_compress** method;* Create different .npz files for every type of images that composes the dataset (use the same colour spaces in all datasets, RGB or grayscale);* Create a new script and call the **BuildDataset** class that merges all the .npz files created before.&lt;div id='script-example-2'/&gt;### Script example ```pythonimport xeye# list of directory (paths for the .npz files)path = ['batch_2.npz', 'batch_3.npz']# list of labels associated with the images inside the .npz fileslabel = [0,1]data = xeye.BuildDataset(path=path, label=label, size = None, color=True, split=True, perc=0.2)data.build()```The parameters passed to the class **BuildDataset**:* **path**: List of files (.npz) path you want to include in the new dataset* **label**: List of ordinal integer values representing the class type of the images inside a .npz file contained in the new dataset. In the example script, the first .npz file images are associated with class 0, while the second .npz file images are associated with class 1. Remember: always start with 0.* **size**: Tuple (height, width) for the images in the new dataset created. The default value (None) indicates that new images have the maximum height and width found in the datasets listed as dimensions* **color**: Defines if the images contained in the .npz files are RGB or grayscale. A boolean value, by default, is set to True (meaning RGB images).* **split**: Defines if you want to build a dataset split in train-test or not. A boolean value, by default, is set to True.* **perc**: Defines the percentage of images assigned to the test dataset. A floating value between (0,1). It's set to 0.1 by default.When you want to use the **BuildDataset** class, you need to have .npz files containing images with the same types of colour spaces (all grayscale images or RGB).</longdescription>

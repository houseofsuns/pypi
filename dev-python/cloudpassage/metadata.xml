If you want to makemodifications to the SDK you can install it in editable mode by downloadingthe source from this github repo, navigating to the top directory within thearchive and running ``pip install -e .`` (note the . at the end).Quick Start-----------Here's the premise: you store your session configuration information (APIcredentials, proxy settings, etc) in the cloudpassage.HaloSession object.This object gets passed into the various class methods which allow youto interact with the CloudPassage Halo API.Practical example:We'll print a list of all servers in our account:::    import cloudpassage    api_key = MY_HALO_API_KEY    api_secret = MY_API_SECRET    session = cloudpassage.HaloSession(api_key, api_secret)    server = cloudpassage.Server(session)    list_of_servers = server.list_all()    for s in list_of_servers:        print(&quot;ID: {}   Name: {}&quot;.format(s[&quot;id&quot;], s[&quot;hostname&quot;]))Docs====Where to download-----------------Documentation can be found athttp://cloudpassage-halo-python-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latestTesting=======Testing procedure is documented at: http://cloudpassage-halo-python-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/testing.htmlChangelog=========v1.6.4 (2022-06-22)-------------------Fix~~~- Fixed policy list failures. [Thomas Miller]v1.6.3 (2022-05-23)-------------------Changes~~~~~~~- Upgrade all deprecated CloudPassage HALO Endpoints. [Thomas Miller]v1.6.1------Changes~~~~~~~- Add max_pages optional param to Issue list_all method. [Paul Chang]- Add support for Container Secure endpoints. [Paul Chang]v1.5.0 (2019-07-27)-------------------Changes~~~~~~~- Styling for tests. [Paul Chang]- More styles. [Paul Chang]- Styling. [Paul Chang]- Add docs for CSP. [Paul Chang]- Add support for Cloud Secure endpoints. [Paul Chang]Fix~~~- Fixed validation failures on v3 issues ID format. [Ash Wilson]  Closes #194v1.4.0 (2019-06-11)-------------------New~~~- API version selectors for abstractions. [Ash Wilson]  Closes #181- Create stream() generator method in Event class. [Ash Wilson]  Closes #179Changes~~~~~~~- Using safer yaml.SafeLoader in ApiKeyManager. [Ash Wilson]- Update version pin for pytest. [Ash Wilson]- Add docs for CveDetails. [Ash Wilson]v1.3.0 (2019-03-01)-------------------New~~~- Added list_packages() to Server() object. [Ash Wilson]  Closes #165v1.2.2 (2018-10-31)-------------------New~~~- Python 3.6.5 support. [Ash Wilson]v1.2 (2018-10-28)-----------------New~~~- Python 3.7 support. [Ash Wilson]Changes~~~~~~~- Improved deduplication in TimeSeries class. [Ash Wilson]  Expanded deduplication routine to compare against prior  batch of objects from API. In some extremely rare circumstances,  multiple different events with the exact same timestamp would slip  through the deduplication routine `TimeSeries.remove_duplicate_items`.  This patch improves deduplication while still using the object's  timestamp as a cursor.  Closes #142- Improve documentation of Server() instance methods. [Ash Wilson]v1.1.5 (2018-09-15)-------------------New~~~- Use connection pooling. [Ash Wilson]  The SDK now uses connection pooling via the requests.Session() object. This  brings performance benefits as the SDK will no longer need to open a new TLS  connection for every interaction with the CloudPassage API.  Connection pool minimum of 1, max of 10 concurrent connections in session.  Closes #112  Exponential backoff implemented via requests, 5 tries max.  Retry happens in requests via HTTPAdapter for everything but re-auth, which is caught and retried in SDK.  Closes #113  Migrated CI testing environment.  Closes #114Changes~~~~~~~- Codeclimate coverage for master branch. [Ash Wilson]  Closes #121- Testing matrix includes Python2.7.10 and 2.7.15. [Ash Wilson]  We can add more over time, as the need arises. Adding  another version of Python adds around 12 minutes to total  CI time per commit, and tests cannot be run in parallel.  Closes #115- Updated requests version pin to &gt;=2.18. [Ash Wilson]  Removed requirements.txt file, which was unnecessary. The  setup.py file is used by easy_install to ensure dependencies  are in place.  Closes #118Other~~~~~- Use uuid to generate random alert profile and server group name.

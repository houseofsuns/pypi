	<longdescription>Introduction============This package will allow you to get zip code information. The data used in thispackage can be retrieved fromhttps://web.archive.org/web/20101126192032/http://pablotron.org/files/zipcodes-csv-10-Aug-2004.zip`pyzipcode` uses a local sqlite database to run. You can replace it with yourown other storage mechanism with a little effort.Here is some basic usage...```pycon&gt;&gt;&gt; from pyzipcode import ZipCodeDatabase&gt;&gt;&gt; zcdb = ZipCodeDatabase()&gt;&gt;&gt; zcdb[54115]ZipCode(zip='54115', city='De Pere', state='WI', longitude=-88.07896, latitude=44.42042, timezone=-6, dst=1)&gt;&gt;&gt; zcdb[210]ZipCode(zip='00210', city='Portsmouth', state='NH', longitude=-71.013202, latitude=43.005895, timezone=-5, dst=1)```Search zip codes...```pycon&gt;&gt;&gt; from pyzipcode import ZipCodeDatabase&gt;&gt;&gt; zcdb = ZipCodeDatabase()&gt;&gt;&gt; len(zcdb.find_zip(city=&quot;Oshkosh&quot;))7&gt;&gt;&gt; len(zcdb.find_zip(city=&quot;O%&quot;))  # all cities starting with &quot;O&quot; using SQL wildcard60&gt;&gt;&gt; len(zcdb.find_zip(city=&quot;Doesn't Exist&quot;))  # returns None&gt;&gt;&gt; ```Get a list of zipcodes around a radius of a zipcode (this actually searches a square area)```pycon&gt;&gt;&gt; from pyzipcode import ZipCodeDatabase&gt;&gt;&gt; zcdb = ZipCodeDatabase()&gt;&gt;&gt; [z.zip for z in zcdb.get_zipcodes_around_radius('54901', 10)]['54901', '54902', '54903', '54904', '54906', '54927', '54952', '54956', '54957', '54979', '54985']```The Data========The following is the original README file from `zipcodes-csv-10-Aug-2004.zip`:```textCivicSpace US ZIP Code Database-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-written by Schuyler Erle &lt;schuyler@geocoder.us&gt;5 August 2004corrected total count and removed sql table definitionNeil Drumm &lt;neil@civicspacelabs.org&gt;10 August 2004The ZIP code database contained in 'zipcode.csv' contains 43191 ZIPcodes for the continetal United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico,and American Samoa. The database is in comma separated value format,with columns for ZIP code, city, state, latitude, longitude, timezone(offset from GMT), and daylight savings time flag (1 if DST is observedin this ZIP code and 0 if not).This database was composed using ZIP code gazetteers from the US CensusBureau from 1999 and 2000, augmented with additional ZIP code informationfrom the Census Bureau's TIGER/Line 2003 data set. Timezone informationwas added using cartographic data sets from nationalatlas.gov. Thedatabase is guaranteed to exclusively contain information gathered fromsources in the public domain, and thus be legal to redistribute.The database is believed to contain over 98% of the ZIP Codes in currentuse in the United States. The remaining ZIP Codes absent from thisdatabase are entirely PO Box or Firm ZIP codes added in the last fiveyears, which are no longer published by the Census Bureau, but in anyevent serve a very small minority of the population (probably on theorder of .1% or less). Although every attempt has been made to filterthem out, this data set may contain up to .5% false positives, that is,ZIP codes that do not exist or are no longer in use but are included dueto erroneous data sources. The latitude and longitude given for each ZIPcode is typically (though not always) the geographic centroid of the ZIPcode; in any event, the location given can generally be expected to liesomewhere within the ZIP code's &quot;boundaries&quot;.The database andthis README are copyright 2004 CivicSpace Labs, Inc.,and are published under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlikelicense, which requires that all updates must be released under the samelicense.

	<longdescription># BuildingSync Asset Extractor (BAE)This package processes a BuildingSync file to extract asset information that can then be imported into SEED## Installation### Install from PyPI```bashpip install buildingsync-asset-extractor```### Install from source[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is required to install buildingsync-asset-extractor.```bash# Copy repogit clone https://github.com/BuildingSync/BuildingSync-asset-extractor.git# install the packagecd BuildingSync-asset-extractorpoetry install# Test that it works, you should see a message describing the usagepoetry run buildingsync_asset_extractor```## UsageBuildingSync version 2.4.0.The pre-importer will identify assets defined in the `asset_definitions.json` file stored in the `config` directory.  There are various methods of calculating assets:1. `sqft`.  The sqft method will calculate a 'primary' and 'secondary' value for the asset based on the area it serves. This is calculated from the floor areas defined in each `Section` element.  `Conditioned` floor area values will be used if present; `Gross` otherwise.1. `num`. The num method will sum up all assets of the specified type and return a single overall number.1. `avg`. The avg method will return an average value for all assets of the specified type found.1. `avg_sqft`. The avg_sqft method will return a weighted average value for all assets of the specified type found based on the area they serve.1. `age_oldest`, `age_newest`, `age_average`. The age method will retrieve the 'YearOfManufacture' (or 'YearInstalled' if not present) element of a specified equipment type and return either the oldest or newest, or average age (year) as specified. Average age is calculated by a weighted average using the following (in order): capacity, served space area, regular average.1. `custom`. Use this method for particular asset that do not fit in the other categories; i.e. Heating Efficiency. Note that a dedicated method may need to be written to support this type of asset.When an asset has a unit associated with it, a separate asset will be generated to store the unit information. That asset will be named the same as the original asset, with ' Units' appended at the end.To test usage:```bashpython buildingsync_asset_extractor/main.py```This will extract assets from `tests/files/testfile.xml` and save the results to `assets_output.json`There are 2 methods of initializing the Processor: with either a filename or data```bashbp = BSyncProcessor(filename=filename)```or```bashbp = BSyncProcessor(data=file_data)```## Assumptions1. Assuming 1 building per file1. Assuming sqft method uses &quot;Conditioned&quot; floor area for calculations. If not present, uses &quot;Gross&quot;1. Assuming averages that use served space area must be defined in Sections (LinkedSectionIDs). LinkedBuildingID is not used.## TODO1. thermal zones: when spaces are listed within them with spaces (or multiple thermal zones), this would change the average setpoint calculations. Is this an exception or a normal case to handle?## Assets Definitions FileThis file is used to specify what assets to extract from a BuildingSync XML file. By default, the file found in `config/asset_definitions.json` is used, but a custom file can be specified with the `set_asset_defs_file` method in the `BSyncProcessor` class.There are currently 5 types of assets that can be extracted:1. sqft: Sqft assets take into account the floor area served by a specific asset and returns 'Primary' and 'Secondary' values.  For example: Primary HVAC System and Secondary HVAC System.1. avg_sqft: Avg_sqft assets compute a weighted average to get the an average asset value.  For example:  Average Heating Setpoint.1. num: Num assets count the total number of the specified asset found.  For example, Total number of lighting systems.1. age_oldest, age_newest, and age_average: These types return the oldest or newest asset, or average age of a specific type.  For example: Oldest Boiler.1. custom: For asset that need particular handling, such as Heating Efficiency. The current assets that have custom methods are:- Heating System Efficiency- Cooling System Efficiency- Lighting System Efficiency- Water Heater Efficiency- Heating Fuel TypeThe schema for the assets definition JSON file is in `schemas/asset_definitions_schema.json`.## Extracted Assets FileThe schema for the extracted assets JSON file is in `schemas/extracted_assets_schema.json`.This file lists the extracted assets information in name, value, units triples.  Names will match the `export_name` listed in the asset_definitions JSON file, except for assets of type 'sqft', which will be prepended by 'Primary' and 'Secondary'.## Developing### Pre-commitThis project uses `pre-commit &lt;https://pre-commit.com/&gt;`_ to ensure code consistency.To enable pre-commit on every commit run the following from the command line from within the git checkout of the BuildingSync-asset-extractor```bash  pre-commit install```To run pre-commit against the files without calling git commit, then run the following. This is useful when cleaning up the repo before committing.```bash  pre-commit run --all-files```### Testingpoetry run pytest## Releasing```bashpoetry build# config and push to testpypipoetry config repositories.testpypi https://test.pypi.org/legacy/poetry publish -r testpypi# install from testpypipip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ buildingsync-asset-extractor```If everything looks good, publish to pypi:```bashpoetry publish```If you have environment variables setup for PYPI token username and password:```bashpoetry publish --build --username $PYPI_USERNAME --password $PYPI_PASSWORD```</longdescription>

How many lines are in this particular play?2. How many lines does a given character speak in this play?3. Which characters speak, in which scenes and acts?As a result of the implementation, this tool can be applied to any body of text which adhere's to its parsing syntax.## The SchemaThe full schema specification has been written in JSONSchema 7.0 and can be found[here](schema.json)## DocumentationThe full documentation is available at[iambic.seandstewart.io](https://iambic.seandstewart.io)## How to Contribute1.

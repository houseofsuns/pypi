	<longdescription>Rastless-CLI=================##### A cli for managing data and user access for the cloud application rastless## Table of Content- [Installation](#installation)- [Running the CLI](#running-the-cli)- [Commands Overview](#commands-overview)- [Accomplishing a running system](#accomplishing-a-running-system)- [Publish and Release](#publish-and-release)## InstallationRequires: Python &gt;=3.8, &lt;4.0```bash$ pip install rastless-cli```RastLess has to be configured before you can check if everything works. Make sure that your aws account is configuredand has access to DynamoDb and S3.You can check if everything works correctly by running:```bash$ rastless check-aws-connection```If it is not working, make sure to configure the aws connection by configuring the aws cli. You need an Access ID and aSecret ID from aws to configure. Please checkthe [official instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html) for furtherhelp.##### Developer Installation```bash$ pip install poetry$ git clone https://github.com/EomapCompany/rastless-cli$ cd rastless-cli$ poetry install```Run tests```bashcd testspoetry run pytest```## Running the CLIAfter installation you can run the ClI by using:```bash$ rastless --help```You can decide if you want to upload data to the production or development environment.By using the &quot;dev&quot; flag you upload it to development, without to production```bash# Example development$ rastless --dev list-layers# Example production$ rastless list-layers```## Commands Overview| Commands             |                                                     ||----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|| add-colormap         | Add a SLD file                                      || add-permission       | Add a role to one or multiple layers                || check-aws-connection | Check if cli can connect to aws                     || create-layer         | Create layer                                        || create-timestep      | Create timestep entry and upload layer to S3 bucket || delete-colormap      | Remove a SLD file                                   || delete-layer         | Delete a layer with all timestep entries            || delete-permission    | Delete one or multiple permissions                  || list-layers          | List all layers                                     |## Accomplishing a running system#### 1. Check if you have access to the system```bash$ rastless check-aws-connection```#### 2. Create a new layer- All inputs are strings. You have to take care, that the element exists in the database e.g. the colormap name.- Multiple permissions can be set by using multiple -pe flags```bash$ rastless create-layer -cl hypos -pr tur -t Turbidity -cm log75_C2S8_32bit -u FTU -b &lt;rgb uuid&gt; -d &quot;Some description&quot; -r 1 -pe user#marcel -pe role#hypos:full-access```It will return a new uuid which you need to store, in order to upload timesteps to the particular layer#### 3. Upload Timesteps for layer```bash$ rastless create-timestep -d 2020-01-01T15:00:00 -s SENT2 -l &lt;layer uuid&gt; -t daily -p deflate```## Breaking changes### Version 0.3The command &quot;create-timestep&quot; changed. Files need to be set as flag instead of normal input- Now it is possible to set multiple files per timestep by setting multiple file flags -f- To override a timestep which already exists you have to set the flag -o, otherwise you will be asked during uploading  if you really want to override it- To append new files to an existing timestep you have to set the flag -a- **Attention:** If you append a file to an existing timestep and the filename already exists, it will be automatically  overridden  without further action```shell# Before. Filepath without flagrastless create-timestep file1.tif -d 2020-01-01T15:00:00 -s Sent2 -layer-id 1234 -t daily -p deflate# Now: Single file.

If #none is contained in the merge commit message, it will skip the version bump.When none of the above types is provided the default version bump (minor) is triggered. After the tagging a packagebuilt and release to Pypi is triggered. If all steps were successfully a new GitHub release is created.</longdescription>

	<longdescription>=============awscli-cwlogs=============This awscli plugin provides the ``pull``, ``push`` and ``filter`` commands to access AWS CloudWatch Logs service.The awscli-cwlogs package works on Python versions:* 2.6.5 and greater* 2.7.x and greater* 3.3.x and greater------------Installation------------The easiest way to install awscli-cwlogs is to use `pip`_::    $ pip install awscli-cwlogsor, if you are not installing in a ``virtualenv``::    $ sudo pip install awscli-cwlogsIf you have the awscli-cwlogs installed and want to upgrade to the latest versionyou can run::    $ pip install --upgrade awscli-cwlogsThis will install the awscli-cwlogs package as well as all dependencies, including awscli... attention::    If you have awscli installed, installing awscli-cwlogs might upgrade or downgrade your awscli depending on whether the awscli version you have is older or newer than what the awscli-cwlogs depends on. After installing awscli-cwlogs, you can run ``pip install --upgrade awscli`` to upgrade your awscli though potentially the latest awscli might not work well with the plugin. If you want to isolate awscli-cwlogs plugin from your existing awscli, you may consider ``virtaulenv``. Be careful that awscli by default stores its configuration to ~/.aws/config (or in %UserProfile%\.aws\config on Windows), to also isolate the configuration, you can define a separate config file ``export AWS_CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/config_file``.---------------Getting Started---------------Before using awscli-cwlogs plugin, you need to `configure awscli &lt;http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html&gt;`__ first.Once that's done, to enable awscli-cwlogs, you can run::    $ aws configure set plugins.cwlogs cwlogsThe above command adds below section to your aws config file::    [plugins]    cwlogs = cwlogsTo verify if awscli-cwlogs plugin is installed and configured properly, you can run::    $ aws logs helpYou will see the ``pull``, ``push`` and ``fitler`` commands from available commands, otherwise it means the cwlogs plugin is not registered properly.If you see ``ImportError: No module named cwlogs`` error, it means the cwlogs plugin is registered in config file, but the plugin is not installed.^^^^^^^^Examples^^^^^^^^............. Push command.............You can use ``aws logs push help`` to check supported options.The ``push`` command is used by CloudWatch Logs agent, check the `CloudWatch Logs Agent Reference &lt;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/AgentReference.html&gt;`__ to see all supported options or if you want to keep the ``push`` command running.1) Uploading a single log event to CloudWatch Logs service. The log group and log stream get created automatically if they don't exist.::    echo &quot;Hello World&quot; | aws logs push --log-group-name MyLogGroup --log-stream-name MyLogStream2) The following ``push`` command pushes log events from a syslog file to log stream which is specified by ``/var/log/syslog`` and ``myhost1`` and exits after pushing all log events. This command doesn't push the incremental log events. To achieve that, use ``tail -f file | aws logs push ...``.::    cat /var/log/kernel.log | aws logs push --log-group-name /var/log/syslog --log-stream-name myhost1 --datetime-format '%b %d %H:%M:%S' --time-zone LOCAL --encoding ascii3) The following ``push`` command pushes log events from multiple files based on configuration file. The ``initial_position`` determines where to start if the state of  ``file`` is not available.::    aws logs push --config-file push.cfg::    [general]    state_file = push-state    [logstream-messages]    datetime_format = %b %d %H:%M:%S    time_zone = LOCAL    file = /var/log/messages    file_fingerprint_lines = 1    log_group_name = /var/log/messages    log_stream_name = {hostname}    initial_position = start_of_file    encoding = utf_8    buffer_duration = 5000    [logstream-system.log]    datetime_format = %b %d %H:%M:%S    time_zone = UTC    file = /var/log/system.log    file_fingerprint_lines = 1-3    log_group_name = /var/log/system.log    log_stream_name = {hostname}    initial_position = end_of_file    encoding = ascii    buffer_duration = 10000............. Pull command.............You can use ``aws logs pull help`` to check supported options.1) The following ``pull`` command pulls log events starting at ``2014-01-23T00:00:00Z`` from one log stream which is specified by ``website1/access_log`` and ``webhost-001`` and exits after pulling all log events.::    aws logs pull --log-group-name website1/access_log --log-stream-name webhost-001 --start-time 2014-01-23T00:00:00Z2) When invoked with the ``--end-time`` option, the following ``pull`` command pulls all log events between ``2014-01-23T00:00:00Z`` (inclusive) and ``2014-01-23T01:00:00Z`` (not inclusive).::    aws logs pull --log-group-name website1/access_log --log-stream-name webhost-001 --start-time 2014-01-23T00:00:00Z --end-time 2014-01-23T01:00:00Z3) When invoked with the ``--follow`` option, the following ``pull`` command does not exit after pulling all log events, but polls continuously for new log events.::    aws logs pull --log-group-name website1/access_log --log-stream-name webhost-001 --start-time 2014-01-23T00:00:00Z --follow4) When invoked with the ``--output-format`` option, the following ``pull`` command only outputs the message field. By default, the output format is ``&quot;{timestamp} {message}&quot;``. Ingestion time can be included with ``&quot;{timestamp} {ingestionTime} {message}&quot;``.::    aws logs pull --log-group-name website1/access_log --log-stream-name webhost-001 --start-time 2014-01-23T00:00:00Z --output-format &quot;{message}&quot;...............

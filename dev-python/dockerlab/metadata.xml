Say bye bye to the [&quot;It works on my machine&quot;](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/70we66/it_works_on_my_machine/) problem.- **Convenient**: We made some convenient setups for you, including tools and functions:  - tools: [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), [docker within docker](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-can-now-run-within-docker/), [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki), [lightvim](https://github.com/hughplay/lightvim)  - free of permission problems: same uid and gid as the host  - reversely mounting $HOME directory from container to host    - easy to share `~/.ssh` and `~/.gitconfig`    - files will not be lost even if the container is removed, e.g., zsh history, configuration files, model checkpoints, ...  - free of port mapping: sharing network with the host- **Pre-built Images**: We provide several basic [pre-built images](dockerlab/templates/) for quickly setting up your own workspace environment.## Quick Start**1. Install dockerlab**Install dockerlab with pip:```bashpip install dockerlab```Or install the latest version from source:```bashpip install git+https://github.com/hughplay/dockerlab.git```**2. Setup a dockerlab project**Create a new dockerlab project:```bashdockerlab new &lt;project_name&gt;```Or init a dockerlab environment for the existing project:```bashdockerlab init .```This will setup a few files and directories, the structure is as follows:```bash.├── docker/│   ├── Dockerfile│   └── misc/├── docker-compose.yml├── docker.py└── .gitignore```**3. DIY your own workspace environment**In general, you only need to modify `docker/Dockerfile` to customize your own workspace environment. Files you may care about:- `docker/Dockerfile`: The dockerfile for building the docker image.- `docker-compose.yml`: The docker-compose file for building the docker container.- `docker.py`: The python script for building and starting the container.We have prepared several templates and pre-built docker images for you. You can replace the default `docker/Dockerfile` with the template you like by running the following command:```bashdockerlab use &lt;template_name&gt;```The available templates can be listed by `dockerlab ls`, and the details of each template can be found in [dockerlab/templates](dockerlab/templates).By default, the generated `docker/Dockerfile` will use pre-built docker images if there exists. You can also get the full dockerfile by running the following command:```bashdockerlab use &lt;template_name&gt; --full```**4. Build and start the container**```bashpython docker.py startd```When you first execute the above command, it will ask you to enter information related to the container and store them in `.env`. The example of prompt and the output are as follows:```bash# promptsGive a project name [dockerlab]: dockerlabCode root to be mounted at /project [.]:Data root to be mounted at /data [data]:`/home/hongxin/code/dockerlab/data` does not exist in your machine. Create? [yes]:Log root to be mounted at /log [log]:`/home/hongxin/code/dockerlab/log` does not exist in your machine. Create? [yes]:directory to be mounted to hongxin [./docker/misc/container_home]:`/home/hongxin/code/dockerlab/container_home` does not exist in your machine. Create? [yes]:# outputYour setting (.env):  UID: 1000  GID: 1000  USER_NAME: hongxin  PROJECT: dockerlab  CODE_ROOT: .

Get in the container and start your journey.**```bashpython docker.py```## LicenseDockerLab is released under the [MIT license](LICENSE).</longdescription>

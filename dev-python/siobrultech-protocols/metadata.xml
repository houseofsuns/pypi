	<longdescription>![Lint](https://github.com/sdwilsh/siobrultech-protocols/workflows/Lint/badge.svg)![Build](https://github.com/sdwilsh/siobrultech-protocols/workflows/Build/badge.svg)# What is siobrultech-protocols?This library is a collection of protcols that decode various packet formats from[Brultech Research](https://www.brultech.com/).# What is Sans-I/O?Sans-I/O is a philosophy for developing protocol processing libraries in whichthe library does not do any I/O. Instead, a user of the library is responsiblefor transferring blocks of bytes between the socket or pipe and the protocollibrary, and for receiving application-level protocol items from and sendingthem to the library. This obviously makes a sans-I/O library a little moredifficult to use, but comes with the advantage that the same library can beused with any I/O and concurrency mechanism: the same library should be usablein a single-request-at-a-time server, a process-per-request orthread-per-request blocking server, a server using select/poll andcontinuations, or a server using asyncio, Twisted, or any other asynchronousframework.See [SansIO](https://sans-io.readthedocs.io/) for more information.## Installation```pip install siobrultech-protocols```## Usage### Receiving data packets```pythonimport functoolsfrom siobrultech_protocols.gem.protocol import PacketProtocol, PacketReceivedMessage# Queue to get received packets from.queue = asyncio.Queue()# Pass this Protocol to whatever receives data from the device.protocol_factory = functools.partial(PacketProtocol, queue=queue)# Dequeue and look for packet received messages. (Typically do this in a loop.)message = await queue.get()if isinstance(message, PacketReceivedMessage):    packet = message.packetqueue.task_done()```### Receiving data packets AND sending API commandsIf you want to send API commands as well, use a `BidirectionalProtocol` instead of a `PacketProtocol`, and keep track of the protocol instance for each active connection. Then given the `protocol` instance for a given connection, do the API call as follows:```pythonfrom siobrultech_protocols.gem.api import get_serial_numberserial = await get_serial_number(protocol)```#### Methods to Get Information from a Device| Method              | Description                              || ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- || `get_serial_number` | Obtains the serial number of the device. |#### Methods to Setup a Device| Method                        | Description                                                                 || ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- || `set_date_and_time`           | Sets the GEM's clock to the specified `datetime`.                           || `set_packet_format`           | Sets the GEM's packet format to the specified `PacketFormatType`.           || `set_packet_send_interval`    | Sets the frequency (seconds) that the GEM should send packets.              || `set_secondary_packet_format` | Sets the GEM's secondary packet format to the specified `PacketFormatType`. || `synchronize_time`            | Synchronizes the GEM's clock to the time of the local device.               |### Calling API endpoints that aren't supported by this libraryThe API support in `siobrultech_protocols` is in its infancy. If you want to call an API endpoint for which this library doesn't provide a helper, you can make your own. For example, the following outline could be filled in to support the &quot;get all settings&quot; endpoint; you would use `GET_ALL_SETTINGS`:```pythonfrom siobrultech_protocols.gem import api# Define a Python data type for the response. It can be whatever you want; a simple Dict, a custom dataclass, etc.AllSettings = Dict[str, Any]def _parse_all_settings(response: str) -&gt; AllSettings:    # Here you would parse the response into the python type you defined aboveGET_ALL_SETTINGS = api.ApiCall[None, AllSettings](    formatter=lambda _: &quot;^^^RQSALL&quot;, parser=_parse_all_settings)# Start the API request; do this once for each API call. Each protocol instance can only support one# API call at a time.delay = protocol.begin_api_request()sleep(delay)  # Wait for the specified delay, using whatever mechanism is appropriate for your environment# Send the API request.delay = GET_ALL_SETTINGS.send_request(protocol, None)sleep(delay)# Parse the response after it has arrivedsettings = GET_ALL_SETTINGS.receive_response(protocol)# End the API requestprotocol.end_api_request()```Alternatively, we also provide a context wrapper that works with `asyncio` as well:```pythonfrom siobrultech_protocols.gem import api# Define a Python data type for the response. It can be whatever you want; a simple Dict, a custom dataclass, etc.AllSettings = Dict[str, Any]def _parse_all_settings(response: str) -&gt; AllSettings:    # Here you would parse the response into the python type you defined aboveGET_ALL_SETTINGS = api.ApiCall[None, AllSettings](    formatter=lambda _: &quot;^^^RQSALL&quot;, parser=_parse_all_settings)async with api.call_api(GET_ALL_SETTINGS, protocol) as f:    settings = await f(None)```Take a look at some usage examples from [libraries that use this](https://github.com/sdwilsh/siobrultech-protocols/network/dependents).### Calling API endpoints when multiple devices share a connectionAll of the API helper methods take an optional `serial_number` parameter to target a specific device if there are multiple devices on the same connection.## Development### Setup```python3.11 -m venv .venvsource .venv/bin/activate# Install Requirementspip install -r requirements.txt# Install Dev Requirementspip install -r requirements-dev.txt# One-Time Install of Commit Hookspre-commit install```### TestingTests are run with `pytest`.</longdescription>

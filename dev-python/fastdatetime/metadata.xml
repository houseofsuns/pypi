In Python, one would usually opt for using the `dateutil` package, which can deal with all sorts of edge cases and is very forgiving, however these guarantees come at a cost – in order for the results to not be ambiguous but accurate, the user can tweak a lot of options (is the day or year first, ...) and has to sacrifice performance. Enter [`dtparse` by Bradlee Speice](https://speice.io/2018/06/dateutil-parser-to-rust.html), a rewrite of `dateutil.parse` in Rust. Going full circle, `fastdatetime` just exposes Python bindings to Bradlee's excellent [crate](https://crates.io/crates/dtparse). This yields ~15x faster parsing performance (657 vs 42 Kops/sec on M1 Pro). ## InstallationTBD## FAQTBD## Acknowledgements* [time](https://github.com/time-rs/time) and [time-fmt](https://github.com/misawa/time-fmt) for the default `strptime` implementation* [chrono](https://github.com/chronotope/chrono) as an alternative implementation parse `strptime` formats ([specifiers reference](https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/index.html))* [dtparse](https://github.com/bspeice/dtparse) ([dateutil](https://github.com/dateutil/dateutil) implemented in Rust)* [pyo3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3) for Python bindings* [maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin) for building Python wheels## License&amp;copy; 2022 Contributors of Project fastdatetime.This project is licensed under either of- [Apache License, Version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) ([`LICENSE-APACHE`](LICENSE-APACHE))- [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) ([`LICENSE-MIT`](LICENSE-MIT))at your option.The [SPDX](https://spdx.dev) license identifier for this project is `MIT OR Apache-2.0`.</longdescription>

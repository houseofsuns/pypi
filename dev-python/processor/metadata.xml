See `full list of sources`_ in the docs.Output    A function which accepts a ``data object`` as input and could output another. See `full list of outputs`_ in the docs.    (or same) ``data object`` as result.Predicate    Pipeline consists from sources outputs, but ``predicate`` decides which    ``data object`` should be processed by which ``output``.Quick example=============Here is example of pipeline which reads IMAP folder and sends all emails to Slack chat:.. code:: python    run_pipeline(        sources.imap('imap.gmail.com'                     'username',                     'password'                     'INBOX'),        [prepare_email_for_slack, outputs.slack(SLACK_URL)])Here you construct a pipeline, which uses ``sources.imap`` for reading imap folder&quot;INBOX&quot; of ``username@gmail.com``. In more complex case ``outputs.fanout``can be used for routing dataobjects to different processors and ``sources.mix`` canbe used to merge items two or more sources into a one stream.Functions ``prepare_email_to_slack`` and ``outputs.slack(SLACK_URL)`` are processors. First oneis a simple function which accepts data object, returned by imap source and transformingit to the data object which could be used by slack.output. We need that because slackrequires a different set of fields. Call to ``outputs.slack(SLACK_URL)`` returns afunction which gets an object and send it to the specified Slack's endpoint.It is just example, for working snippets, continue reading this documention ;-).. Note:: By the way, did you know there is a Lisp dialect which runs on Python          virtual machine? It's name is HyLang, and python processor is written in this          language.    Installation============Create a virtual environment with python3:::     virtualenv --python=python3 env   source env/bin/activateInstall required version of hylang (this step is necessary because Hy syntax is notfinal yet and frequently changed by language maintainers):::  pip install -U 'git+git://github.com/hylang/hy.git@a3bd90390cb37b46ae33ce3a73ee84a0feacce7d#egg=hy'If you are on OSX, then install lxml on OSX separately:::      STATIC_DEPS=true pip install lxmlIf you want to access IMAP over SSL on OSX, then you need to install``openssl`` via homebrew, and then install ``pyopenssl`` like this:::  brew install openssl  env LDFLAGS=&quot;-L$(brew --prefix openssl)/lib&quot; \      CFLAGS=&quot;-I$(brew --prefix openssl)/include&quot; \      pip install -U --force-reinstall pyopensslThen install the ``processor``:::    pip install processorUsage=====Now create an executable python script, where you'll place your pipline's configuration.For example, this simple code creates a process line which searches new results in Twitterand outputs them to console. Of cause, you can output them not only to console, but alsopost by email, to Slack chat or everywhere else if there is an output for it:.. code:: python    #!env/bin/python3    import os    from processor import run_pipeline, sources, outputs    from twiggy_goodies.setup import setup_logging    for_any_message = lambda msg: True    def prepare(tweet):        return {'text': tweet['text'],                'from': tweet['user']['screen_name']}    setup_logging('twitter.log')    run_pipeline(        sources=[sources.twitter.search(            'My Company',            consumer_key='***', consumer_secret='***',            access_token='***', access_secret='***',            )],        rules=[(for_any_message, [prepare, outputs.debug()])])Running this code, will fetch new results for search by query ``My Company``and output them on the screen. Of course, you could use any other ``output``,supported by the ``processor``. Browse online documentation to find outwhich sources and outputs are supported and for to configure them... _full list of sources: sources.html.. _full list of outputs: outputs.htmlIdeas for Sources and Outputs=============================* ``web-hook`` endpoint `(in progress)`.* ``tail`` source which reads file and outputs lines appeared in a file between invocations  or is able to emulate ``tail -f`` behaviour. Python module  `tailer &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tailer/&gt;`_ could be used here.* ``grep`` output -- a filter to grep some fields using patterns. With ``tail`` and ``grep``  you could build a pipeline which watch on a log and send errors by email or to the chat.* ``xmpp`` output.* ``irc`` output.* ``rss/atom feed reader``.* ``weather`` source which tracks tomorrow's weather forecast and outputs a message if it was  changed significantly, for example from &quot;sunny&quot; to &quot;rainy&quot;.* ``github`` some integrations with github API?* ``jira`` or other task tracker of your choice?* `suggest your ideas!`Documentation=============https://python-processor.readthedocs.org/Development===========To run the all tests run::    toxAuthors=======* Alexander Artemenko - http://dev.svetlyak.ruChangelog=========0.10.0 (2016-01-04)-------------------* IMAP source was fixed to work with new IMAPClient's API and  support ``IMAPClient &gt; 1.0.0``.* Datastorage was fixed to get ``filename`` from ``PROCESSOR_DB``  environment variable in case if it was setup using  ``os.environ['PROCESSOR_DB'] = 'some.db'`` after the imports.0.9.0 (2015-12-06)------------------Code was fixed to work with HyLang from ``a3bd90390cb37b46ae33ce3a73ee84a0feacce7d``commit. Please, use this pinned version of HyLang and `subscribe`_ on futurerelease notes to know when this requirement will change... _subscribe: https://allmychanges.com/p/python/processor/0.8.0 (2015-11-16)------------------* Code was fixed to work with latest Hy, from GitHub.* Added ``twitter.mentions`` source, to read stream of mentions from the Twitter.* Fixed a way how number of messages from IMAP folder is limited. Previously  limit was applied even when we already know an ID of the last seen message,  but now limit is ignored in this case and only applied when visiting the  folder first time.0.7.0 (2015-05-05)------------------New output – XMPP was added and now processor is ableto notify Jabber users.0.6.0 (2015-05-01)------------------The biggest change in this release is a new source – ``github.releases``.It is able to read all new releases in given repository and send them intoprocessing pipeline. This works as for public repositories, and for privatetoo. `Read the docs`_ for futher details... _Read the docs: https://python-processor.readthedocs.org/en/latest/sources.html#github-releasesOther changes are:* Storage backend now saves JSON database nicely pretty printed for you could read and edit it in your favorite editor. This is Emacs, right?* Twitter.search source now saves state after the tweet was processed. This way processor shouldn't loose tweets if there was exception somewhere in processing pipeline.* IMAP source was fixed and now is able to fetch emails from really big folders.0.5.0 (2015-04-15)------------------Good news, everyone! New output was added - ``email``.Now Processor is able to notify you via email about any event.0.4.0 (2015-04-06)------------------* Function ``run_pipline`` was simplified and now accepts only one source and one ouput.  To implement more complex pipelines, use ``sources.mix`` and ``outputs.fanout`` helpers.0.3.0 (2015-04-01)------------------* Added a `web.hook`_ source.* Now `source` could be not only a iterable object, but any function which returns values... _web.hook: https://python-processor.readthedocs.org/en/latest/sources.html#web-hook0.2.1 (2015-03-30)------------------Fixed error in ``import-or-error`` macro, which prevented from using 3-party libraries.0.2.0 (2015-03-30)------------------Most 3-party libraries are optional now. If you want to usesome extension which requires external library, it will issuean error and call ``sys.exit(1)`` until you satisfy thisrequirement.This should make life easier for thouse, who does not wantto use ``rss`` output which requires ``feedgen`` which requires``lxml`` which is hard to build because it is C extension.0.1.0 (2015-03-18)------------------* First release on PyPI.</longdescription>

	<longdescription> PySCeS is developed by the Triple-J Group for Molecular Cell Physiology in order to try model and understand the complex processes and systems which make up the living cell.    PySCeS features, amongst other things:    - A text based model description language.    - A structural analysis module.    - Integrators for time simulation    - Non-linear solvers for steady-state analysis    - A module for performing Metabolic Control Analysis    - A bifurcation module for systems which exhibit multiple steady states    - A variety of extra utilites for parameter scans, data output and plotting.    - A dynamic module loading framework.    - SBML import and export capability.    </longdescription>

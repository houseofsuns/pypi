	<longdescription># gherlintLinter for Gherkin feature files, written in Python## InstallSimply run ``pip install gherlint``.## Linting Feature Files``gherlint`` comes with a command line interface.To recursively lint all feature files in a directory, run ``gherlint lint``.## Computing Metrics``gherlint`` can also create some metrics for you if you want to know how many features, scenarios and steps you havein your test suite. To do so, run ``gherlint stats``.## Disclaimer``gherlint`` is still in an early development phase. New checks will be added over time.If you want to contribute, feel free to open issues suggesting useful checkers, or open a pull request if you wantto!## RoadmapThe following work items are planned for the upcoming releases:* V0.0.x - V0.1.0:    * Parser and object model for feature files    * Basic checkers to demonstrate workflow    * Basic text based reporter* V0.1.x - V1.0: **&lt;-- we are here**    * Add more checkers    * Add more output formats    * Extend object model as necessary for checkers    * Reach a stable interface for object model, checkers and reporters* V1.x - V2.0:    * Support configuration to enable/disable individual messages    * Implement plugin architecture to allow users to add custom checkers# CHANGELOG## V0.4.0New checks:* ``unused-parameter``* ``empty-background``* ``outline-could-be-a-scenario``* ``consider-using-background``* ``examples-outside-scenario-outline``* ``duplicated-tag``Other changes:* ``unparseable-file`` is now issued for all nodes that offend the ``gherkin`` parser together with more error information provided by it* ``missing-parameter`` now clearly states what parameter is not defined in the examples* If ``gherlint`` patches the file contents with a forgotten ``# language`` tag the line numbers for messagesare no longer shifted* Types of ``And`` and ``But`` steps are now inferred correctly* New command ``fix-language-tags`` to automatically add or fix missing or incorrect language tags* Rename some message codes to have a defined structure: each checker has its own hundreds digit.## V0.3.0New checks:* ``missing-language-tag``* ``wrong-language-tag``* ``unparseable-file``Other changes:* ``gherlint`` can now automatically detect the language used and make sure that it can parse the fileseven without a ``# language`` token present.## V0.2.0New checks:* ``missing-given-step``* ``missing-when-step``* ``missing-then-step``* ``empty-scenario``* ``empty-feature``* ``file-has-no-feature``* ``missing-parameter``Other changes:* Support for ``Background``* Determination of step type independent of language* Distinction between ``Scenario`` and ``Scenario Outline`` independent of language## V0.1.0First package in alpha status:* Parser and object model for feature files* Basic checkers to demonstrate workflow* Basic text based reporter</longdescription>

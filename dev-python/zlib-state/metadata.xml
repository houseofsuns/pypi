	<longdescription># zlib-stateLow-level interface to the zlib library that enables capturing the decoding state.## InstallFrom PyPi:```pip install zlib-state```From source:```python setup.py install```Tested on ubuntu/macos/windows with python 3.6-3.10.## GzipStateFileWraps Decompressor as a buffered reader.Based on my benchmarking, this is somewhat slower than python's gzip.A typical usage pattern looks like:```pythonimport zlib_stateTARGET_LINE = 5000 # pick back up after around the 5,000th line# Specify keep_last_state=True to tell object to grab and keep the state and pos after each blockwith zlib_state.GzipStateFile('testdata/frankenstein.txt.gz', keep_last_state=True) as f:    for i, line in enumerate(f):        if i == TARGET_LINE:            state, pos = f.last_state, f.last_state_poswith zlib_state.GzipStateFile('testdata/frankenstein.txt.gz') as f:    f.zseek(pos, state)    remainder = f.read()```## DecompressorVery basic decompression object that's picky and unforgiving.Based on my benchmarking, this can iterate over gzip files faster than python's gzip.A typical usage pattern looks like:```pythonimport zlib_statedecomp = zlib_state.Decompressor(32 + 15) # from zlib; 32 indicates gzip header, 15 window sizeblock_count = 0with open('testdata/frankenstein.txt.gz', 'rb') as f:    while not decomp.eof():        needed_input = decomp.needs_input()        if needed_input &gt; 0:            # decomp needs more input, and it tells you how much.            decomp.feed_input(f.read(needed_input))        # next_chunk may be empty (e.g., if finished with gzip headers) or may contain data.        # It sends as much as it has left in its output buffer, or asks zlib to continue.        next_chunk = decomp.read() # you can also pass a maximum size to take and/or a buffer to write to        if decomp.block_boundary():            block_count += 1            # When it reaches the end of a deflate block, it always stops. At these times, you can grab the state            # if you wish.            if block_count == 4: # resume after the 4th block                state = decomp.get_state() # includes zdict, bits, byte -- everything it needs to resume from pos                pos = decomp.total_in() # the current position in the binary file to resume from    print(f'{block_count} blocks processed')    # resume from somewhere in the file. Only possible spots are the block boundaries, given the state    f.seek(pos)    decomp = zlib_state.Decompressor(-15) # from zlib; 15 window size, negative means no headers    decomp.set_state(*state)    while not decomp.eof():        needed_input = decomp.needs_input()        if needed_input &gt; 0:            # decomp needs more input, and it tells you how much.            decomp.feed_input(f.read(needed_input))        next_chunk = decomp.read()```</longdescription>

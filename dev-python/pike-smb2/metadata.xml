The following environment variables are used bythe tests:    PIKE_SERVER=&lt;host name or address&gt;    PIKE_SHARE=&lt;share name&gt;    PIKE_CREDS=DOMAIN\User%Passwd    PIKE_LOGLEVEL=info|warning|error|critical|debug    PIKE_SIGN=yes|no    PIKE_ENCRYPT=yes|no    PIKE_MAX_DIALECT=DIALECT_SMBX_Y_Z    PIKE_MIN_DIALECT=DIALECT_SMBX_Y_Z    PIKE_TRACE=yes|noIf `PIKE_TRACE` is set to `yes` then incoming/outgoing packets will belogged at the debug level.    $ python -m unittest discover -s pike/test -p *.pyAlternatively, to build and run all tests    $ python setup.py testTo run an individual test file    $ python -m unittest discover -s pike/test -p echo.pyTo run an individual test case    $ python -m unittest pike.test.echo.EchoTest.test_echo## Kerberos HintsSetting up MIT Kerberos as provided by many Linux distributions to interoperatewith an existing Active Directory and Pike is relatively simple.If `PIKE_CREDS` is not specified and the kerberos module was built whileinstalling pike then your current Kerberos credentials will be used toauthenticate.Use a minimal `/etc/krb5.conf` on the client such as the following    [libdefaults]        default_realm = AD.EXAMPLE.COMRetrieve a ticket for the desired user    $ kinit user_1(Optional) in leiu of DNS, add host entries for the server name + domain    $ echo &quot;10.1.1.150    smb-server.ad.example.com&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/hostsRun pike tests    $ PIKE_SERVER=&quot;smb-server.ad.example.com&quot; PIKE_SHARE=&quot;C$&quot; python -m unittest discover -s pike/test -p tree.pyNote that you will probably need to specify the server by fully-qualifiedhostname in order for Kerberos to figure out which ticket to use.  If youget errors during session setup when using an IP address, this is probablythe reason.## Decoding BufferOverrunWhen pike encounters a buffer or boundary problem, `BufferOverrun` israised with the full packet bytes. This can be used in two ways.### With PikeFor some problems, it may be necessary to run pike with a debuggerwhile decoding the packet bytes to reproduce runtime parsing or decodingissues.    from binascii import unhexlify    import array    import pike.netbios    buf = array.array(&quot;B&quot;, unhexlify(b'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'))    nb = pike.netbios.Netbios()    nb.parse(buf)### With WiresharkOther decoding problems may be easier to understand by looking at the packetwith a pcap analysis tool.    $ echo '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' \      | xxd -r -p - \      | od -Ax -tx1 -v \      | text2pcap -i46 -T 445,445 - - \      | tshark -P -V -r -- `xxd` decodes the ascii hex bytestream output from the `BufferOverrun` exception into binary- `od` dumps the output to a format [wireshark can read](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChIOImportSection.html)- `text2pcap` (wireshark) appends fake ethernet and IP headers to the SMB packet and writes a pcap file to stdout- `tshark` (wireshark) decodes the SMB packet and displays full packet details## LicenseThis project, _pike_ and _pike-smb2_, is released under a Simplified BSD License granted by Dell Inc.'s Open Source Project program,except code under `pykerb/` which is released under an Apache 2.0 License granted by Apple Inc.&lt;br /&gt;All project contributions are entirely reflective of the respective author(s) and not of Dell Inc. or Apple Inc.See file [LICENSE](LICENSE) for licensing information.## OtherThere is older [API documentation from epydoc](http://emc-isilon.github.io/pike/api/index.html).Pike, with the exception of pykerb and certain build scripts(see below), is licensed under Simplified BSD License as follows:  Copyright © 2013-2020, Dell Inc. or its subsidiaries.

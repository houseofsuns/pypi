	<longdescription># blueye.protocol[![Tests](https://github.com/BluEye-Robotics/blueye.protocol/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/BluEye-Robotics/blueye.protocol/actions)**Deprecation notice**Blunux 3.0 introduces a new protocol based on [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) messages passed over a [ZeroMQ](https://zeromq.org/) layer. Starting with Blunux 3.1 the old TCP/UDP based protocol will no longer be supported/compatible.## AboutThis repository contains a python library that defines how to communicate with the underwater drones made by [Blueye Robotics](https://blueyerobotics.com).The protocol itself is defined in another repository, [ProtocolDefinitions](https://github.com/BluEye-Robotics/ProtocolDefinitions), as is stored as a submodule in this repository. The python code in this repository is (mostly) generated from those definitions.The `blueye.protocol` package's primary use case is in the [`blueye.sdk`](https://github.com/BluEye-Robotics/blueye.sdk). The SDK implements the necessary &quot;plumbing&quot; to utilize the protocol defined here in `blueye.protocol`, and will make interacting with the Blueye drones much easier. If you wish to interact with the drones in your own project we recommend using the `blueye.sdk` package, not `blueye.protocol` directly.This package requires Python 3.8 or newer.## Installation```shellpip install blueye.protocol```## Development### Dependency/Package managementWe use Poetry for dependency/package management, see the [Poetry docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for installation instructions.### Code generators**Important**: This repository includes generated code. If the protocol definitions are changed the generated files need to be updated and committed. The generators are run with:`invoke generate-udp``invoke generate-tcp``invoke generate-proto`### TestsThe tests are located in the `tests` folder, and written using the `pytest` library.The tests can be run using invoke (to ensure that the protocol files are updated)``` shellinvoke test```or directly using pytest (if you don't want to generate the definitions)``` shellpytest```### `setup.py`Since bitbake doesn't have support for pyproject.toml files yet, we need to include a`setup.py` file to specify the dependencies needed. There's an invoke task forgenerating the file that can be run with``` shellinvoke generate-setup-py```**Be sure to run this script and commit the `setup.py` file when the dependencies havechanged.**</longdescription>

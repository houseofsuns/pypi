	<longdescription>---title: MathTextapp_file: app.pysdk: gradiosdk_version: 3.15.0license: agpl-3.0---## MathText NLUNatural Language Understanding for math symbols, digits, and words with a Gradio user interface and REST API.## Setup your Python environmentLaunch a `terminal` on linux (or the `git-bash` application on Windows).Then create a virtualenv with whatever python version you have available on your system.Any python version greater than `3.7` should work.Most of us on Linux systems use Python `3.9`: ```bashgit clone git@gitlab.com:tangibleai/community/mathtextcd mathtextpip install --upgrade virtualenv poetrypython -m virtualenv .venvls -hal```You should see a new `.venv/` directory.It will contain your python interpreter and a few `site-packages` like `pip` and `distutils`.Now activate your new virtual environment by sourcing `.venv/bin/activate` (on Linux) or `.venv/scripts/activate` (on Windows).```bashsource .venv/bin/activate || source .venv/scripts/activate```## Developer installationOnce you have a shiny new virtual environment activated you can install the `mathtext` in `--editable` mode.This way, when you edit the files and have the package change immediately.Make sure you are already within your cloned `mathtext` project directory.And makes sure your virtual environment is activated.You should see the name of your virtual environment in parentheses within your command line prompt, like `(.venv) $`.Then when you install MathText it will be available to any other application within that environment.```bashpip install --editable .```## User installationIf you don't want to contribute to the MathText source code and you just want to import and run the MathText modules, you can install it from a binary wheel on PyPi.```bashpip install mathtext```## File notes    mathtext        mathtext: mathtext code            data: training and test sets for various tasks            api_gradio.py: gradio api            api_scaling.py: makes async http requests to the local api            nlutils_vish.py: various NLP utils            nlutils.py: various NLP utils            plot_calls.py: Functions for plotting data            readme.md: other readme?            sentiment.py: sets up huggingface sentiment analysis pipeline for the api (gradio or FastAPI?)            tag_numbers.py: Number and word POS tagger            text2int.py: text2int function        scripts: setup scripts            build.sh            pyproject.template        tests: various tests            __init.py            test_text2int.py        .git*: various git files        api_scaling.sh: makes calls to local api        app.py: ties all of the api components together for huggingface        LICENSE.md: license        pyproject.toml: pyproject file        README.md: this        requirements.txt: project dependencies            </longdescription>

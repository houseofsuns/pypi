	<longdescription># wks: Simple CMake workspace manager## How it worksThe basic purpose of `wks` is to spawn repositories to build a project, then generate a `CMakeLists.txt`containing `add_subdirectory()` directives for all of them.This way, the project can be built using the top-level generated `CMakeLists.txt`.## UsageThe following commands are available:* `wks install [repository]`: If a repository is given, `wks` will install it first. Then, `wks` will scan for  dependencies in the `wks.yml` files (see below) and install them until all requirements are met. This way, it is  possible that dependencies of dependencies are installed. Calling `wks install` without repository argument will  cause dependencies scan. The `CMakeLists.txt` will eventually be generated.* `wks cmake`: This will cause the `CMakeLists.txt` to be re-generated.* `wks build [target]`: Will create a build and run it. `wks` will try to create a Ninja build, and  fall back to makefiles if it is not available. The `[target]` you can pass will be given to the build command  (`make [target]` or `ninja [target]`). The build will be stored in `build/` directory.* `wks pull`: Will run a `git pull` in all repositories. This will then scan for dependencies (equivalent to `wks install`  with no argument) and re-generate the `CMakeLists.txt`.* `wks status`: Gives insight on the status of your repositories, this will check for:  * Untracked files  * Changes without commits  * Changes commited but not pushedAll sources will be stored in `src/`, under `src/vendor/repository`.## Repositories formatAll repositories are fetched for GitHub, and repositories can have those formats:* `vendor/repository`* `vendor/repository#branch`* `vendor/repository@tag`## The `wks.yml` fileThe `wks.yml` can contain the following sections:* `deps`: a list of dependencies that the repository want to be installed* `optional`: a list of optional dependencies, they will not be installed but it ensure that the projects will appear  in the proper order in the generated `CMakeLists.txt`* `cmakes`: if the `CMakeLists.txt` for this repository is not at the top level (or not unique), you can specify them  using this section* `install`: a list of shell command that should be run post install* `cmake_prefix`: a list of directories to be added to `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`An example is:```yamldeps:    - rhoban/utils@v1.0    - rhoban/geometry@v2.0cmakes:    - client    - server```</longdescription>

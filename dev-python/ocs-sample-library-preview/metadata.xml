	<longdescription># AVEVA Data Hub Python Library Sample| :loudspeaker: **Notice**: This library is being deprecated to be replaced by the AVEVA Data Hub branded [*adh_sample_library_preview*](https://github.com/osisoft/sample-adh-sample_libraries-python) library. Version 0.7.1_preview of this library installs [*adh_sample_library_preview*](https://github.com/osisoft/sample-adh-sample_libraries-python) as a dependency. || -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  **Version:** 0.7.1_preview[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/osieng/engineering/_apis/build/status/product-readiness/ADH/aveva.sample-ocs-sample_libraries-python?branchName=main)](https://dev.azure.com/osieng/engineering/_build/latest?definitionId=2622&amp;branchName=main)This sample library requires Python 3.7+. You can download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).- __NOTE__: The library previously required Python 3.9+ to take advantage of type annotations. To provide compatibility with environments that cannot upgrade Python to 3.9, `from __future__ import annotations` was added to each necessary file. [This provides backwards compatibility down to Python 3.7](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__future__.html).## About the libraryThe python ADH library is an introductory language-specific example of programming against Aveva Data Hub ([ADH](https://www.osisoft.com/Solutions/OSIsoft-Cloud-Services/)). It is intended as instructional samples only and are not for production use. *The samples also work on OSIsoft Cloud Services unless otherwise noted.*They can be obtained by running: `pip install ocs_sample_library_preview`The library is not intended to show every endpoint and every option/parameter for endpoints it has. The library is known to be incomplete.Other language libraries and samples are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/osisoft/OSI-Samples).Tests are done by testing the sample apps that use this.---Developed using Python 3.9.5.[AVEVA Samples](https://github.com/osisoft/OSI-samples) are licensed under the Apache 2 license.For the main ADH sample libraries page [ReadMe](https://github.com/osisoft/OSI-Samples-OCS/blob/main/docs/SAMPLE_LIBRARIES.md)  For the main ADH samples page [ReadMe](https://github.com/osisoft/OSI-Samples-OCS)  For the main AVEVA samples page [ReadMe](https://github.com/osisoft/OSI-Samples)</longdescription>

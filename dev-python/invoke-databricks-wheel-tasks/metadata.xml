Then run the following command:```shdatabricks configure --profile yourprofilename --tokenDatabricks Host (should begin with https://): https://myorganisation.cloud.databricks.com/Token: ```Which will create a configuration file in your home directory at `~/.databrickscfg` like:```shcat ~/.databrickscfg[yourprofilename]host = https://myorganisation.cloud.databricks.com/token = dapi0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdefjobs-api-version = 2.1```### Environment VariablesOn some CI systems it is better to export secrets into environment variables rather than have config files with secrets on CI servers.Export the following and the `databricks-cli` will pick it up:```iniDATABRICKS_HOST=https://myorganisation.cloud.databricks.com/DATABRICKS_TOKEN=dapi0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdefDATABRICKS_JOBS_API_VERSION=&quot;2.1```## Invoke Setup`tasks.py````pythonfrom invoke import taskfrom invoke_databricks_wheel_tasks import * # noqa```Once your `tasks.py` is setup like this `invoke` will have the extra commands:```shλ invoke --listAvailable tasks:  dbfs-wheel-path        Generate the target path (including wheelname) this wheel should be uploaded to.  dbfs-wheel-path-root   Generate the target path (excluding wheelname) this wheel should be uploaded to.  define-job             Generate templated Job definition and upsert by Job Name in template.  poetry-wheel-name      Display the name of the wheel file poetry would build.  run-job                Trigger default job associated for this project.  upload                 Upload wheel artifact to DBFS.```# The Tasks## uploadThis task will use `dbfs` to empty the upload path and then copy the built wheel from `dist/`.This project assumes you're using `poetry` or your wheel build output is located in `dist/`.If you have other requirements then _pull requests welcome_.## define-jobYou may want to run `invoke --help define-job` to get the help documentation.There are a few arguments that get abbreviated which we will explain before discussing how they work together. - `--jinja-template` or `-j`: This is a [Jinja2 Template](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/) that must resolve to a valid [Databricks Jobs JSON payload](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/latest/jobs.html#) spec. - `--config-file` or `-c`: This is either a JSON or YAML file to define the config, that gets used to parametrise the above `jinja-template`. This `config-file` can also be a Jinja template to inject values that can only be known at runtime like the git feature branch you are currently on. By default it is treated as a plain config file and not a Jinja Template unless `environment-variable` flags are specified (_see next_). - `--environment-variable` or `-e`: This flag can be repeated many times to specify multiple values. It takes a string in the `key=value` format.     - Eg `-e branch=$(git branch --show-current) -e main_wheel=$MAIN -e utils_wheel=$UTILS`So an example command could look like:```shinvoke define-job \    -j jobs/base-job-template.json.j2 \    -c jobs/customer360-etl-job.yaml \    -e branch=$(git branch --show-current) \    -e main_whl=$(invoke dbfs-wheel-path) \    -e utils_whl=$UTILS_DBFS_WHEEL_PATH```Then the `-e` values can get templated into `customer360-etl-job.yml`. Then that YAML file gets parsed and injected into `base-job-template.json.j2`This will then check the list of Jobs in your workspace, see if a job with the same name exists already and perform a _create or replace job_ operation. This expects the `config-file` to have a key `name` to be able to cross check the list of existing jobs.**The beauty is that the specifics of `config-file` and `jinja-template` is completely up to you.**`config-file` is the minimal datastructure you need to configure `jinja-template` and you just use the [Jinja Control Structures](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/templates/#list-of-control-structures) (`if-else`, `for-loop`, etc) to traverse it and populate `jinja-template`.## run-jobThis will create a manual trigger of your job with `job-id`.The triggering returns a `run-id`, where this `run-id` gets polled until the state gets to an end state.Then a call to `databricks runs get-output --run-id` happens to retrieve and `error`, `error_trace` and/or `logs` to be emitted to console.# ContributingAt all times, you have the power to fork this project, make changes as you see fit and then:```shpip install https://github.com/user/repository/archive/branch.zip```[Stackoverflow: pip install from github branch](https://stackoverflow.com/a/24811490/622276)That way you can run from your own custom fork in the interim or even in-house your work and simply use this project as a starting point. That is totally ok.However if you would like to contribute your changes back, then open a Pull Request &quot;across forks&quot;.Once your changes are merged and published you can revert to the canonical version of `pip install`ing this package.If you're not sure how to make changes or if you should sink the time and effort, then open an Issue instead and we can have a chat to triage the issue.# Resources - [`pyinvoke`](https://pyinvoke.org) - [`databricks-cli`](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/cli/index.html)# Prior Art - https://github.com/Smile-SA/invoke-sphinx - https://github.com/Dashlane/dbt-invoke</longdescription>

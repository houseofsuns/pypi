	<longdescription># Local Emulator for Google Cloud StorageGoogle doesn't (yet) ship an emulator for the Cloud Storage API like they do forCloud Datastore.This is a stub emulator so you can run your tests and do local development withouthaving to connect to the production Storage APIs.**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND ONLY SUPPORTS A LIMITED SUBSET OF THE API**---## Looking for Commercial Support?Potato offers Commercial Support for all its Open Source projects and we can tailor a support package to your needs.If you're interested in commercial support, training, or consultancy then go ahead and contact us at [opensource@potatolondon.com](mailto:opensource@potatolondon.com)---## Installation`pip install gcloud-storage-emulator`## CLI Usage### Starting the emulatorStart the emulator with:```bash$ gcloud-storage-emulator start --port=9090```By default, data is stored under `$PWD/.cloudstorage`. You can configure the folder using the env variables `STORAGE_BASE` and `STORAGE_DIR`.If you wish to run the emulator in a testing environment or if you don't want to persist any data, you can use the `--no-store-on-disk` parameter. For tests, you might want to consider starting up the server from your code (see the [Python APIs](#python-apis))If you're using the Google client library (e.g. `google-cloud-storage` for Python) then you can set the `STORAGE_EMULATOR_HOST` environment variable to tell the library to connect to your emulator endpoint rather than the standard `https://storage.googleapis.com`, e.g.:```bash$ export STORAGE_EMULATOR_HOST=http://localhost:9090```### Wiping dataYou can wipe the data by running```bash$ gcloud-storage-emulator wipe```You can pass `--keep-buckets` to wipe the data while keeping the buckets.## Python APIsTo start a server from your code you can do```pythonfrom gcloud_storage_emulator.server import create_serverserver = create_server(&quot;localhost&quot;, 9023, in_memory=False)server.start()# ........server.stop()```You can wipe the data (e.g. for text execution) by calling `server.wipe()`This can also be achieved (e.g. during tests) by hitting the `/wipe` endpoint## Running Tests### With ToxIf you have Tox installed then you can run tests with:```bashtox -e py37 -- {extra_pytest_args}```### With DockerIf you don't have Tox installed on your system but you do have Docker, then you can run the tests using the [themattrix/tox](https://github.com/themattrix/docker-tox) image:```bashdocker run -v /ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/THIS/REPO/ON/YOUR/MACHINE:/app themattrix/tox tox -e py37 [optional additional args for tox...]```### With unittest* Create and activate a virtualenv (optional but recommended)* `cd` into the repository directory* `pip install -e`* `python -m unittest gcloud_storage_emulator.tests`</longdescription>

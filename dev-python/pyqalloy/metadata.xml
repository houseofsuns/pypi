The [ULTERA Project](https://ultera.org), along is led by [Phases Research Lab](https://phaseslab.com) at Penn State. As a part of it, we developed a new large-scale database of high entropy alloys (HEAs) reported in the literaturealong with their experimental properties. As of March 2023, the database containsaround 6,000 property data points of 2,500 HEAs coming from almost 500 publications. It iscurrently the largest database of HEAs in the world, and while it is not publicly availablewe welcome collaborators who would like to use it in their research or contribute to it.ULTERA Database is not simply a dataset but features a robust set of data processing, curation, and aggregation tools we built for the last 3 years. These tools allowed us to remove around the 5-10% erroneous data we identified in datasets available in the literature.Most of our tools are not published yet, as the project is ongoing (they give us a competitiveadvantage), and because most of the tools require an elaborate computing infrastructure setup.However, as some of them are less-infrastructure-demanding and are, at the same timehighly applicable outside HEAs, we decided to release them as separate packages. This repositorycontains the first of such packages, **PyQAlloy**, which is a Python package for detecting dataabnormalities in datasets of arbitrary alloys, ranging from complex, concentrated solutions, i.e.High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) / Multi Principle Element Alloys (MPEAs) / Concentrated Complex Alloys (CCAs) to more traditional alloys such as steels, nickel-based superalloys, etc.## Installation### Basic (as a library)PyQAlloy is readily available on PyPI (since V0.3.5), and you can get it with a simple:    pip install pyqalloyOnce the installation process is complete, you will be able to utilize it in your Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks.### Development (recommended)**To get a ready-to-go installation of PyQAlloy with all notebooks in this repository, it is recommendedto install it in development mode** - that is to clone the repository and install it in editable mode. While not required, it is recommended to first set up a virtual environment using venv or Conda. This ensures that one of the required versions of Python (3.9+) is used and there are no dependency conflicts. If you have Conda installed on your system (see instructions at https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), you can create a new environment with:    conda create -n pyqalloy python=3.9 jupyter    conda activate pyqalloyThen, clone PyQAlloy from GitHub like    git clone https://github.com/PhasesResearchLab/PyQAlloy.gitPlease note this will, by default, download the latest development version of the software, which may not be stable. For a stable version, you can specify a version tag after the URL with `--branch &lt;tag_name&gt; --single-branch`.Then, move to the PyQAlloy folder and install in editable (`-e`) mode.    cd PyQAlloy    pip install -e .### Database Access If you are using the [**ULTERA Project**](https://ultera.org) infrastructure, now you should fill in your details into the `pyqalloy/credentials.json` with `name`, `dbKey`, and `dataServer` fields, and you should be ready to go as the most current stable version will be kept up-to-date with the latest stable snapshot of ULTERA! :)## Getting Started ### If you have ULTERA accessYou can start by going through the `UserCuration.ipynb` notebook. It will guide you throughall core functionalities of PyQAlloy.### If you are not using the ULTERA infrastructure You will need to set up your own MongoDB database or another tool&quot;pretending&quot; to be one and fill it with data that conforms to the ULTERA schema. You can do it either manually(instructions will be provided in the future, and we are happy to help you get started today) or by usinga snapshot of the ULTERA database subset `devTools/ULTERA_sample.bson` if you only want to learn how to use PyQAlloyfor now.Start with `CustomDatasetFromBSON.ipynb` notebook which will show you how to create a custom MontyDB in-memory databasefrom a BSON file (or JSON if you prefer). Then, you can modify the `UserCuration.ipynb` notebook to use your custom database and work through all exercises there.### Minimal SnippetTo give a taste of PyQAlloy's interface, here is a minimal snippet that will utilize the ULTERA database andscan it for datapoints uploaded by `Adam Krajewski` (who also happens to write this README) with the uncertainty of 2.1% (i.e. how much a composition can deviate from 100% to be considered a valid composition) and print the first 10results on the fly as they are found.```pythonfrom pyqalloy.curation import analysissC = analysis.SingleCompositionAnalyzer(name='Adam Krajewski')sC.scanCompositionsAround100(    printOnFly=True,     resultLimit=10,     uncertainty=0.21)```</longdescription>

	<longdescription># Bitvavo API (upgraded)Hi, this is *not* the official API, but this one has:- build-in documentation- typing for *all* functions and classes- unit tests (I already found ~~three~~ ~~four~~ ~~five~~ six bugs that I fixed, because the original code wasn't tested, at all)- a changelog, so you can track of the changes that I make- compatible with Python 3.7 and newer ([3.6 isn't supported as of 2021-12-23](https://endoflife.date/python))- a working version of `getRemainingLimit()`- will actually wait until the ban has been lifted (in case you get banned)- more stable api-calls, due to calculating lag between client and server- fancy logging via `structlog`, including external loggers like from the urllib3 and websocket libs!- a working `ACCESSWINDOW` variable that actually times the api calls out - makes failing Bitvavo API calls fail faster!Version `1.*` is guaranteed compatible\* with the original API.\*: Except for `Bitvavo.candles`. I had to renamed the `symbol` argument to `market`, because the `candles` call actually excpects a `market`. So that's more of a bugfix.\*\*: Same goes for `Bitvavo.book`; it had the same problem as `candles`.\*\*\*: And I removed the `rateLimitThread` class, but that should've been used internally only anyway## Customizable settingsThrough the magic of the python-decouple lib, when you use this lib, you can create a `settings.ini` (Windows [example](https://pypi.org/project/python-decouple/#ini-file)) or a `.env` (Linux [example](https://pypi.org/project/python-decouple/#env-file)) and add some handy settings there.Here is an example list of the settings for this lib:```iniBITVAVO_API_UPGRADED_LOG_LEVEL=INFO  # Set the lib's log levelBITVAVO_API_UPGRADED_LOG_EXTERNAL_LEVEL=WARNING  # Set the libs that are used by *this* lib's log levelBITVAVO_API_UPGRADED_LAG=50  # the time difference between the server and your local time (you'll have to calculate this yourself - tip: use the bitvavo.time() functionality in a separate script)BITVAVO_API_UPGRADED_RATE_LIMITING_BUFFER=25  # default 25, set to 50 if you get &quot;you have been banned&quot; messages (or even higher, if needed)```## Links- [Official API Documentation](https://docs.bitvavo.com/)- [Official Trading Rules](https://bitvavo.com/en/trading-rules) (recommended read, as it explains a lot of jargon; It's OK to not understand this document if you're just starting out - I don't fully understand the document either)- [Github for this lib](https://github.com/Thaumatorium/bitvavo-api-upgraded)</longdescription>

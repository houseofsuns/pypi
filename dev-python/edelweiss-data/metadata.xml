	<longdescription>This python client library allows easy access to [Edelweiss Data](https://www.saferworldbydesign.com/edelweissdata) servers.# Table of Contents- [Overview](#overview)- [Getting started](#getting-started)  - [Requirements](#requirements)  - [Installation](#installation)- [Common use cases](#common-use-cases)  - [Initialization](#initialization)  - [Authentication](#authentication)  - [Create a new dataset](#create-a-new-dataset)  - [Search for datasets](#search-for-datasets)  - [Filter and retrieve data](#filter-and-retrieve-data)  - [Delete a new dataset](#delete-a-dataset)- [API reference](#api-reference)# OverviewThe core concept of Edelweiss Data is that of a **Dataset**. A Dataset is a single table of data (usually originating from a csv file) and carries the following additional pieces of information:* a **schema** describing the structure of the tabular data (data types, explanatory text for each column etc)* a human readable **description text** (markdown formatted - like the readme of a repository on github)* a **metadata json** structure (of arbitrary complexity - this can be used to store things like author information, instrument settings used to generate the data, ...).Datasets are **versioned** through a processes called publishing. Once a version of a dataset is published, it is &quot;frozen&quot; and becomes immutable. Any change to it has to be done by creating a new version. Users of Edelweiss Data will always see the version history of a dataset and be able to ask for the latest version or specific earlier version.Datasets can be public or **access restricted**. Public datasets can be accessed without any access restrictions. To access restricted datasets or to upload/edit your own dataset OpenIDConnect/OAuth is used - in the python client this process is done by calling the authenticate method on the Api instance that triggers a web based login at the end of which a token is confirmed.When retrieving the tabular data of a dataset, the data can be **filtered and ordered** and only specific columns requested - this makes request for subsets of data much faster than if all filtering happened only on the client. Conditions for filtering and ordering are created by constructing QueryExpression instances using classmethods on the QueryExpression class to create specific Expressions. You can access the data either in it's raw form (as json data) or, more conveniently, as a Pandas Dataframe.Just like the tabular data of one particular dataset can be retrieved as a **Pandas DataFrame**, you can also query for datasets using the same filtering and ordering capabilities - i.e. you can retrieve a DataFrame where each row represents a Dataset with it's name, description and optionally metadata and schema (not including the data though).When you are searching for Datasets, a lot of the interesting information that you may want to filter by is hidden in the **metadata** (e.g. maybe most of your datasets have a metadata field &quot;Species&quot; at the top level of the metadata json that indicates from what kind of animal cells the data in this dataset originate from). To make such filtering easy, our Datasets query function take an optional list of &quot;column mappings&quot; that allow you to specify a **JsonPath expression** to extract a field from the metadata and include it with a given name in the resulting DataFrame. In the Species example, you could pass the list of column mappings [(&quot;Species from Metadata&quot;, &quot;$.Species&quot;)] and the resulting DataFrame would contain an additional column &quot;Species from Metadata&quot; and for every row the result of evaluating the JsonPath $.Species would be included in this column and you could filter on it using conditions to e.g. only retrieve Datasets where the Species is set to &quot;Mouse&quot;.Edelweiss Data servers provide a rich **User Interface** as well that let's you visually browse and filter datasets and the data (and associated information) of each dataset. This UI is built to integrate nicely with the python client. The DataExplorer that is used to explore a dataset has a button in the upper right corner to generate the python code to get the exact same filtering and ordering you see in the UI into a Pandas DataFrame using the Edelweiss Data library for your convenience.# More information and examplesThe [official EdelweissData documentation](https://edelweissdata.com/docs/about) has more in-depth information about the various parts of EdelweissData.In the [examples directory of this libraries Github page](https://github.com/DouglasConnect/edelweiss-data-python/tree/master/examples) you can find several Jupyter notebooks which repeat the walkthroughs from the official EdelweissData documentation but using the edelweiss_data library instead of direct HTTP calls shown with JavaScript.# Getting started## RequirementsPython 3.6+## Installation```bashpip install edelweiss_data```# Common use casesIn addition to the brief overview below, do check out the [examples directory of this libraries Github page](https://github.com/DouglasConnect/edelweiss-data-python/tree/master/examples) that contains several Jupyter notebooks demonstrating common operations and showing e.g. all possible filter operators in use.## InitializationYou interact with the Edelweiss Data API mainly via the API class of the edelweiss_data python library. Import it, point it at the Edelweiss Data instance you want to interact with and instantiate it like this:```pythonfrom edelweiss_data import API, QueryExpression as Q# Set this to the url of the Edelweiss Data server you want to interact withedelweiss_api_url = 'https://api.develop.edelweiss.douglasconnect.com'api = API(edelweiss_api_url)```## AuthenticationSome operations in Edelweiss Data are accessible without authentication (e.g. retrieving public datasets). For others (e.g. to create datasets), you need to be authenticated. Authentication is done with the authenticate call. Be aware that this call is currently built for interactive use like in a Jupyter environment - it will block execution for a up to a few minutes while it waits for you to log in to your account and confirm the access to the API on your behalf. Once accepted the python client will store the authentication token so that you will not have to enter it again for a few days (the token is stored in your home directory in the .edelweiss directory).```pythonapi.authenticate()```## Create a new datasetCreating and publishing a new dataset form a csv file can be done in one quick operation like so:```pythonmetadata = {&quot;metadata-dummy-string&quot;: &quot;string value&quot;, &quot;metadata-dummy-number&quot;: 42.0}with open ('FILENAME') as f:    dataset = api.create_published_dataset_from_csv_file(&quot;DATASETNAME&quot;, f, metadata)```This creates a new dataset form the file FILENAME with the name DATASETNAME. A trivial example metadata is used here as well.When creating and publishing datasets like this you don't have a lot of control over details of the schema or to set a more elaborate dataset description. If you need more control, you can create a dataset like so:```pythondatafile = '../../tests/Serialization/data/small1.csv'name = 'My dataset'schemafile = None # if none, schema will be inferred belowmetadata = None # dict object that will be serialized to json or Nonemetadatafile = None # path to the metadata file or Nonedescription = &quot;This is a *markdown* description that can use [hyperlinks](https://edelweissconnect.com)&quot;dataset1 = api.create_in_progress_dataset(name)print('DATASET:', dataset1)try:    with open(datafile) as f:        dataset1.upload_data(f)    if schemafile is not None:        print('uploading schema from file ...')        with open(schemafile) as f:            dataset1.upload_schema_file(f)    else:        print('inferring schema from file ...')        dataset1.infer_schema()    if metadata is not None:        print('uploading metadata ...')        dataset1.upload_metadata(metadata)    elif metadatafile is not None:        print('uploading metadata from file ...')        with open(metadatafile) as f:            dataset1.upload_metadata_file(f)    dataset1.set_description(description)    published_dataset = dataset1.publish('My first commit')    print('DATASET published:',published_dataset)except requests.HTTPError as err:    print('not published: ', err.response.text)```## Filter and retrieve dataThe tabular data of an individual dataset can be retrieved into a pandas dataframe easily like this:```pythondataframe = dataset.get_data()```You can also filter and order data with QueryExpressions, often aliased to Q in the import statement. In the following example we assume the data to have a column &quot;Species&quot; which we want to filter to the value &quot;Mouse&quot; with fuzzy text matching and &quot;Chemical name&quot; which we want to order by ascending:```pythondataframe = dataset.get_data(condition=Q.fuzzy_search(Q.column(&quot;Species&quot;), &quot;Mouse&quot;), order_by=[Q.column(&quot;Chemical name&quot;)])```In this example you can see how to do a chemical substructure search so that only molecules with the fragment &quot;CC=O&quot; are returned and the results are sorted descending by similarity to the molecule &quot;C(C(CO)(CO)N)O&quot;. Chemical similarity for ordering is calculated using the rdkit library using tanimoto distance between rdkit fingerprints (other fingerprints or distance metrics could be supported in the future)```pythondataframe = dataset.get_data(condition=Q.substructure_search(&quot;CC=O&quot;, Q.column(&quot;SMILES&quot;)), order_by=[Q.tanimoto_similarity(&quot;C(C(CO)(CO)N)O&quot;, Q.column(&quot;SMILES&quot;))], ascending=False)```## Search for datasetsTo just retrieve a pandas dataframe with all published datasets that you are allowed to see use get_published_datasets(). This will return a pandas dataframe with a multiindex of the dataset id and version and then a single object column for the dataset class instance. This class instance can be used to retrieve e.g. the name property of the dataset or it can be used to retrieve the data for this dataset by calling the .get_data() method or similar operations.```pythondatasets = api.get_published_datasets()dataset = datasets.iloc[0].datasetprint(&quot;Found {} datasets. The name of the first is: &quot;.format(len(datasets), dataset.name))```To retrieve a single dataset by index value rather than based on numerical position use the pandas multiindex functionality passing in tuples:```pythondatasetid = '49fd99ee-ec6f-44df-a8cd-73f0f8bbcd76' # example dataset IDversion = 1dataset = datasets.loc[(datasetid, version)]```Just like above with data you can use QueryExpressions to filter to only find datasets matching certain predicates. Below we filter on datasets that have the string &quot;LTKB&quot; somewhere in them (name etc)```pythondatasets_filter = Q.search_anywhere(&quot;LTKB&quot;)datasets = api.get_published_datasets(condition=datasets_filter)```Since very often the most interesting filter and sort critieria will be in the metadata (which is a Json of arbitrary structure), the Api gives you a way to add additional columns by extracting pieces from the metadata json with JsonPath expressions. Below we attempt to treat the metadata json of each dataset as an object with a key &quot;Species&quot; and if it is present we extract it and map it into the &quot;Species from metadata json&quot; column:```pythoncolumns = [(&quot;Species from metadata json&quot;, &quot;$.Species&quot;)]datasets = api.get_published_datasets(columns=columns)```The result of such a query will always be a column containing lists of results as the jsonpath query could return not just a single primitive value or null or an object but also json arrays. Working with columns that contain lists in Pandas can be a bit awkward as some operations like filtering default to operating on series instead of individual cells. For cases like these, working with the Pandas apply method usually makes things easier - e.g. if you want to extract the first element if any from the above column this an easy way to do it that also extends well to more complex operations:```pythondatasets['first_species_or_none'] = datasets.apply(lambda row: row['Species from metadata json'][0] if len(row['Species from metadata json']) &gt; 0 else None, axis=1)```## Delete a datasetTo delete a dataset and all versions call delete_all_versions:```pythondataset.delete_all_versions()```# API reference## `API`The central interaction point with EdelweissData. You instantiate this class with the base url of theEdelweissData server you want to interact with. The __init__ method will verify that the server is reachableand speaks a compatible API version, then you can use instance methods to interact with the API server.### `add_dataset_group_permission`Add a group to a dataset**dataset_id**  : *the id of the dataset***group**  : *the Group to add*### `add_dataset_user_permission`Add a user to a dataset**dataset_id**  : *the id of the dataset***user**  : *the User to add*### `authenticate`### `change_dataset_visibility`Set if the dataset should be public or access protected when published**dataset_id**  : *the id of the dataset***is_public**  : *boolean to indicate if the dataset should be public*### `create_in_progress_dataset`Creates a new in-progress dataset on the server and returns it.**Returns:** The InProgressDataset that was created.**name**  : *the name of the dataset to create*### `create_in_progress_dataset_from_csv_file`Creates a new in-progress dataset from a CSV file on the server.**Returns:** the updated dataset**name**  : *the name of the dataset***file**  : *opened text file to read the csv data from***metadata**  : *dict of the metadata to store as json together with the dataset***description**  : *description text for the dataset (markdown formatted)***is_public**  : *flag to indicate if the dataset should be public or access restricted after publishing*### `create_published_dataset_from_csv_file`Creates a new published dataset from a CSV file on the server.**Returns:** the published dataset**name**  : *the name of the dataset***file**  : *opened text file to read the csv data from***metadata**  : *dict of the metadata to store as json together with the dataset***changelog**  : *Publishing message to store for the first version***description**  : *description text for the dataset (markdown formatted)***is_public**  : *flag to indicate if the dataset should be public or access restricted after publishing*### `delete`Sends a DELETE request to a server.**Returns:** dict with the JSON response.**route**  : *route to which the request will be sent*### `get`Sends a GET request to a server.**Returns:** dict with the JSON response.**route**  : *route to which the request will be sent***json**  : *dict with the JSON body to send*### `get_dataset_permissions`Get the permissions for the given dataset id**Returns:** the DatasetPermissions instance for this dataset**dataset_id**  : *the id of the dataset*### `get_in_progress_dataset`Returns an in-progress datasets with a given id.**Returns:** an InProgressDataset**id**  : *the id of the dataset to retrieve*### `get_in_progress_datasets`Returns a list of all in-progress datasets you are allowed to access (needs authentication).**Returns:** a list of InProgressDatasets**limit**  : *Number of datasets to retrieve - if None (default) it will retrieve all.***offset**  : *Starting offset from which to retrieve the datasets*### `get_published_dataset`Returns a published dataset with a given id and version.**Returns:** the PublishedDataset**id**  : *id of the dataset to retrieve***version**  : *version of the dataset to retrieve.

	<longdescription># gpush`gpush` is a command line utility for standardising commit messages using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). It is designed to be used in conjunction with [python-semantic-release](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to automate the release of your python package based on commits that are made on a branch when a PR is merged.## Signing commits`gpush` natively supports signing commits using GPG. To enable this, you will need to have GPG installed and configured on your machine. You can find instructions on how to do this [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key).# InstallationThis package is available for installation via pypi using pip3:```pip3 install gpush```# UsageWhen running gpush in a git directory, use `gpush` to replace your standard `git commit &amp;&amp; git push` commands. `gpush` will ask a few questions to determine detail about your commit and generate a conventionally formatted git commit message.## Example![&quot;gpush_demo&quot;](docs/gpush_demo.gif)To see additional options available, run gpush with the  `--help` flag```gpush --help```# Local developmentTo develop locally, uninstall any existing version of gpush before executing the pip3 installation in the local directory, use Makefile command to do this:```make dev```# Unit testsTo run unit tests, execute the following command, you will need to have pytest installed and set environmentvariable `GITHUB_TOKEN` to a valid GitHub token that has permissions to create/delete and push to a repositorywithin your account.```make test```The unit tests will create a test repository within your account for each unit test before testing functionality and deleting the repository.# python-semantic-release`gpush` generates commit messages that are compliant with [python-semantic-release](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This allows you to automate the release of your python package using GitHub Actions.To use python-semantic-release, you will need to create a GitHub Action workflow that runs on the `main` branch. The workflow will need to checkout the code, install python-semantic-release and then run the release command. The following is an example workflow that will run on the `main` branch and release a new version of your package and push to PyPI when a PR is merged.You will need to create a PyPI token and add it to your GitHub repository secrets (As `PYPI_TOKEN`). You can find instructions on how to do this [here](https://packaging.python.org/guides/publishing-package-distribution-releases-using-github-actions-ci-cd-workflows/#publishing-to-pypi).## .github/workflow/release.yml```yamlname: Semver Bumpon:  push:    branches:      - &quot;main&quot;jobs:  auto-semver:    runs-on: &quot;ubuntu-latest&quot;    steps:      - name: &quot;Checkout code&quot;        uses: &quot;actions/checkout@v3&quot;        with:          fetch-depth: 0      - name: &quot;Python Semantic Release&quot;        uses: &quot;python-semantic-release/python-semantic-release@master&quot;        with:          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}          repository_username: __token__          repository_password: ${{ secrets.PYPI_TOKEN }}```</longdescription>

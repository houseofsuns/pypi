	<longdescription>## Microsoft Azure SDK for PythonThis is the Microsoft Azure Mixed Reality Management Client Library.Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is the next generation of management APIsthat replace the old Azure Service Management (ASM).This package has been tested with Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7.For the older Azure Service Management (ASM) libraries, see[azure-servicemanagement-legacy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure-servicemanagement-legacy)library.For a more complete set of Azure libraries, see the[azure sdk python release](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/all).## UsageTo learn how to use this package, see the [quickstart guide](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt)For docs and references, see [Python SDK References](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/)Code samples for this package can be found at [Mixed Reality Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/browse/?languages=python&amp;term=Getting%20started%20-%20Managing&amp;terms=Getting%20started%20-%20Managing) on docs.microsoft.com.Additional code samples for different Azure services are available at [Samples Repo](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt/samples)## Provide FeedbackIf you encounter any bugs or have suggestions, please file an issue inthe [Issues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues)section of the project.![image](https://azure-sdk-impressions.azurewebsites.net/api/impressions/azure-sdk-for-python%2Fazure-mgmt-mixedreality%2FREADME.png)# Release History## 1.0.0 (2021-04-27)**Features**  - Model Operation has a new parameter properties  - Model Operation has a new parameter origin  - Model Operation has a new parameter is_data_action  - Model SpatialAnchorsAccount has a new parameter plan  - Model SpatialAnchorsAccount has a new parameter system_data  - Model SpatialAnchorsAccount has a new parameter sku  - Model SpatialAnchorsAccount has a new parameter identity  - Model SpatialAnchorsAccount has a new parameter storage_account_name  - Model SpatialAnchorsAccount has a new parameter kind  - Model RemoteRenderingAccount has a new parameter plan  - Model RemoteRenderingAccount has a new parameter system_data  - Model RemoteRenderingAccount has a new parameter sku  - Model RemoteRenderingAccount has a new parameter storage_account_name  - Model RemoteRenderingAccount has a new parameter kind  - Added operation group ObjectAnchorsAccountsOperations## 1.0.0b1 (2020-12-14)This is beta preview version.This version uses a next-generation code generator that introduces important breaking changes, but also important new features (like unified authentication and async programming).**General breaking changes**- Credential system has been completly revamped:  - `azure.common.credentials` or `msrestazure.azure_active_directory` instances are no longer supported, use the `azure-identity` classes instead: https://pypi.org/project/azure-identity/  - `credentials` parameter has been renamed `credential`- The `config` attribute no longer exists on a client, configuration should be passed as kwarg. Example: `MyClient(credential, subscription_id, enable_logging=True)`. For a complete set of  supported options, see the [parameters accept in init documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#available-policies)- You can't import a `version` module anymore, use `__version__` instead- Operations that used to return a `msrest.polling.LROPoller` now returns a `azure.core.polling.LROPoller` and are prefixed with `begin_`.- Exceptions tree have been simplified and most exceptions are now `azure.core.exceptions.HttpResponseError` (`CloudError` has been removed).- Most of the operation kwarg have changed. Some of the most noticeable:  - `raw` has been removed. Equivalent feature can be found using `cls`, a callback that will give access to internal HTTP response for advanced user  - For a complete set of  supported options, see the [parameters accept in Request documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#available-policies)**General new features**- Type annotations support using `typing`. SDKs are mypy ready.- This client has now stable and official support for async. Check the `aio` namespace of your package to find the async client.- This client now support natively tracing library like OpenCensus or OpenTelemetry. See this [tracing quickstart](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/core/azure-core-tracing-opentelemetry) for an overview.## 0.2.0 (2020-05-25)**Features**  - Added operation SpatialAnchorsAccountsOperations.list_keys  - Added operation SpatialAnchorsAccountsOperations.get  - Added operation SpatialAnchorsAccountsOperations.regenerate_keys  - Added operation SpatialAnchorsAccountsOperations.delete  - Added operation group MixedRealityClientOperationsMixin  - Added operation group RemoteRenderingAccountsOperations**Breaking changes**  - Operation SpatialAnchorsAccountsOperations.create has a new signature  - Operation SpatialAnchorsAccountsOperations.update has a new signature  - Removed operation SpatialAnchorsAccountsOperations.get_keys**General Breaking Changes**This version uses a next-generation code generator that *might*introduce breaking changes. In summary, some modules were incorrectlyvisible/importable and have been renamed. This fixed several issuescaused by usage of classes that were not supposed to be used in thefirst place.  - MixedRealityClient cannot be imported from    `azure.mgmt.mixedreality.mixed_reality_client` anymore (import from    `azure.mgmt.mixedreality` works like before)  - MixedRealityClientConfiguration import has been moved from    `azure.mgmt.mixedreality.mixedreality_client`     to `azure.mgmt.mixedreality`    - A model `MyClass` from a &quot;models&quot; sub-module cannot be imported    anymore using `azure.mgmt.mixedreality.models.my_class` (import from    `azure.mgmt.mixedreality.models` works like before)  - An operation class `MyClassOperations` from an `operations`    sub-module cannot be imported anymore using    `azure.mgmt.mixedreality.operations.my_class_operations` (import from    `azure.mgmt.mixedreality.operations` works like before)Last but not least, HTTP connection pooling is now enabled by default.You should always use a client as a context manager, or call close(), oruse no more than one client per process.## 0.1.0 (2019-02-05)  - Initial Release</longdescription>

	<longdescription># NetApp ONTAPThe Python client library is a package you can use when writing scripts to access theONTAP REST API. It provides support for several underlying services, including connectionmanagement, asynchronous request processing, and exception handling. By using the Pythonclient library, you can quickly develop robust code to support the automation of your ONTAPdeployments.# Getting startedThe Python client library is available as the package **netapp_ontap** at the Python PackageIndex (PyPi) web site at https://pypi.org/project/netapp-ontap## Software requirementsBefore installing the Python client library, you must make sure the following packages areinstalled on your system:  * python 3.5 or later    * requests 2.26.0 or later   ** Note: certifi, a dependency of the requests library has a CVE against it so we encourageyou to upgrade to the latest version (2022.12.07) on your system. You can findmore information about the CVE here: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23491.   * requests-toolbelt 0.9.1 or later* marshmallow 3.2.1 or later  The library requires version 1.26.7 or later of urllib3 due to outstanding CVEs againstolder versions. However, it will still work with older versions of urllib3 as long asthat version of urllib3 is compatible with the requests package.## Installing and importing the packageYou must install the package using the pip utility:```pip install netapp-ontap```After installing the package, you can import the objects you need into your application:```pythonfrom netapp_ontap.resources import Volume, Snapshot```## Creating an objectYou can create an object in several different ways. Here are three examples ofcreating an equivalent `Volume` object.```pythonfrom netapp_ontap.resources import Volume# Example 1 - keyword argumentsvolume = Volume(name='vol1', svm={'name': 'vs1'}, aggregates=[{'name': 'aggr1'}])# Example 2 - dict as keyword argumentsdata = {    'name': 'vol1',    'svm': {'name': 'vs1'},    'aggregates': [{'name': 'aggr1'}],}volume = Volume(**data)# Example 3 - using the from_dict() methodvolume = Volume.from_dict({    'name': 'vol1',    'svm': {'name': 'vs1'},    'aggregates': [{'name': 'aggr1'}],})```## Performing actions on an objectAfter you create an object, you can perform actions on the object basedon the purpose and design of your application. The example below illustrateshow to create a new volume and then take a snapshot.Note that when using the library, in all cases you must first establish aconnection to the management LIF of the ONTAP system using the`netapp_ontap.host_connection.HostConnection` object. In the example below,the connection is created and then set as the global default.This means that all objects and the associated actions reusethis same connection. See *Host connections* for more information.```pythonfrom netapp_ontap import config, HostConnectionfrom netapp_ontap.resources import Volume, Snapshotconfig.CONNECTION = HostConnection('myhost.mycompany.com', 'username', 'password')volume = Volume(name='vol1', svm={'name': 'vs1'}, aggregates=[{'name': 'aggr1'}])volume.post()snapshot = Snapshot.from_dict({    'name': '%s_snapshot' % volume.name,    'comment': 'A snapshot of %s' % volume.name,    'volume': volume.to_dict(),})snapshot.post()```# Host connectionsThe `netapp_ontap.host_connection.HostConnection` object allows a client applicationto store credentials once and reuse them for each subsequent operation.You can do this in any of the following ways:* Use the connection object as a context manager with the **with** keyword.* Call the function `set_connection()` on a specific resource so the connection is used forall actions on the resource.* Set the `netapp_ontap.config.CONNECTION` variable to establish a single connection instance for alloperations within the scope of that block. This allows you to connect to ONTAP onceand use the same connection everywhere, instead of providing credentials every time you make arequest.Note that you can call `get_connection()` to get the connection used by an object and use it forsubsequent operations.By default, every operation attempts to verify the SSL certificate for the connection. If acertificate cannot be verified, the **SSLError** exception is thrown. You can disable thisverification by setting `netapp_ontap.host_connection.HostConnection.verify` to false when creating the`netapp_ontap.host_connection.HostConnection` instance.## Custom headersIn some cases, you might want to set and send custom headers with the REST request.This can be done at the connection level. For a specific connection, you can pass inthe headers you would like to send for each request within the scope of that connection object.The library provides full access to the request headers so that you can update, add, or deleteheaders from the same connection object at any point. If a header is not recognized by ONTAP,it is ignored.```pythonfrom netapp_ontap import config, HostConnectionheaders = {'my-header1':'my-header-value1', 'my-header2':'my-header-value2'}# Initialize a connection object with custom headersconfig.CONNECTION = HostConnection('myhost.mycompany.com', 'username', 'password', headers=headers)# Delete a header from a connection objectconn = HostConnection('myhost.mycompany.com', 'username', 'password', headers=headers)del conn.request_headers['my-header1']# Add a header to a connection object using the assignment operatorconn = HostConnection('myhost.mycompany.com', 'username', 'password', headers=headers)conn.request_headers['mynew-header'] = 'mynew-header-value'# Add headers to a connection objectconfig.CONNECTION = HostConnection('myhost.mycompany.com', 'username' 'password')config.CONNECTION.request_headers = headers# Update an existing header using the assignment operatorconfig.CONNECTION = HostConnection('myhost.mycompany.com','username','password', headers=headers)config.CONNECTION.request_headers['my-header1'] = 'my-new-header'```# Asynchronous processing and jobsAll POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests that can take more than two seconds to complete aredesigned to run asynchronously as non-blocking operations. These operations are executedas background jobs at the ONTAP cluster. The HTTP response generated by anasynchronous request always contains a link to the associated job object. By default, anasynchronous request automatically polls the job using the unique job identifier in the link.Control is returned to your script when a terminal state is reached (success or failure) orthe configured timeout value expires. However, you can override this behavior by setting the**poll** value to false when calling the function, causing control to return before the jobcompletes. Forcing an immediate return can be useful when a job might take a long time tocomplete and you want to continute execution of the script.# ResponsesA request always returns a `netapp_ontap.response.NetAppResponse` object which contains the detailsof the HTTP response. It contains information such as whether the response is an erroror a job. Refer to `netapp_ontap.response.NetAppResponse` for further information on howto check the details of the response.# Exception handlingBy default, an exception is returned if a request returns an HTTP status code of 400 or greater.The exception object, which is of type `netapp_ontap.error.NetAppRestError`,holds the HTTP response object so that the exception can be handled in the client code.If you wish not to raise exceptions, you can set `netapp_ontap.config.RAISE_API_ERRORS` to false. In this case,it is up to the client to check the HTTP response from the `netapp_ontap.response.NetAppResponse`object and handle any errors. Refer to `netapp_ontap.error.NetAppRestError` for further information.```python# Set RAISE_API_ERRORS to False and check the HTTP response.config.RAISE_API_ERRORS = Falseresponse = Svm.find(name=&quot;nonexistent_vs&quot;)assert &quot;entry doesn't exist&quot; in response.http_response.text```# DebuggingWhile writing your application, it can often be useful to see the raw HTTP request and responsetext that the library is sending to and from the server. There are two flags that can be setto help with this.## DEBUG flagThe first is the DEBUG flag. This can be set either by setting DEBUG=1 in the environment priorto executing your application or by setting `netapp_ontap.utils.DEBUG` to 1 inside of your application.This flag, when set, will cause the library to log the request and response for any failedAPI call. This will be logged at DEBUG level (see the section on logging for setting up yourapplication). Here's an example of setting this value inside of your application:```pythonimport loggingfrom netapp_ontap import HostConnection, NetAppRestError, config, utilsfrom netapp_ontap.resources import Volumelogging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)config.CONNECTION = HostConnection('10.100.200.50', username='admin', password='password', verify=False)# Set the DEBUG flag to 1utils.DEBUG = 1# this API call will fail with a 404try:    volume = Volume(uuid=&quot;1&quot;, name='does_not_exist')    volume.get()except NetAppRestError:    print('We got an expected exception')```Here is what the output would look like:```$ python test_debug.pyDEBUG:urllib3.util.retry:Converted retries value: 5 -&gt; Retry(total=5, connect=None, read=None, redirect=None, status=None)DEBUG:urllib3.connectionpool:Starting new HTTPS connection (1): 10.100.200.50:443DEBUG:urllib3.connectionpool:https://10.100.200.50:443 &quot;GET /api/storage/volumes/1 HTTP/1.1&quot; 404 130DEBUG:netapp_ontap.utils:-----------REQUEST-----------GET https://10.100.200.50:443/api/storage/volumes/1Accept: */*User-Agent: python-requests/2.21.0Connection: keep-aliveAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflateX-Dot-Client-App: netapp-ontap-python-9.8.0Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46cGFzc3dvcmQKNone----------------------------------------RESPONSE-----------404 Not FoundDate:Tue, 12 Nov 2019 13:00:24 GMTServer:libzapid-httpdX-Content-Type-Options: nosniffCache-Control: no-cache,no-store,must-revalidateContent-Length: 130Content-Type: application/hal+jsonKeep-Alive: timeout=5, max=100Connection:Keep-Alive{  &quot;error&quot;: {    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;&quot;1&quot; is an invalid value for field &quot;uuid&quot; (&lt;UUID&gt;)&quot;,    &quot;code&quot;: &quot;2&quot;,    &quot;target&quot;: &quot;uuid&quot;  }}------------------------------We got an expected exception$```## LOG_ALL_API_CALLS flagThere is also a LOG_ALL_API_CALLS flag which can be set in the same ways. You canset it in the environment or during script execution by setting `netapp_ontap.utils.LOG_ALL_API_CALLS`to 1. This flag will produce the same output as above, but it will log the call nomatter if there was a failure or not. Here's an example of what that would looklike if we got an existing volume:```pythonimport loggingfrom netapp_ontap import HostConnection, config, utilsfrom netapp_ontap.resources import Volumelogging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)config.CONNECTION = HostConnection('10.100.200.50', username='admin', password='password', verify=False)# Set the LOG_ALL_API_CALLS flag to 1utils.LOG_ALL_API_CALLS = 1# this API call will succeed and be loggedvolume = list(Volume.get_collection())[0]```Here is what the output would look like:```$ python test_debug.pyDEBUG:urllib3.util.retry:Converted retries value: 5 -&gt; Retry(total=5, connect=None, read=None, redirect=None, status=None)DEBUG:urllib3.connectionpool:Starting new HTTPS connection (1): 10.100.200.50:443DEBUG:urllib3.connectionpool:https://10.100.200.50:443 &quot;GET /api/storage/volumes HTTP/1.1&quot; 200 567DEBUG:netapp_ontap.utils:-----------REQUEST-----------GET https://10.100.200.50:443/api/storage/volumesUser-Agent: python-requests/2.21.0Connection: keep-aliveAccept: */*Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflateX-Dot-Client-App: netapp-ontap-python-9.8.0Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46cGFzc3dvcmQKNone----------------------------------------RESPONSE-----------200 OKDate:Tue, 12 Nov 2019 13:14:01 GMTServer:libzapid-httpdX-Content-Type-Options: nosniffCache-Control: no-cache,no-store,must-revalidateContent-Length: 567Content-Type: application/hal+jsonKeep-Alive: timeout=5, max=100Connection:Keep-Alive{  &quot;records&quot;: [    {      &quot;uuid&quot;: &quot;c68bdca8-d090-11e9-bb29-005056bb7f42&quot;,      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;vs0_root&quot;,      &quot;_links&quot;: {        &quot;self&quot;: {          &quot;href&quot;: &quot;/api/storage/volumes/c68bdca8-d090-11e9-bb29-005056bb7f42&quot;        }      }    },    {      &quot;uuid&quot;: &quot;ed3b6ebf-d48e-11e9-bb29-005056bb7f42&quot;,      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;vs1_root&quot;,      &quot;_links&quot;: {        &quot;self&quot;: {          &quot;href&quot;: &quot;/api/storage/volumes/ed3b6ebf-d48e-11e9-bb29-005056bb7f42&quot;        }      }    }  ],  &quot;num_records&quot;: 2,  &quot;_links&quot;: {    &quot;self&quot;: {      &quot;href&quot;: &quot;/api/storage/volumes&quot;    }  }}------------------------------$```# Additional considerationsIn most cases, the objects and actions in the library can be mapped directlyto equivalent cURL commands run against the ONTAP REST interface. However, there are a fewexceptions you should be aware of.## Property namesIf a property of a resource is named the same as one of the Python reserved names,the name is transposed when accessing the member of the resource. For example,if there is a resource named &quot;Foo&quot; that has a property defined in the API named &quot;class&quot;,the property name would instead be &quot;class_&quot; when using the library. For example:```pythonfrom netapp_ontap.resources import Foofoo = Foo()foo.class_ = &quot;high&quot;```## Action methodsSome resources may have additional methods aside from the generic get(), post(),patch(), etc. These are known as &quot;action methods&quot; and will send requests to anendpoint matching the same name. For example, the `netapp_ontap.resources.security_certificate.SecurityCertificate`resource has the `netapp_ontap.resources.security_certificate.SecurityCertificate.sign()` method.Using this method will make a POST call to /api/security/certificates/{uuid}/sign.If a resource has a field with the same name as an action method, then the name ofthe action method will be changed so as to not conflict. In the above example, ifthe SecurityCertificate object had a field called `sign`, then the name of the actionmethod would be `sign_action()` instead.# DocumentationTo view the latest documentation, visit https://devnet.netapp.com/restapi.php , click on the&quot;Python Client Library&quot; tab, and then choose the latest version of the docs. You can also viewthe ONTAP REST API docs linked from the same page under the &quot;Overview&quot; tab.If you want to view this library's docs offline, then you can locate the copy installed in`&lt;python_environment&gt;/lib/&lt;python_version&gt;/site_packages/netapp_ontap/docs`.# CompatibilityThe version assigned to the library consists of the major ONTAP release it is generatedfrom and a minor version for the library within that release. For example: within theONTAP 9.7 product family, the library may ship several fix releases by incrementing theminor index: 9.7.0, 9.7.1, 9.7.2. The minor versionallows the library to be updated at a cadence separate from ONTAP.Client libraries that have the same major version as ONTAP are completely compatible.For example, the libraries netapp-ontap-9.6.1 and netapp-ontap-9.6.4 are fullycompatible with both ONTAP 9.6 and ONTAP 9.6P1.A client library will support N-1 major versions of ONTAP with full backwards compatiblityof all APIs and fields. For example, a program written using client library 9.6.1 andtalking to ONTAP 9.6 will continue to function consistently when the client library isupdated to 9.7.0.A client library with a major version less than the ONTAP release can still beused, however it will not be able to access any of the new REST APIs. For example, the librarynetapp-ontap-9.6.4 is only partially compatible with ONTAP 9.7. In this case, the library willnot have access to the newer APIs or fields offered by ONTAP, but scripts can continue toaccess any of the same 9.6 fields they were before without issue.For example a new property **volume.is_svm_root** was added with ONTAP 9.7.The following behaviors would be seen with different libraries and ONTAP combinations:* library 9.6.0 would ignore the value coming from an ONTAP 9.7 response* library 9.7.0 would fully support the property coming from an ONTAP 9.7+ response* library 9.7.0 would not produce any errors for that property coming from an ONTAP 9.6 response# ChangelogThere are several changes to the Python Client Library and the ONTAP REST API, which are organized by release below.## 9.12.1 library updates** New endpoints *** Endpoint: /application/consistency-groups/{consistency_group.uuid}/snapshots/{uuid}    HTTP methods: PATCH    This API completes a Snapshot copy operation of a consistency group.  * Endpoint: /security/aws-kms    HTTP methods: GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE    These APIs allow ONTAP to securely store its encryption keys using AWS KMS.

`count_collection()` method is now available on all resources which have a `get_collection()`. This method is a shortcut for getting only the number of items matching a query. For example: `Volume.count_collection(name=&quot;backup_vol*&quot;)` is roughly equivalent to `len(list(Volume.get_collection(name=&quot;backup_vol*&quot;)))`.* The application can now add its own custom headers for each request as part of the `netapp_ontap.host_connection.HostConnection` object.* When passing verify=False to the HostConnection, the library will now disable urllib3's InsecureRequestWarning from logging messages.**Fixed issues*** [Bug ID 1322090](https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/bugs-online/product/ONTAP/BURT/1322090)    When polling jobs, the certificate verification setting was hard-coded to False, so it would behave the same regardless of how the user set it.* [Bug ID 1322095](https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/bugs-online/product/ONTAP/BURT/1322095)   The get_collection() call using the connection parameter was not correctly setting the connection on the returned resource objects.* [Bug ID 1279507](ihttps://mysupport.netapp.com/site/bugs-online/product/ONTAP/BURT/1279507)    When doing a find() with the fields query parameter, the library was not returning the specified fields, instead, all fields were being returned.* [Bug ID 1291333](https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/bugs-online/product/ONTAP/BURT/1291333)    When 0 records are found in a Resource.find() call and LOG_ALL_API_CALLS is set to True, then an uncaught exception is raised.* [Bug ID 1271450](https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/bugs-online/product/ONTAP/BURT/1271450)    The library doesn't allow sending a body in a DELETE request.* [Bug ID 1263312](https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/bugs-online/product/ONTAP/BURT/1263312)    When POSTing or PATCHing some objects with embedded objects, fields might incorrectly be dropped from the request.* [Bug ID 1275238](https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/bugs-online/product/ONTAP/BURT/1275238)    Retrieving and setting the &quot;from&quot; field of Autosupport object fails.**Incompatibilities*** In prior versions, Resource.find() would raise an exception if no results were found as well as when more than one was found. In this version, when no results are found, None is returned instead of raising an exception. An exception is still raised when more than one result is found.##ONTAP 9.7 REST API updatesAll new ONTAP APIs have corresponding library resource objects which can be usedto perform the operations. See the `netapp_ontap.resources` package for detailsabout each of the objects and their fields.For a summary of the changes in the ONTAP REST API between versions of ONTAP 9, see the [ONTAP 9 Release

	<longdescription>DataDiff========DataDiff is a library to provide human-readable diffs of python data structures.It can handle sequence types (lists, tuples, etc), sets, and dictionaries.Dictionaries and sequences will be diffed recursively, when applicable.It has special-case handling for multi-line strings, showing them as a typical unified diff.Drop-in replacements for some nose assertions are available.  If the assertion fails,a nice data diff is shown, letting you easily pinpoint the root difference.``datadiff`` works on Python 2.6 through Python 3.DataDiff project homepage: http://sourceforge.net/projects/datadiff/Example-------Here's an example::    &gt;&gt;&gt; from datadiff import diff    &gt;&gt;&gt; a = dict(foo=1, bar=2, baz=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11])    &gt;&gt;&gt; b = dict(foo=1, bar=4, baz=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])    &gt;&gt;&gt; print diff(a, b)    --- a    +++ b    {    -'bar': 2,    +'bar': 4,     'baz': [     @@ -5,11 +5,8 @@      6,      7,      8,     -9,     -10,     -11,     ],     'foo': 1,    }    &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; from datadiff.tools import assert_equal    &gt;&gt;&gt; assert_equal([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 5])    Traceback (most recent call last):      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;      File &quot;datadiff/tools.py&quot;, line 29, in assert_equal        raise AssertionError(msg)    AssertionError:    --- a    +++ b    [    @@ -0,2 +0,2 @@     1,     2,    -3,    +5,    ]License-------Copyright Dave BrondsemaLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the &quot;License&quot;);you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.You may obtain a copy of the License at  http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, softwaredistributed under the License is distributed on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.See the License for the specific language governing permissions andlimitations under the License.</longdescription>

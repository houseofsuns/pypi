	<longdescription># pygridgainGridGain Community Edition thin (binary protocol) client, written in Python 3.## Prerequisites- Python 3.7 or above (3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10 are tested),- Access to GridGain node, local or remote. The current thin client  version was tested on GridGain CE 8.7 and 8.8 (binary client protocol 1.7.1).## Installation### From repositoryThis is a recommended way for users. If you only want to use the `pygridgain`module in your project, do:```$ pip install pygridgain```### From sourcesThis way is more suitable for developers or if you install client from zip archive.1. Download and/or unzip GridGain Python client sources to `gridgain_client_path`2. Go to `gridgain_client_path` folder3. Execute `pip install -e .````bash$ cd &lt;gridgain_client_path&gt;$ pip install -e .```This will install the repository version of `pygridgain` into your environmentin so-called “develop” or “editable” mode. You may read more about[editable installs](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs)in the `pip` manual.Then run through the contents of `requirements` folder to installthe additional requirements into your working Python environment using```$ pip install -r requirements/&lt;your task&gt;.txt```You may also want to consult the `setuptools` manual about using `setup.py`.### *optional C extension*There is an optional C extension to speedup some computational intensive tasks. If it's compilation fails(missing compiler or CPython headers), `pygridgain` will be installed without this module.- On Linux or MacOS X only C compiler is required (`gcc` or `clang`). It compiles during standard setup process.- For building universal `wheels` (binary packages) for Linux, just invoke script `./scripts/create_distr.sh`.     ***NB!* Docker is required.**  - On Windows MSVC 14.x required, and it should be in path, also python versions 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10 both for x86 and  x86-64 should be installed. You can disable some of these versions but you'd need to edit script for that.- For building `wheels` for Windows, invoke script `.\scripts\BuildWheels.ps1` using PowerShell. Just make sure that  your execution policy allows execution of scripts in your environment.    Ready wheels for `x86` and `x86-64` for different python versions (3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10) will be  located in `distr` directory.### Updating from older versionTo upgrade an existing package, use the following command:```pip install --upgrade pygridgain```To install the latest version of a package:```pip install pygridgain```To install a specific version:```pip install pygridgain==1.4.0```## Documentation[The package documentation](https://pygridgain.readthedocs.io) is availableat *RTD* for your convenience.If you want to build the documentation from source, do the developerinstallation as described above, then run the following commands:```$ pip install -r requirements/docs.txt$ cd docs$ make html```Then open `&lt;client_root_directory&gt;/docs/generated/html/index.html`in your browser.## ExamplesSome examples of using pygridgain are provided in`examples` folder. They are extensively commented in the“[Examples of usage](https://pygridgain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html)”section of the documentation.This code implies that it is run in the environment with `pygridgain` packageinstalled, and GridGain node is running on localhost:10800.## Testing*NB!* It is recommended installing `pygridgain` in development mode.Refer to [this section](#from-sources) for instructions.Do not forget to install test requirements: ```bash$ pip install -r requirements/install.txt -r requirements/tests.txt```Also, you'll need to have a binary release of Ignite with `log4j2` enabled and to set`IGNITE_HOME` environment variable: ```bash$ cd &lt;gridgain_binary_release&gt;$ export IGNITE_HOME=$(pwd)$ cp -r $IGNITE_HOME/libs/optional/ignite-log4j2 $IGNITE_HOME/libs/```### Run basic tests```bash$ pytest```### Run with examples```bash$ pytest --examples ```If you need to change the connection parameters, see the documentation on[testing](https://pygridgain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html#testing).</longdescription>

GOFit was developed with scientific curve fitting problems in mind but is also applicable to general curve fitting problems provided they can be formulated as nonlinear least-squares problems.Full details on how to use GOFit are available in the [documentation](https://ralna.github.io/GOFit/).Requirements------------GOFit provides pre-built [Python wheels](https://realpython.com/python-wheels/) for most common platforms with all dependencies included. However if a wheel does not exist for your platform (or if building from source), GOFit requires the following software to be installed:* PyBind11 2.9.1 or above (&lt;https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/&gt;)* Eigen 3.4 or above (&lt;https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/&gt;)* CMake 3.18 or above (&lt;https://cmake.org/&gt;)Installing GOFit----------------For easy installation, use [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/):```bash$ pip install gofit```Note that if an older install of GOFit is present on your system you can use:```bash$ pip install --upgrade gofit```to upgrade GOFit to the latest version.Installing GOFit from source----------------------------Alternatively, you can download the source code from [Github](https://github.com/ralna/gofit) and unpack as follows:```bash$ git clone https://github.com/ralna/gofit$ cd gofit```GOFit can then be compiled and installed using:```bash$ pip install .```**Please Note:** *don't forget to install the required dependencies (see above).*To upgrade GOFit to the latest version, navigate to the top-level directory (i.e. the one containing `setup.py`) and re-run the installation using `pip`, as above:```bash$ git pull$ pip install .```Testing-------The [documentation](https://ralna.github.io/GOFit/) provides some simple examples of how to run GOFit.Uninstallation--------------You can uninstall GOFit as follows:```bash$ pip uninstall gofit```Bugs----Please report any bugs using GitHub's issue tracker.License-------This software is released under the New BSD license.</longdescription>

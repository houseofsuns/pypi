	<longdescription>Module MrFixGeneral information The MrFix module is designed to create UI autotests written in Python using the Selenium library. Description of the methods of the MrFix moduleMrFix is a module with a set of decorators methods for writing UI-autotests in Python + Selenium. It contains all the basic methods needed to write UI-autotests. It is an open source product. It is distributed on the terms of free software (i.e. it allows you to legally use it, including on commercial projects). Supports the principle of &quot;all in one and in one place&quot;. Allows a beginner (and not a beginner either) autotester not to search for a solution through various manuals and websites, but to immediately find it and use proven working methods in the MrFix module.Also the advantage of the module is:    • reducing the amount of code when using methods of  module;        • a great concentration of the autotester on the correct implementation of the autotest logic, and not on the technical part of autotest;        • the uniformity of the approach of all methods to the form of organization of input data, which simplifies the memorization and application of methods of module    Link of source code:https://github.com/MrFix-Autotesting-Framework/MrFix-Autotesting-FrameworkDescription of methodsMethod Description: check_exists_xpath(driver, check_xpath)This method is a static method used to check for the presence of an element with a specified XPath expression on a web page. It takes two parameters: driver and check_xpath. The driver parameter represents the WebDriver instance being used for automation, while the check_xpath parameter is the XPath expression used to locate the desired element on the page.The method temporarily sets a shorter implicit wait timeout to 1 second using driver.implicitly_wait(1) in order to expedite the element search. It then attempts to find the element using the provided XPath expression.If the element is found, indicating its presence on the page, the method returns True to indicate its existence.However, if the element is not found, the method catches a NoSuchElementException and returns False to indicate that the element is not present on the page at the moment. This can occur if the XPath is incorrect or if the element is not currently visible or available.After either finding the element or encountering the NoSuchElementException, the method restores the original implicit wait timeout using driver.implicitly_wait(original_timeout) to revert to the previous wait setting. This ensures that subsequent operations or searches are not affected by the shorter timeout used within this method.It is important to note that this method assumes the usage of the Selenium WebDriver library for browser automation. Prior to calling this method, you should have a valid WebDriver instance (driver) and provide the correct XPath expression (check_xpath) to locate the desired element on the page.Please make sure to import the necessary dependencies and set up the WebDriver appropriately before using this method.Method Description: click_element_by_xpath(driver, element_xpath)This method is a static method used to perform a click action on an element identified by a specified XPath expression on a web page. It takes two parameters: driver and element_xpath. The driver parameter represents the WebDriver instance being used for automation, while the element_xpath parameter is the XPath expression used to locate the desired element on the page.The method attempts to find the element using the provided XPath expression using driver.find_element(By.XPATH, element_xpath). If the element is found, it performs a click action on the element using element.click().If the click action is performed successfully, the method returns True to indicate the successful click.However, if the element is not found, the method catches a NoSuchElementException and returns an error message indicating that the element was not found. This can occur if the XPath is incorrect or if the element is not present on the page.In addition to handling the NoSuchElementException, the method also catches any other exceptions that may occur during the process. If an unexpected error occurs, the method captures the error message and returns it as an error message string.It is important to note that this method assumes the usage of the Selenium WebDriver library for browser automation. Prior to calling this method, you should have a valid WebDriver instance (driver) and provide the correct XPath expression (element_xpath) to locate the desired element on the page.Please make sure to import the necessary dependencies and set up the WebDriver appropriately before using this method.Method Description: select_from_dropdown_text(driver, dropdown_xpath, dropdown_text)This method is a static method used to select an option from a dropdown list based on its text.

If the URL exists and the page loads successfully, no exception is raised.If no exception is raised, the method returns True, indicating that the URL exists and is accessible.However, if a WebDriverException is caught, it implies that the URL either does not exist or failed to load within the specified timeout period. In such cases, the method returns False to indicate that the URL does not exist or is inaccessible.It's important to note that this method assumes the usage of the Selenium WebDriver library for browser automation. Prior to calling this method, you should have a valid WebDriver instance (driver).Please make sure to import the necessary dependencies and set up the WebDriver appropriately before using this method. Additionally, the method requires the WebDriverException class to be imported from the Selenium WebDriver library.Method Description: open_url_in_new_tab(driver, open_url)This static method is used to open a URL in a new tab using the provided WebDriver instance. It takes two parameters: driver and open_url. The driver parameter represents the WebDriver instance being used for automation, while open_url represents the URL to be opened.The method follows the following steps to open the URL in a new tab:    1. It first sends the keyboard combination Ctrl + t to the &lt;body&gt; element of the current page to open a new tab. This is achieved using the send_keys(Keys.CONTROL + 't') method call on driver.find_element_by_tag_name('body').    2. After opening the new tab, the method switches the WebDriver's focus to the newly opened tab using driver.switch_to.window(driver.window_handles[-1]). This ensures that subsequent actions are performed on the new tab.    3. The method then opens the specified URL in the new tab by calling driver.get(open_url). The WebDriver will navigate to the provided URL in the new tab.    4. If the URL is opened successfully without any WebDriver exceptions being raised, the method returns True to indicate that the URL was opened in the new tab successfully.    5. However, if a WebDriverException is caught during the execution, it implies that there was an error in opening the URL in the new tab. In such cases, the method returns the error message as a string representation of the exception (str(e)) to provide information about the specific error that occurred.Please note that this method assumes the usage of the Selenium WebDriver library for browser automation. Prior to calling this method, you should have a valid WebDriver instance (driver).Additionally, make sure to import the necessary dependencies and set up the WebDriver appropriately before using this method.Method Description: check_element_is_displayed(driver, element_xpath)    This static method is used to check if an element specified by its XPath is displayed on the page. It takes two parameters: driver and element_xpath. The driver parameter represents the WebDriver instance being used for automation, while element_xpath represents the XPath of the element to be checked.The method follows the following steps to check if the element is displayed:    1. It attempts to locate the element on the page using the find_element() method of the WebDriver instance. The element is identified by its XPath, which is passed as the element_xpath parameter.    2. If the element is found, the method proceeds to check if it is displayed by calling the is_displayed() method on the element object. The is_displayed() method returns True if the element is visible on the page, and False otherwise.    3. If the element is displayed (i.e., is_displayed() returns True), the method returns True to indicate that the element is indeed displayed on the page.    4. If the element is not found on the page, a NoSuchElementException is raised. In this case, the method returns the error message as a string representation of the exception (str(e)), providing information about the specific error that occurred.    5. If any other exception occurs during the execution of the method, it is caught by the except Exception as e block. The method returns the error message as a string representation of the exception (str(e)), providing information about the specific error that occurred.Please note that this method assumes the usage of the Selenium WebDriver library for browser automation. Prior to calling this method, you should have a valid WebDriver instance (driver).Additionally, make sure to import the necessary dependencies and set up the WebDriver appropriately before using this method.Method Description: get_clipboard_text()    This static method is used to retrieve the text content from the clipboard.

It calls the pyperclip.paste() function, which retrieves the text content from the clipboard.    2. The retrieved text is then converted to a string using the str() function.    3. The method returns the clipboard text as a string.Please note that this method relies on the pyperclip library, so make sure to have it installed before using this method. Additionally, the availability and behavior of clipboard operations may vary across different operating systems and environments.Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the clipboard and that the clipboard contains text content before calling this method.Method Description: convert_string_to_float(string_for_convert)    This static method is used to convert a string to a floating-point number. It takes a single parameter string_for_convert, which is the string that needs to be converted.The method follows the following steps to convert the string to a float:    1. It attempts to convert the input string to a float by using the float() function. However, before performing the conversion, it replaces any commas (,) in the string with periods (.) to ensure compatibility with decimal notation.    2. If the conversion is successful and the resulting float value is not an empty string, the method continues to the next step. Otherwise, it returns an error message indicating a ValueError.    3. The method further processes the float value by removing any spaces within the string. It replaces all occurrences of spaces with an empty string using the replace() method, with a limit of 100 replacements. This is done to handle cases where the string contains extraneous spaces that might interfere with the conversion.    4. Finally, the method converts the processed float value to a floating-point number using the float() function.    5. The resulting float value is returned.If an error occurs during the conversion process, such as when the input string cannot be converted to a float, a ValueError exception is caught. In such cases, the method returns the error message as a string.Ensure that the input string represents a valid numerical value before calling this method to avoid conversion errors.Method Description: check_text_is_present_on_page(driver, check_text)    This static method is used to check if a specific text is present on a web page.

It takes two parameters: driver represents the web driver instance, and waiting_time is the maximum time to wait for the alert to appear.The method executes the following steps to handle the alert:    1. It waits for the alert to appear using the provided waiting_time by creating a WebDriverWait object and calling the until() method with EC.alert_is_present() condition.    2. Once the alert is present, the method switches the driver's focus to the alert using Alert(driver) and accepts it by calling the accept() method. This action clicks the &quot;OK&quot; button on the alert.    3. If the &quot;OK&quot; button is clicked successfully, the method returns True to indicate the successful execution.    4. If no alert window is present within the specified waiting time, the method returns the string &quot;No alert window present&quot;.    5. If any exceptions occur during the process, the method catches the exception and returns an error message containing the exception details.Make sure to initialize the driver instance and navigate to a web page before calling this method. Adjust the waiting_time parameter as needed to accommodate the time it takes for the alert to appear.</longdescription>

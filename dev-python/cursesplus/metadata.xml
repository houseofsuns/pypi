	<longdescription># Curses PlusExtension library to curses## How To InstallUse ```pip3 install cursesplus```on Linux or ```py -m pip install cursesplus```on Windows### SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR WINDOWSFor Windows you need to also install ```windows-curses``` or related programto provide the basic curses functionality## What's New?### THE SWITCH TO 3.0cursesplus is getting a widgets based system. The old utilities have been moved to a classic class. filedialogues and message boxes remain. The program will likely be hard to use until everything is finalized.**DANGER: THIS IS A TRULY BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE UPDATE. LOTS OF CODE WILL NEED TO BE REFACTORED!**### 3.3 - Add Window.add_raw_text that uses the addstr method - Add Window title - Default text is &quot;WINDOW&quot;# Documentation## Two Ways to Use### 1. New WayThe new way is currently under construction, so expect some bugs. The New Way does not need any fooling around with bare curses. The new way is an abstration of curses, almost a &quot;replacement&quot; if you will. To start, do something like this. Only one function is required:```import cursespluswin = cursesplus.show_ui()#See below for how to use classic utilities in a 3.x environment```### 2. The Old WayIf you have been using cursesplus since before 3.0, you know what to do. You need to manually call initscr or wrapper and pass the stdscr to each function individually. For example```import cursesplusimport cursesdef main(stdscr):    cursesplus.classic.displaymsg(stdscr,[&quot;This is a message&quot;])curses.wrapper(main)```### 1A. Using classic utilities in a new set-upTo use Old-Style utility functions in a new way, see this code. This does the same as the example in part 2```import cursespluswin = cursesplus.show_ui()cursesplus.classic.displaymsg(win.screen,[&quot;This is a message&quot;])cursesplus.shutdown_ui() #Good practice to close down after```## transitions.pytransitions contains many transitions to add animations to your program### _old(stdscr,func_to_call=None,args=(),type=0)This is the old transitions function found in cursesplus prior to like 2.8 or something. It has since been replaced by horizontal_bars() and random_blocks()- `stdscr` is a curses window object- `func_to_call` is a function. If it is set to none, no function is called- `args` is a tuple. The tuple will be passed to the function as arguments- `type` is an int. It may be 0 or 1. If it is 0, there are horizontal bars. If it is 1, it is random blocks### __exec(func,args)**NOTE: THIS IS AN INTERNAL FUNCTION, IT IS NOT MEANT TO BE USED BY THE COMMON USER**This executes `func(args)`### horizontal_bars(stdscr,func_to_call=None,args=(),speed=1)This is a replacement function to old's type zero. It fills the screen from the top down with horizontal white bars. It then replaces them with black bars in the same configuration.- `stdscr` is a curses window object- `func_to_call` is a function. If it is set to none, no function is called- `args` is a tuple. The tuple will be passed to the function as arguments- `speed` is an int. A higher value increases the animation speed. A lower value (0 - 1) makes it slower. If you set speed to 0, the program will crash.### random_blocks(stdscr,func_to_call=None,args=(),speed=1)This is a replacement for old's type one transition. It fills random characters of the screen with blocks until the whole screen is covered, then it removes it in the same fashion.- `stdscr` is a curses window object- `func_to_call` is a function. If it is set to none, no function is called- `args` is a tuple. The tuple will be passed to the function as arguments- `speed` is an int. A higher value increases the animation speed. A lower value (0 - 1) makes it slower. If you set speed to 0, the program will crash.### vertical_bars(stdscr,func_to_call=None,args=(),speed=1)This is an all new transition. It functions like horizontal bars except they are vertical and go left to right.- `stdscr` is a curses window object- `func_to_call` is a function. If it is set to none, no function is called- `args` is a tuple. The tuple will be passed to the function as arguments- `speed` is an int. A higher value increases the animation speed. A lower value (0 - 1) makes it slower. If you set speed to 0, the program will crash.</longdescription>

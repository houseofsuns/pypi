	<longdescription># Durin control systemThis repository contains Python code that interfaces with the robot Durin, built by the [Neurocomputing Systems group](https://neurocomputing.systems) at the [KTH Royal Instititute of Technology](https://kth.se).Please note that this is only the reference implementation for our interface. See below.## InstallationWe require a working Python installation with access to [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).After that, installation is straight-forward:```bashpip install durin```## UsageThe interface is meant to be used via Python. More examples can be found in the [`durin/examples`](https://github.com/ncskth/durin/tree/main/durin/examples) folder.```pythonfrom durin import *# The ip address to Durin is 172.16.223.9X, where X is the number of the robot (1, 2, or 5).durin_ip = &quot;172.16.223.91&quot;# This connects to durin and displays a user interface (UI)with DurinUI(durin_ip) as durin:    while True:        # Get observation        (obs, dvs, cmd) = durin.read()        # Do clever things...        # Move durin 100 units left with 0 forward/backward motion and 0 rotation        command = Move(100, 0, 0)        # Send a command to Durin        durin(command)        # ... this loop continues forever!        # You can exit it on your computer by pressing CTRL+C```## Sensory dataThe `durin.read()` method will give you access to 1. An `Observation` from the robot sensors object containing    * `.tof` Time of Flight sensors    * `.charge` Battery charge2. A 640x480 DVS [PyTorch](pytorch.org) tensor    * This tensor has buffered/stacked events since the last `.read()` command.    * Note that this is **only** available if the Durin has a DVS sensor installed3. Replies from the robot, following any `Poll` commands    * This is specified in the protocol datasheet below - feel free to ignore## CommandsThe most important command is `Move(x, y, rotation)`. the `x`, `y`, `rotation` values should be in the interval between [-500, 500].## Custom implementationYou can interface to the microcontroller (sensor + wheel actuation) and DVS microcamera with TCP and UDP.A complete specification is available via Google Drive: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11jD30J00-03ygZ6zJaVTnjJRQKfczT-wMIdBdpYMxD4/edit?usp=sharingEach robot has two IP addresses - one for the microcontroller and one for the DVS controller.The robots are numbered 1, 2, or 5. Insert those numbers where `X` is written below:* `172.16.223.9X`: Microcontroller for sensory data and motor commands* `172.16.223.10x`: Raspberry Pi for streaming DVS data## ContactReach out to Juan or Jens if you need anything.</longdescription>

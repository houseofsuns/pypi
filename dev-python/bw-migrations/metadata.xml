Often, a simple mapping is suitable, and tools like [correspondentia](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/correspondentia) are a good fit. However, sometimes one needs more complexity, e.g. change field X to Y, but only if field A has value B. When ecoinvent released version 3, they changed their unit of mesaure for water from kilograms to cubic meters. ``bw_migrations`` provides tools for this more complicated transformations, and is built around the following data format:    {        # The fields on which to filter        'fields': ['name', 'category', 'unit'],        'data': [            (                # First element is input data in the order of `fields` above                ('Water', 'air', 'kilogram'),                # Second element is new values to substitute when all fields match                {                    'unit': 'cubic meter',                    '__multiplier__': 0.001                }            )        ]    }And is implemented with the following pseudo-code:    for element in input_data:        for original, new in migration['data']:            if all(element[field] == original[field] for field in migration['fields']):                element.update(dict(zip(migration['fields'], new)))The actual code is a bit more complex, as `bw_migrations` can also do rescaling of probability distributions and disaggregation migrations (splitting one object into several outputs).</longdescription>

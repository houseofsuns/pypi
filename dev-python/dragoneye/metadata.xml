It is intended to function as component in other tools who have the need to collect data quickly (multi-threaded), or as a command line to collect a snapshot of a cloud account.dragoneye currently supports AWS (AssumeRole and AccessKey based collection) and Azure (with client secret).# SetupClone this git repository, navigate to the root directory where `setup.py` is located and run:```pip install .```(note the period at the end of the command)We recommend doing this within a virtual environment, like so:```python3.9 -m venv ./venv. ./venv/bin/activatepip install .```# Usage## Programmatic UsageCreate an instance of one of the CollectRequest classes, such as AwsAccessKeyCollectRequest, AwsAssumeRoleCollectRequest, AzureCollectRequest and call the `collect` function. For example:```pythonfrom dragoneye import AwsScanner, AwsCloudScanSettings, AwsSessionFactory, AzureScanner, AzureCloudScanSettings, AzureAuthorizer, GcpCloudScanSettings, GcpCredentialsFactory, GcpScanner### AWS ###aws_settings = AwsCloudScanSettings(    commands_path='/Users/dev/python/dragoneye/aws_commands_example.yaml',    account_name='default', default_region='us-east-1', regions_filter=['us-east-1'])#### Using environment variablessession = AwsSessionFactory.get_session(profile_name=None, region='us-east-1')  # Raises exception if authentication is unsuccessfulaws_scan_output_directory = AwsScanner(session, aws_settings).scan()#### Using an AWS Profilesession = AwsSessionFactory.get_session(profile_name='MyProfile', region='us-east-1')  # Raises exception if authentication is unsuccessfulaws_scan_output_directory = AwsScanner(session, aws_settings).scan()#### Assume Rolesession = AwsSessionFactory.get_session_using_assume_role(external_id='...',                                                          role_arn=&quot;...&quot;,                                                          region='us-east-1')aws_scan_output_directory = AwsScanner(session, aws_settings).scan()### Azure ###azure_settings = AzureCloudScanSettings(    commands_path='/Users/dev/python/dragoneye/azure_commands_example.yaml',    subscription_id='...',    account_name='my-account')#### Using a registered application in Azure ADtoken = AzureAuthorizer.get_authorization_token(    tenant_id='...',    client_id='...',    client_secret='...')  # Raises exception if authentication is unsuccessfulazure_scan_output_directory = AzureScanner(token, azure_settings).scan()### GCP ###gcp_settings = GcpCloudScanSettings(commands_path='/Users/dev/python/dragoneye/gcp_commands_example.yaml',                                    account_name='gcp', project_id='project-id')# Authenticating by GCP default auth mechanism:#    Checks environment in order of precedence:#    - Environment variable GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS pointing to#      a file with stored credentials information.#    - Stored &quot;well known&quot; file associated with `gcloud` command line tool.#    - Google App Engine (production and testing)#    - Google Compute Engine production environment.default_credentials = GcpCredentialsFactory.get_default_credentials()# Using a file that contains the service account credentials service_account_file_credentials = GcpCredentialsFactory.from_service_account_file('filepath.json')# Using a dictionary that contains the service account credentials (the content of the file from above example)service_account_dict_credentials = GcpCredentialsFactory.from_service_account_info({'...': '...'})# Using impersonation method (service_account_A allowing service_account_B to generate short-lived credentials of service_account_A)impersonation_credentials = GcpCredentialsFactory.impersonate(default_credentials, 'client_email@google.com', ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute.readonly'])# Authenticating from an AWS resource via a credentials config file defined by the 'Workload Identity Federation'wif_credentials = GcpCredentialsFactory.from_aws_credentials_config_file('filepath.json')# Same as above, but with the content of the above filewif_credentials = GcpCredentialsFactory.from_aws_credentials_config_info({'...': '...'})gcp_scan_output_directory = GcpScanner(default_credentials, gcp_settings)```## CLI usage### For collecting data from AWSDragoneye will use the same mechanisms boto3 uses for authentication. It will generally look for AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, etc. as environment variables.```dragoneye aws```### For collecting data from AzureYou can authenticate in one of two ways:1. `az login`, which will allow dragoneye to use credentials loaded through Azure CLI.2. With client id and secret of an application registered in your Azure AD.```dragoneye azure```### For collecting data from GPYou can authenticate in several ways:1. `gcloud auth application-default login`, which will allow dragoneye to use credentials loaded through GCP CLI.2. With service account credentials - either a file, or its content.3. With impersonation mechanism; service_account_A allowing service_account_B to generate short-lived credentials of service_account_A4. With Workload Identity Federation mechanism, authenticating from AWS.```dragoneye gcp```</longdescription>

	<longdescription># PyPPMS## PUMAPI - Python Interface[Stratocore][3]'s *PPMS* booking system offers an API (the so-called *PUMAPI*, short forPPMS Utility Management API) for fetching information from the booking system as well aschanging its state and properties.This is a Python 3 package for talking to the *PUMAPI*.## Usage ExampleFetch email addresses of all active users:```Pythonfrom pyppms import ppmsfrom credentials_ppms import PPMS_URL, PPMS_API_KEYconn = ppms.PpmsConnection(PPMS_URL, PPMS_API_KEY)print(&quot;Querying PPMS for emails of active users, can take minutes...&quot;)emails = ppms.get_users_emails(active=True)print(f&quot;Got {len(emails)} email addresses from PPMS:&quot;)print(&quot;\n&quot;.join(emails))```## TestingAutomated testing is described in the [`TESTING` document on github][2].## NoteThe PPMS API sometimes exposes a bit of a surprising behavior. Duringdevelopment of the package, we came across several issues (this list iscertainly incomplete):* HTTP status return code is always `200`, even on failed authentication.* Results of queries are a mixture of CSV (with headers) and and text with  newlines (with no headers and therefore without structural information on  the data). JSON is implemented in some cases only.* The CSV headers sometimes do contain spaces between the colons, sometimes  they don't.* Some fields are quoted in the CSV output, some are not. Difficult to separate  the values since there are colons in the values too.* Semantics of keys is not consistent. Sometimes `user` is the user id,  sometimes it refers to the user's full name.* Using an invalid permission level (e.g. `Z`) with the `setright` action is  silently ignored by PUMAPI, the response is still `done` even though this  doesn't make any sense.* There is no (obvious) robust way to derive the user id from the user's full  name that is returned e.g. by `getrunningsheet`, making it very hard to  cross-reference it with data from `getuser`.* The result of the `getrunningsheet` query in general is not suited very well  for automated processing, it seems to be rather tailored for humans and  subject to (mis-) interpretation.* Unfortunately `Username` and `Systemname` are not the unique id, they are  rather the full description. Therefore sometimes looping over all users and  systems is necessary.* Some results have a very strange format - for example, the starting time of  the next booking is given as *minutes from now* instead of an absolute time.* Official documentation is rather rudimentary, i.e. it contains almost no  information on what is returned in case wrong / invalid parameters are  supplied and similar situations.## References* [Imagopole PPMS Java client][1][1]: https://github.com/imagopole/ppms-http-client/blob/master/src/main/java/org/imagopole/ppms/api/PumapiRequest.java[2]: https://github.com/imcf/pyppms/blob/master/TESTING.md[3]: https://www.stratocore.com/</longdescription>

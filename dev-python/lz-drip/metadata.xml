	<longdescription># `lz_drip` Project #The `lz_drip` project contains plug-ins for the `drip_feed` command that is part of the `drip_drip` package.The `drip_feed` command can either take the name of the plug-in as it argument, or the name can be specified in the `DRIP_DROPPER` environmental variable.It should be noted that any `INI` file and section discussed below can be declared either as `drip_drip` options (`-i` and `-s` respectively) or as environmental variables (`DRIP_INI_FILE` and `DRIP_INI_SECTION` respectively.)## `lz_drip:SpadeReception` plug-in ##The `lz_drip:SpadeReception` plug-in is used to `drip_feed` SPADE bundles from a receiving dropbox, i.e. one to which a remote SPADE copies its files, to a &quot;shadow&quot; receiving dropbox, i.e. one from which the localSPADE reads the files. Using this plug-in avoids the shadow dropbox from becoming too full, under which circumstances the local SPADE's performance can be severely degraded.The configuration for this plugin is defined within section of the `INI` file provided with the command. This section should contain the following:* source: The location of the receiving dropbox;* destination: The location of the &quot;shadow&quot; receiving dropbox; and* threshold: The maximum number of bundles allowed in the &quot;shadow&quot; receiving dropbox.Here is an example `INI` file.    [usdc.surf.raw.in]    source = /global/cfs/cdirs/lz/spade/receiving/surf    destination = /global/cfs/cdirs/lz/spade/receiving/surf.shadow    threshold = 100These values can also be set by environmental variables, in which chase the variable supersedes any value in the `INI` file.* `FILE_DRIP_SOURCE`* `FILE_DRIP_DESTINATION`* `FILE_DRIP_THRESHOLD`## `salt_arrival` ##</longdescription>

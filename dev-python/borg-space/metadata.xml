	<longdescription>Borg-Space — Report and track the size of your Emborg repositories==================================================================.. image:: https://pepy.tech/badge/borg-space/month    :target: https://pepy.tech/project/borg-space.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/borg-space.svg    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/borg-space.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/borg-space.svg    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/borg-space/:Author: Ken Kundert:Version: 2.2:Released: 2023-06-12*Borg-Space* is an accessory for Emborg_.  It reports on the space consumed by your *BorgBackup* repositories.  You can get this information using the``emborg info`` command, but there are several reasons to prefer *Borg-Space*.#. *Borg-Space* is capable of reporting on many repositories at once.#. The *Emborg* *info* command gives a great deal of information,   whereas *Borg-Space* only reports the space consumed by the repository,   so is much more compact.#. The report is user customizable.#. *Borg-Space* can record the size of your repositories each time it is run   so you can track the space requirements over time.#. Finally, *Borg-Space* can graph the recorded values.To show the size of one or more repositories, simply run::    # borg-space home    home: 12.81 GBYou can specify any number of repositories, and they can be composites.  In the following example, *home* is an alias that expands to *borgbase* and *rsync*::    &gt; borg-space home cache    borgbase: 2.44 GB    cache: 801 MB    rsync: 2.81 GBYou can specify repositories that are owned by others or that are on remote machines.  In this case you will need permission to read the *Emborg* data directory for the repository. Specifically, ❬host❭:~❬user❭/.local/share/emborg/❬config❭.latest.nt must be accessible.❬config❭ is the name of the *Emborg* configuration to be reported on, ❬host❭ is the name of the host on which the *Emborg create* command was run, and ❬user❭ is the name of the user that ran the command.To specify these repositories, a special naming scheme is used::    ❬config❭@❬host❭~❬user❭This is referred to as the full repository specification, or repository spec.  Both ``@❬host❭`` and ``~❬user❭`` are optional, ❬host❭ is not needed when referring to the local host and ❬user❭ is not needed when referring to the current user.  Thus the *Emborg* configuration named *primary* owned by *root* on the host with the SSH name *neptune* is accessed with::    # borg-space primary@neptune~root    primary@neptune~root: 57.74 GBUsage-----*Borg-Space* supports the following command line arguments::    Usage:        borg-space [--quiet] [--style &lt;style&gt;] [--record] [&lt;spec&gt;...]        borg-space [--graph] [--svg &lt;file&gt;] [--log-y] [--record] [&lt;spec&gt;...]    Options:        -r, --record                 save the result        -q, --quiet                  do not output the size message        -s &lt;style&gt;, --style &lt;style&gt;  the report style                                     choose from compact, table, tree, nt, json        -g, --graph                  graph the previously recorded sizes over time        -l, --log-y                  use a logarithmic Y-axis when graphing        -S &lt;file&gt;, --svg &lt;file&gt;      produce plot as SVG file rather than display itRepository specs take the form ``❬name❭`` or ``❬config❭[@❬host❭][~❬user❭]``.  Items in brackets are optional and ❬name❭ is the name given for a repository therepositories setting.The available styles are *compact*, *table*, *tree*, *nt* or *nestedtext*, or *json*.  If you specify something other than the these, what you give is taken to be a *compact format* specification.Results are saved to ~/.local/share/borg-space/&lt;full_spec&gt;.nt.Settings are held in ~/.config/borg-space/settings.nt.Settings--------You can create a NestedText_ settings file to specify default behaviors and define composite repositories.  For example::    default repository: home    report style: tree    compact format: {name}: {size:{fmt}}.  Last back up: {last_create:ddd, MMM DD}.  Last squeeze: {last_squeeze:ddd, MMM DD}.    table format: {host:&lt;8} {user:&lt;5} {config:&lt;9} {size:&lt;8.2b} {last_create:ddd, MMM DD}    table header: HOST     USER  CONFIG    SIZE     LAST BACK UP    report fields: size last_create last_squeeze    tree report fields: size    date format: D MMMM YYYY    size format: .b    repositories:        # define some convenient aliases        root: root~root        dev: root@dev~root        mail: root@mail~root        files: root@files~root        bastion: root@bastion~root        media: root@media~root        web: root@web~root        cluster: home@cluster        # define useful combinations        home:            children: rsync borgbase cluster        servers:            children:                - dev                - mail                - files                - bastion                - media                - web        all:            children: home servers rootdefault repository:    The name of the repository to be used if none are given on the command line.report style:    The report style to be used if none is specified on the command line.      Choose from *compact*, *table*, *tree*, *nestedtext* or *nt*, or *json*.compact format:    The format to be used for the line when the requested report style is     *compact*.  The *name*, *spec*, *full_spec*, *config*, *host*, *user*,     *size*, *fmt*, *last_create*, *last_prune*, *last_compact* and     *last_squeeze*  fields are replaced by the corresponding values.  *name* is     the name given the repository in the *repositories* setting.  *spec* is the     specification given as specified, and *full_spec* is the full specification     (any pieces missing from *spec* are filled in).  If a name is not available,     *name* becomes the same as *spec*.  *last_squeeze* is simply the later of     *last_prune* and *last_compact*.  *size* is a QuantiPhy_ *Quantity* and the     *last_* fields are all Arrow_ objects (see the example in the next section     for examples on how to specify formatting on *QuantiPhy* and *Arrow*     objects).  The remaining field values are strings.    The default is::        {name}: {size:{fmt}}table format:    The format to be used for the line when the requested report style is     *table*.  The *name*, *spec*, *host*, *user*, *config*, *size*, *fmt*,     *last_create*, *last_prune*, *last_compact* and *last_squeeze*  fields will     be replaced by the corresponding values.  *last_squeeze* is simply the later     of *last_prune* and *last_compact*.  *size* is a QuantiPhy_ *Quantity* and     the *last_* fields are all Arrow_ objects.  The remaining field values are     strings.    The default is::        {host:8} {user:8} {config:8} {size:&lt;8.2b}  {last_create:ddd, MMM DD}table header:    The header to be printed just before the table report.  It is used to give     column headers.  Leave empty to suppress the header.    The default is::        HOST     USER     CONFIG   SIZE      LAST BACK UPreport fields:    The fields to include in *tree*, *nestedtext* and *json* style reports by     default.  Default is *size*, *last_create*, and *last_squeeze*.tree report fields:    The fields to include in *tree* style reports.  If not given it defaults to     the value of *report fields*.nestedtext report fields:    The fields to include in *nestedtext* style reports.  If not given it     defaults to the value of *report fields*.json report fields:    The fields to include in *json* style reports.  If not given it defaults to     all available size and date fields.size format:    The format to be used when giving the size of the repository.  This is     a QuantiPhy_ format string.  In the example, ``.2b`` means that a binary     format with two extra digits is used (one digit is required. so ``.2b``     prints with three digits of precision.  If not given, it defaults to     ``.2b``.date format:    The Arrow_ format to be used for the date when the requested report style is     *tree* or *nestedtext*.  If not given, it defaults to ``D MMMM YYYY``.repositories:    Defines repository aliases and composite repositories.  Given as     a collection of name:value pairs.  The value may contain zero or more     repository specifications.  The specifications may be a strings or     dictionaries.  The following forms are accepted::        repositiories:            home:                # home becomes an alias for home on localhost for current user        repositiories:            home: home-primary                # home becomes an alias for home-primary on localhost for current user        repositiories:            home: home@host~user                # home becomes an alias for home@host~user        repositiories:            home:                # home becomes an alias for home@host~user                config: home                host: host                user: user        repositiories:            all: home@host~user work@host~user                # all contains home@host~user and work@host~user        repositiories:            all:                # all contains home@host~user and work@host~user                - home@host~user                - work@host~user        repositiories:            all:                # all contains home@host~user and work@host~user                -                    config: home                    host: host                    user: user                -                    config: work                    host: host                    user: user        repositiories:            home: home@host~user                # home becomes an alias for home@host~user            work: work@host~user                # work becomes an alias for work@host~user            all: home work                # all contains home and workGraphing--------To graph the size of a repository over time you must first routinely record its size.  You can record the sizes with::    &gt; borg-space -r homeThe sizes are added to the file ``~/.local/share/borg-space/❬full_spec❭.nt``.Typically you do not manually run *Borg-Space* to record the sizes of yourrepositories.  Instead, you can record sizes automatically in two differentways.  In the first, you simply use crontab to automatically record the sizes atfixed times::    00 12 * * *  borg-space -q -r homeIn this case the command runs at noon every day and uses the ``-q`` option tosuppress the output to stdout.  This approach can be problematic if *Emborg*needs access to SSH or GPG keys to run.The other approach is to add *Borg-Space* to the *run_after_backup* setting inyour *Emborg* configs.  That way it is run every time you run backup::    run_after_backup = [        'borg-space -r {config_name}'    ]Once you have recorded some values, you can graph them using::    &gt; borg-space -g homeThis displays the graph on the screen. Alternately, you can save the graph to a file in SVG format using::    &gt; borg-space -S home.svg homeI routinely monitor the repositories for over a dozen hosts, and to make it convenient I create a composite *Emborg* configuration containing all the hosts, and then use the ``--log-y`` option so that I can easily see all the results scaled nicely on the same graph::    &gt; borg-space -l allInstallation------------*Borg-Space* requires *Emborg* version 1.37 or newer.Install with::    &gt; pip3 install borg-space.. _emborg: https://emborg.readthedocs.io.. _nestedtext: https://nestedtext.org.. _arrow: https://arrow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide.html#supported-tokens.. _quantiphy: https://quantiphy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#quantiphy.Quantity.format</longdescription>

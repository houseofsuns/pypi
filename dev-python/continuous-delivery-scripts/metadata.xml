For production quality releases the version will look as follows:- `&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;`Beta releases are used to give early access to new functionality, for testing and to get feedback on experimental features. As such these releases may not be stable and should not be used for production. Additionally any interfacesintroduced in a beta release may be removed or changed without notice. For **beta** releases the version will look asfollows:- `&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;-beta.&lt;pre-release-number&gt;`## InstallationIt is recommended that a virtual environment such as [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/blob/master/README.md) isused for all installations to avoid Python dependency conflicts.To install the most recent production quality release use:```pip install continuous-delivery-scripts```To install a specific release:```pip install continuous-delivery-scripts==&lt;version&gt;```## Usage &amp; DocumentationCode documentation is available for the most recentproduction release here:- [GitHub Pages](https://armmbed.github.io/continuous-delivery-scripts)The package follows the [**Unix tools philosophy**](https://tldp.org/LDP/GNU-Linux-Tools-Summary/html/c1089.htm):&gt; The tools philosophy was to have small programs to accomplish a particular task instead of trying to develop large monolithic programs to do a large number of tasks. To accomplish more complex tasks, tools would simply be connected together, using pipes.Therefore, it installs the following tools which can be used anywhere within a project/repository comprising a pyproject.toml file such as the [one defining this project](./pyproject.toml):* `cd-assert-news`: Asserts that the PR/Branch contains a news file describing the changes introduced* `cd-determine-version`: Returns the version of the tool* `cd-generate-news`: Generates a changelog file based on the news files present in the repository* `cd-get-config`: Returns project configuration values* `cd-tag-and-release`: Releases the project (Language specific actions are run, See [plugins](./continuous_delivery_scripts/plugins))* `cd-create-news-file`: Generates a news file* `cd-generate-docs`: Generates project Code documentation which can then be rendered by GitHub pages (See [docs folder](./docs))* `cd-generate-spdx`: Generates SPDX documents for the project (3rd party IP reporting/ OpenChain)* `cd-license-files`: Updates the Licence header and copyright to all the source code files## Project StructureThe follow described the major aspects of the project structure:- `.github` - CI and GitHub configuration files.- `docs/` - Interface definition and usage documentation.- `examples/` - Usage examples.- `continuous-delivery-scripts/` - Python source files.- `news/` - Collection of news files for unreleased changes.- `tests/` - Unit and integration tests.## Getting Help- For interface definition and usage documentation, please see [GitHub Pages](https://armmbed.github.io/continuous-delivery-scripts).- For a list of known issues and possible workarounds, please see [Known Issues](./KNOWN_ISSUES.md).- To raise a defect or enhancement please use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ARMmbed/continuous-delivery-scripts/issues).## Contributing- We are committed to fostering a welcoming community, please see our  [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for more information.- For ways to contribute to the project, please see the [Contributions Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md)- For a technical introduction into developing this package, please see the [Development Guide](./DEVELOPMENT.md)</longdescription>

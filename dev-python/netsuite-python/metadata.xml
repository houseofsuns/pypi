Enable Services        * Restlets        * Rest Web Services        * OAUTH 2.0    2. Create a role for the integration with the following permissions:        * Access Token Management        * Log in using Access Tokens        * Log in using OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens        * OAuth 2.0 Authorized Applications Management        * REST Web Services        * SuiteApp Deployment        * SuiteScript        * User Access Tokens    3. Create an integration record         * Check Client Credentials ( MAchine to Machine Grant)        * Under Scope Select             * Restlets            * Rest Web Services        * STORE THE CLIENT ID     4. Create and upload the certificate        * with dev environment setup, run ```netsuite generate-certificate```        * upload the public cert to Netsuite under Setup -&gt; Integrations -&gt; Manage Oauth 2.0## Setup The Easy Way  ##run ``` netsuite initialize ```* Follow the prompts* Docs will be located in the generated &quot;netsuite_rest_client folder&quot; at the rot of the project#### Usage ####```python# import Netsuite Packagefrom netsuite import Netsuite# import the generated Clientfrom netsuite_rest_client import apis, rest_api_client# import modelsfrom netsuite_rest_client.model.customer import Customer# instantiate the SDKnetsuite = Netsuite()# Instantiate the generated Clientrest_client = rest_api_client.RestApiClient(netsuite)# Instantiate the generated API endpoints using the generated clientcustomer_api = apis.CustomerApi(rest_client)```#### Notes ####  * Requirements    * Sandbox requires the same setup as Prod, it DOES NOT copy over    * An administrator for the Netsuite app to follow the steps [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_157771281570.html)      * A user with the correct role      * A role with the correct permissions      * An Integration Record with the correct permissions (ensure default form is set correctly)        * Client ID and Secret comes from this step, ensure they provide these      * Certificate ID        * A Certificate can be generated once you register the package with CLI with 'netsuite generate-certificate'         * Cert ID is available under Setup -&gt; Integration -&gt; OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials once the certificate is uploaded.## Use Restlets ##saved search example ref: https://timdietrich.me/blog/netsuite-saved-search-api/```python# import restlet clientrestlet_client = netsuite.RESTLET_CLIENT.restlet_api# create body params body_params = {&quot;searchID&quot;: 'customsearch184275'}# call restletprint(restlet_client.execute_restlet(script=1999, deploy=1, body_params=body))```## Regenerating the API Client with more records typesre-run ```netsuite generate-rest-client```* when asked about using more record types, choose option that lets you set them* pick record types from the list* complete prompts## Uploading x509 certificate to Netsuite ##* On Client's Netsuite top ribbon go to `Setup -&gt; Integration -&gt; OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials`* Click `Create-New` button    * Entity: The User created for TAG    * ROLE: Role created for this integration    * Application: Application Created for this integration    * Certificate: Click &quot;Choose A File&quot; and upload the PUBLIC Cert (called netsuite-certificate.pem by default)* Copy the Certificate ID# Other Commands ### Generating x509 certificate for Netsuite ### * Run `netsuite generate-certificate`   * Domain: theapiguys.com   * Organization: TAG    * Department: DEV   * City: BOSTON   * State: MA   * Country: US   * Email: will@theapiguys.com  * It will store the cert in a file in the root of the project under config/netsuite## Setting up Netsuite SDK in a project ##* Run `netsuite generate-client-config`    * It will ask you for information obtained above: You can use all the defaults        * Client ID        * Netsuite Certificate ID        * Netsuite Key File        * Netsuite Application Name         * Storage Class          * If you want to save to file        * Provide a valid path for netsuite-credentials.json        * else the credentials will be echoed out    * To confirm, check the netsuite credentials path you entered, or the default, and there should be a json file with all      the info you entered. Verify the details.## Getting The Access Token ##* Run `$netsuite get-access-token`    * Use the defaults or repeat the info used above for        * Path to Netsuite Credentials    * Confirm the app name to be refreshed, if single app, just use default* That's it! You should now have a valid token to use with the Netsuite API.</longdescription>

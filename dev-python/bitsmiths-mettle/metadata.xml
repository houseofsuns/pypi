	<longdescription># Mettle #Bitsmiths-Mettle is the supporting code generators and python libraries for the Mettle project.See our &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitbucket.org/bitsmiths_za/mettle.git&quot;&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt; and main *README* for more details!## Requirements ##Python 3.10+## Installation ##```console$ pip install bitsmiths-mettle---&gt; 100%```## Change History ##### 2.2.9 ###| Type   | Description || ------ | ----------- || Fix | Fixed an exception priority issue with the `mettle-psycopg` driver where reset connections were being caught by the lock exception. |### 2.2.8 ###| Type   | Description || ------ | ----------- || New | The `mettle-sql-build` entry point in the python package now accepts wild card inputs.  |### 2.2.7 ###| Type   | Description || ------ | ----------- || Fix | Python database table generetor respects not null columns that are integers and floats properly for pydantic and dataclass generation. |### 2.2.6 ###| Type   | Description || ------ | ----------- || Fix | The python encoded.databases[postgresql] driver was not handling null floats. Bug squashed. |### 2.2.5 ###| Type   | Description || ------ | ----------- || Fix | Changed PostgreSQL package dependency from `postgres` to `postgresql`. || Fix | The python braze serializers now use `isinstance` instead of `type` when checking value types. |### 2.2.4 ###| Type   | Description || ------ | ----------- || Fix | Improved package dependencies, thank-you Bradley Kirton. || New | Added a new optional `global-settings.file-header` setting to projects. Allows customization or removal or the generated header in all generated files. |### 2.2.3 ###| Type   | Description || ------ | ----------- || New | Implemented auto (reset) to database connections on failure for all python database drivers. (This excludes `asynpg` because it uses a pool that does it for us). || Bug | Fixed a python async code generation issue, where some `methods` and `with` statements were not using await or async.   |### 2.2.2 ###| Type   | Description || ------ | ----------- || Fix | Fixed an import issue with the Braze TCP overload in python. |### 2.2.1 ###| Type   | Description || ------ | ----------- || Fix | Applied `couplet` identifier improvement to braze couplets on python. |### 2.2.0 ###| Type   | Description || ------ | ----------- || New    | Added a `database_name()` method to all db connections. || New    | Select one statements that fail, will now raise the new `DBNotFound` error code. || New    | Added `psycopg3` database extension for `python3`. || New    | Added `psycopg3 async` database extension for `python3`. || New    | Python generation for `__slots__` added, requires python 3.10 and up. || New    | Added a `must_exist` optional parameter to the python generated `fetch()` methods which will raise an error if the fetch fails. || Breaking | In the python generated `fetch_all()` methods, renamed `clearList` to `clear_list`. || Breaking | Improved the genartion of `couplet` identifier names. This may cause some couplets to be generated with differnt names. || Bug    | Foreign key, and unique key violations now proplerly thrown for all the python db drivers. |### 2.1.14 ###| Type   | Description || ------ | ----------- || New    | Added a new python generator option `fetch.method`. Options are `c++` which is the legacy option and `python` which adds a fetch iterator method and creates a new object for each fetch instead of reusing the existing `orec`. || New    | Removed the `__del__` dunder from the python DAO code generation as it is not needed. |### 2.1.13 ###| Type   | Description || ------ | ----------- || New    | Angular makefile generators can now be dynamically extended with a different CC, and TARGS as well as have optional overwrite commands. || Bug    | Fixed configuration bug from the 2.1.12 where a null dataclass would cause a generation error. |### 2.1.12 ###| Type   | Description || ------ | ----------- || New    | Python database and braze models can now be generated with (pydantic, or dataclass, or attrs) as an option. || New    | Python database and braze models can now toggle (pk, serializer, dav, clear) features an and off. |### 2.1.11 ###| Type   | Description || ----   | ----------- || Bug    | Fixed a refactor of `errCode` to `err_code` that was not rippled through some of the base library code/ |### 2.1.10 ###| Type   | Description || ----   | ----------- || Change | General typing improvements, and minor bug fixes. |## License ##This project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.</longdescription>

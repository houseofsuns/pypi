	<longdescription># wadsTools for packaging and publishing to pypi for those who just don't want to deal with itTo install (for example):```pip install wads```# Usage ExamplesWe're going to assume you pointed &quot;pack&quot; to &quot;wads/pack.py&quot; and &quot;populate&quot; to &quot;wads/populate.py&quot;,because it's convenient for us to do so. You can achieve this in various ways(for example, putting the contents:`python /Users/Thor.Whalen/Dropbox/dev/p3/proj/i/wads/wads/pack.py &quot;$@&quot;`in a file named &quot;pack&quot; contained in your OS's script path.)## populateWhen? When you got a new project and you want to quickly set it up with the packaging goodies.Basic usage:```populate PKG_DIR```or, assuming you're using the terminal and you're in the `PKG_DIR` root folder of the project, you can just do:```populate .```What that will do is create and populate some files for you.Namely, it will ensure your package directory has the following files (if not present already)```./LICENSE./setup.cfg./PKG_NAME/__init__.py./README.md```The `PKG_NAME` will be taken to be the same as the name of the `PKG_DIR`.That will work, it will be minimal and will choose defaults for you.You can overwrite many of these, of course.For example,```populate -r https:///github.com/i2mint --description &quot;Something about my project...&quot;```Here are the following options:```positional arguments:  pkg-dir               -optional arguments:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  --description DESCRIPTION                        &quot;There is a bit of an air of mystery around this project...&quot;  -r ROOT_URL, --root-url ROOT_URL                        -  -a AUTHOR, --author AUTHOR                        -  -l LICENSE, --license LICENSE                        'mit'  --description-file DESCRIPTION_FILE                        'README.md'  -k KEYWORDS, --keywords KEYWORDS                        -  --install-requires INSTALL_REQUIRES                        -  --include-pip-install-instruction-in-readme                        True  -v, --verbose         True  -o OVERWRITE, --overwrite OVERWRITE                        ()  --defaults-from DEFAULTS_FROM                        -```Note that by default, populate will not overwrite files that all already there.It will edit the `setup.cfg` file if it's present (and missing some entries).## Configuring the defaults of `populate`Note that `defaults-from` option in the `populate` help.That's probably the most convenient argument of all.Go check out a file named `wads_confgis.json` in the root directory of the project.(If you don't know how to find that file, try this command:`python -c &quot;import wads; print(wads)&quot;` to get a clue).That `wads_confgis.json` file contains key-value entries that are used in the wads package.The `&quot;populate_dflts&quot;` key is used by the populate script.If you edit that, you'll get different defaults out of the box.But you can also add your own key-value pairs if you work on different kinds of projects that needdifferent kinds of defaults.For your convenience we added a `&quot;custom_dflts_example_you_should_change&quot;` key to illustrate this.## packThe typical sequence of the methodical and paranoid could be something like this:```python pack.py current-configs  # see what you gotpython pack.py increment-configs-version  # update (increment the version and write that in setup.cfgpython pack.py current-configs-version  # see that it workedpython pack.py current-configs  # ... if you really want to see the whole configs again (you're really paranoid)python pack.py run-setup  # see that it workedpython pack.py twine-upload-dist  # publish# and then go check things work...```If you're are great boilerplate hater you could just do:```pack go PKG_DIR```(or `pack go --version 0.0.0 PKG_DIR` if it's the very first release).But we suggest you get familiar with what the steps are doing, so you can bend them to your liking.</longdescription>

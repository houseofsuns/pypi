	<longdescription>The Project can be explained as follows:- Provide the chart details in an xml file.- Provide the path to your xml in your settings.py.- Make API calls to fetch the chart data as supported by Google Charts generated directly from your database. Or, you can just use our- Javascript library to get the chart directly using an angular directive &lt;hi-dash&gt; without making any API calls manually.- Use our APIs to generate reports of the charts in excel or pdf format.- UI Ready Dashboard- Group reports in the xml file and see all the charts in a single page by just hitting a single url and writting zero lines of code.</longdescription>

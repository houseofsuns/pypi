	<longdescription># `xeno`: The Python dependency injector from outer space. [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lainproliant/xeno.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lainproliant/xeno)`xeno` at its core is a simple Python dependency injection framework. Use it whenyou need to manage complex inter-object dependencies in a clean way. For themerits of dependency injection and IOC, seehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection.`xeno` should feel pretty familiar to users of Google Guice in Java, as itis somewhat similar, although it is less focused on type names and moreon named resources and parameter injection.`xeno` also offers `xeno.build`, a build automation framework built atop the coredependency injection inspired by [Invoke](https://www.pyinvoke.org/).  It isintended to come with batteries-included tools for making C/C++ projects,executing shell scripts, batching, and more.  It is built on the concept ofcomposable &quot;recipes&quot;, which are generic instructions for building differenttypes of filesystem targets.# InstallationInstallation is simple. With python3-pip, do the following:```$ sudo pip install -e .```Or, to install the latest version available on PyPI:```$ sudo pip install xeno```# Usage## As a build automation frameworkTo use `xeno.build` to build a simple C software project, first create a filecalled `build.py` in your repo (it can be called anything, but this iscustomary).  Follow this template example for guidance:```#!/usr/bin/env python3from xeno.build import *# TODO: Add recipes, providers, and tasks here.build()```Then, you can import the `compile` recipe from `xeno.recipes.c`:```from xeno.recipes.c import compile, ENV````ENV` here is the default environment variables that `compile` will use bydefault.  It defaults to using `clang` to compile C projects, you can changethat here, and you can add additional compile-time flags.  The `ENV` object isof type `xeno.shell.Environment`, which allows for some complex shlex-basedjoining and recombining of flags, such that you can additively compose theenviornment with defaults and/or what may be specified outside the build script.You can also provide your own environment variables via the `env=` parameter to`compile`.```ENV['CC'] = 'gcc'ENV += dict(    LDFLAGS='-g')```Let's create a provider that lists all of our source files and another thatlists our headers.  This will be useful for defining our tasks and using the`compile` recipe.```from pathlib import Path@providedef source_files():    return Path.cwd().glob(&quot;src/*.c&quot;)@providedef header_files():    return Path.cwd().glob(&quot;include/*.h&quot;)```Next, let's define a single default task that builds our program.```@task(default=True)def executable(source_files, header_files):    return compile(source_files, target=&quot;my_program&quot;, headers=header_files)````compile` can take iterables of source files and/or combinations of strings andlists in `*args`.  In this case, we elected to specify a target name for theprogram.  If this wasn't the case, the name of the resulting target would bebased on the name of the first source file.  This is ideal if there is only onesource being provided or if the main source file is always provided first and isthe desired name of the executable, but in this case it would be whatever camefirst in the directory order which isn't deterministic or ideal.Specifying the `headers=` parameter here links the recipe to our header filesas static file dependencies.  If these files change, the recipe is acknowledgedto be `outdated`, and will be rebuilt the next time the build script is run evenif an executable target already exists.That's it!  Let's put it all together, and then we'll have a build script forour program.```#!/usr/bin/env python3from xeno.build import *from xeno.recipes.c import compile, ENVfrom pathlib import PathENV['CC'] = 'gcc'ENV += dict(    LDFLAGS='-g')@providedef source_files():    return Path.cwd().glob(&quot;src/*.c&quot;)@providedef header_files():    return Path.cwd().glob(&quot;include/*.h&quot;)build()```Mark this script as executable and run it as `./build.py`, or use `pythonbuild.py`.  Be sure to check out `./build.py --help` for a list of command lineoptions and running modes.  `xeno.build` is smart and can create addressabletargets from a variety of different nested recipe construction scenarios, sobuild more complex scripts and try out `./build.py -L` to see them all!Watch this space for more in-depth documentation to come in the near future.## As an IOC frameworkTo use `xeno` as a dependency injection framework, you need to create axeno.Injector and provide it with modules. These modules are regularPython objects with methods marked with the `@xeno.provider`annotation. This annotation tells the `Injector` that this methodprovides a named resource, the same name as the method marked with`@provider`. These methods should either take no parameters (otherthan `self`), or take named parameters which refer to other resourcesby name, i.e. the providers can also be injected with other resources inorder to build a dependency chain.Once you have an `Injector` full of resources, you can use it toinject instances, functions, or methods with resources.To create a new object instance by injecting resources into itsconstructor, use `Injector.create(clazz)`, where `clazz` is theclass which you would like to instantiate. The constructor of this classis called, and all named parameters in the constructor are treated asresource references. Once the object is instantiated, any methods markedwith `@inject` are invoked with named resources provided.Resources can be injected into normal functions, bound methods, orexisting object instances via `Injector.inject(obj)`. If the parameteris an object instance, it is scanned for methods marked with `@inject`and these methods are invoked with named resources provided.### ExampleIn this simple example, we inject an output stream into an object.```import sysfrom xeno import *class OutputStreamModule:   @provide   def output_stream(self):      return sys.stdoutclass VersionWriter:   def __init__(self, output_stream):      self.output_stream = output_stream   def write_version(self):      print('The python version is %s' % sys.version_info,            file=self.output_stream)injector = Injector(OutputStreamModule())writer = injector.create(VersionWriter)writer.write_version()```Checkout `test.py` in the git repo for more usage examples.## Change Log### Version 7.1.0: Sep 09 2023- Add a `update()` override to `xeno.shell.Environment` which takes  the same arguments as `select()` but updates the dictionary in-place  instead of making and returning a new one.### Version 7.0.0: Sep 09 2023- Lift various build recipes from different projects into a  &quot;batteries-included&quot; set of build tools under `xeno.recipes.**`.- New enriched focus on backwards compatibility between minor versons.- Restructuring and refactoring, `xeno.cookbook` is deprecated.- From now on, legacy features will be marked as deprecated and made to  continue to work until the next major version, during which they  will be removed.### Version 4.12.0: Aug 07 2022- Changes to support Python 3.10, older versions are now deprecated.### Version 4.10.0: Oct 28 2021- Allow recipes to be specified with glob-style wildcards, as per `fnmatch`.### Version 4.9.0: Jan 03 2021- Deprecate `@recipe` factory decorator for `@factory`.- Allow recipes to specify a `setup` recipe, which is not part  of the recipe inputs or outputs but is needed to fulfill the task.### Version 4.8.0: Dec 29 2020- All recipe resources are loaded before targets are determined.- Recipe names are now valid targets for a build.### Version 4.7.0: Dec 16 2020- Fixed a bug where build would continue resolving with outdated results.- Added `@recipe` decorator to `xeno.build` to denote recipe functions.### Version 4.4.0: Nov 2 2020- Added experimental `xeno.build` module, a declarative build system driven by IOC.- Added `xeno.color` offering basic ANSI color and terminal control.### Version 4.3.0: May 9 2020- Allow methods to be decorated with `@injector.provide`, eliminating the need for modules  in some simple usage scenarios.### Version 4.2.0: May 8 2020- Split `Injector` into `AsyncInjector` and `SyncInjector` to allow injection to be performed  in context of another event loop if async providers are not used.- Fixed `AsyncInjector` to actually support asynchronous resolution of dependencies.### Version 4.1.0: Feb 3 2020- Added `Injector.get_ordered_dependencies` to get a breadth first list of  dependencies in the order they are built.### Version 4.0.0: May 12 2019***BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE***- Removed support for parameter annotation aliases.  Use `@alias` on methods instead.  This was removed to allow `xeno` code to play nicely with PEP 484 type hinting.### Version 3.1.0: August 29 2018- Add ClassAttributes.for_object convenience method### Version 3.0.0: May 4 2018***BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE***- Provide injection interceptors with an alias map for the given param map.- This change breaks all existing injection interceptors until the new param is added.### Version 2.8.0: May 3 2018- Allow decorated/wrapped methods to be properly injected if their `'params'` method attribute  is carried forward.### Version 2.7.0: April 20 2018- The `Injector` now adds a `'resource-name'` attribute to resource methods allowing  the inspection of a resource's full canonical name at runtime.### Version 2.6.0: March 27 2018- Bugfix release: Remove support for implicit asynchronous resolution of  dependencies.  Providers can still be async, in order to await some other  set of coroutines, but can no longer themselves be run in sync.  The  benefits do not outweigh the complexity of bugs and timing concerns  introduced by this approach.### Version 2.5.0: March 2, 2018- Added `Injector.provide_async()`.  Note that resource are always run within an  event loop and should not use `inject()`, `provide()`, or `require()`  directly, instead they should use `inject_async()`, `provide_async()`, and  `require_async()` to dynamically modify resources.### Version 2.4.1: January 30, 2018- Added `Injector.scan_resources()` to allow users to scan for resource names with the given attributes.- Added `Attributes.merge()` to assist with passing attributes down to functions which are wrapped in a decorator.- Added `MethodAttributes.wraps()` static decorator to summarize a common use case of attribute merging.- Added `MethodAttributes.add()` as a simple static decorator to add attribute values to a method's attributes.### Version 2.4.0: January 21, 2018- Dropped support for deprecated `Namespace.enumerate()` in favor of `Namespace.get_leaves()`.### Version 2.3.0: January 21, 2018- Added support for asyncio-based concurrency and async provider coroutines with per-injector event loops (`injector.loop`).### Version 2.2.0: September 19, 2017- Expose the Injector's Namespace object via `Injector.get_namespace()`.  This is useful for users who want to list the contents of namespaces.### Version 2.1.0: August 23rd, 2017- Allow multiple resource names to be provided to `Injector.get_dependency_graph()`.### Version 2.0.0: July 25th, 2017***BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE***- Change the default namespace separator and breakout symbol to '/'Code using the old namespace separator can be made to work by overriding the value of xeno.Namespace.SEP:```import xenoxeno.Namespace.SEP = '::'```### Version 1.10: July 25th, 2017- Allow names prefixed with `::` to escape their module's namespace, e.g. `::top_level_item`### Version 1.9: May 23rd, 2017- Add `@const()` module annotation for value-based resources- Add `Injector.get_dependency_tree()` to fetch a tree of dependency names for a given resource name.### Version 1.8: May 16th, 2017- Add `MissingResourceError` and `MissingDependencyError` exception types.### Version 1.7: May 16th, 2017- Major update, adding support for namespaces, aliases, and inline resource parameter aliases.  See the unit tests in test.py for examples.  - Added `@namespace('Name')` decorator for modules to specify that all resources defined in the module should be scoped within 'Name::'.  - Added `@name('alt-name')` to allow resources to be named something other than the name of the function that defines them.  - Added `@alias('alt-name', 'name')` to allow a resource to be renamed within either the scope of a single resource or a whole module.  - Added `@using('NamespaceName')` to allow the contents of the given namespace    to be automatically aliases into either the scope of a single resource or    a whole module.  - Added support for resource function annotations via PEP 3107 to allow    inline aliases, e.g. `def my_resource(name: 'Name::something-important'):`### Version 1.6: April 26th, 2017- Changed how `xeno.MethodAttributes` works: it now holds a map of attributes  and provides methods `get()`, `put()`, and `check()`### Version 1.5: April 26th, 2017- Added injection interceptors- Refactored method tagging to use `xeno.MethodAttributes` instead of named  object attributes to make attribute tagging more flexible and usable by  the outside world, e.g. for the new injectors.### Version 1.4: August 30th, 2016- Added cycle detection.### Version 1.3: August 29th, 2016- Have the injector offer itself as a named resource named 'injector'.</longdescription>

	<longdescription>=====================Redis Tools (retools)=====================``retools`` is a package of Redis tools. It's aim is to provide a variety ofRedis backed Python tools that are always 100% unit tested, fast, efficient,and utilize the capabilities of Redis.Current tools in ``retools``:* Caching* Global LockOn the horizon for future implementation:* A worker/job processing system similar to Celery but based on how Ruby's  Resque system works... image:: https://secure.travis-ci.org/bbangert/retools.png?branch=master   :alt: Build Status   :target: https://secure.travis-ci.org/bbangert/retoolsCaching=======A high performance caching system that can act as a drop-in replacement forBeaker's caching. Unlike Beaker's caching, this utilizes Redis for distributedwrite-locking dogpile prevention. It also collects hit/miss cache statisticsalong with recording what regions are used by which functions and arguments.Example::        from retools.cache import CacheRegion, cache_region, invalidate_function        CacheRegion.add_region('short_term', expires=3600)        @cache_region('short_term')    def slow_function(*search_terms):        # Do a bunch of work        return results        my_results = slow_function('bunny')        # Invalidate the cache for 'bunny'    invalidate_function(slow_function, [], 'bunny')Differences from Beaker-----------------------Unlike Beaker's caching system, this is built strictly for Redis. As such, itadds several features that Beaker doesn't possess:* A distributed write-lock so that only one writer updates the cache at a time  across a cluster.* Hit/Miss cache statistics to give you insight into what caches are less  effectively utilized (and may need either higher expiration times, or just  not very worthwhile to cache).* Very small, compact code-base with 100% unit test coverage.Locking=======A Redis based lock implemented as a Python context manager, based on `ChrisLamb's example&lt;http://chris-lamb.co.uk/2010/06/07/distributing-locking-python-and-redis/&gt;`_.Example::        from retools.lock import Lock        with Lock('a_key', expires=60, timeout=10):        # do something that should only be done one at a timeLicense=======``retools`` is offered under the MIT license.Authors=======``retools`` is made available by `Ben Bangert`.=========Changelog=========0.4.1 (02/19/2014)==================Bug Fixes---------- Properly support StrictRedis with ZADD (used in the limiter). Patch by  Bernardo Heynemann.0.4 (01/27/2014)================Features--------- Added limiter functionality. Pull request #22, by Bernardo Heynemann.0.3 (08/13/2012)================Bug Fixes---------- Call redis.expire with proper expires value for RedisLock. Patch by  Mike McCabe.- Use functools.wraps to preserve doc strings for cache_region. Patch by  Daniel Holth.API Changes------------ Added get_job/get_jobs methods to QueueManager class to get information  on a job or get a list of jobs for a queue.0.2 (02/01/2012)================Bug Fixes---------- Critical fix for caching that prevents old values from being displayed  forever. Thanks to Daniel Holth for tracking down the problem-aware.- Actually sets the Redis expiration for a value when setting the cached  value in Redis. This defaults to 1 week.Features--------- Statistics for the cache is now optional and can be disabled to slightly  reduce the Redis queries used to store/retrieve cache data.- Added first revision of worker/job Queue system, with event support.Internals---------- Heavily refactored ``Connection`` to not be a class singleton, instead  a global_connection instance is created and used by default.- Increased conditional coverage to 100% (via instrumental_).Backwards Incompatibilities---------------------------- Changing the default global Redis connection has changed semantics, instead  of using ``Connection.set_default``, you should set the global_connection's  redis property directly::      import redis      from retools import global_connection      global_connection.redis = redis.Redis(host='myhost')Incompatibilities------------------ Removed clear argument from invalidate_region, as removing keys from the  set but not removing the hit statistics can lead to data accumulating in  Redis that has no easy removal other than .keys() which should not be run  in production environments.- Removed deco_args from invalidate_callable (invalidate_function) as its  not actually needed since the namespace is already on the callable to  invalidate.0.1 (07/08/2011)================Features--------- Caching in a similar style to Beaker, with hit/miss statistics, backed by  a Redis global write-lock with old values served to prevent the dogpile  effect- Redis global lock.. _instrumental: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/instrumental</longdescription>

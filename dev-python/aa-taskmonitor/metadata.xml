If you don't have Alliance Auth running already, please install it first before proceeding. (see the official [AA installation guide](https://allianceauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/auth/allianceauth/) for details)### Step 2 - Install appMake sure you are in the virtual environment (venv) of your Alliance Auth installation. Then install the newest release from PyPI:```bashpip install aa-taskmonitor```### Step 3 - Configure Auth settingsConfigure your Auth settings (`local.py`) as follows:- Add `'taskmonitor'` to `INSTALLED_APPS`- Optional: Add additional settings if you want to change any defaults. See [Settings](#settings) for the full list.### Step 4 - Finalize App installationRun migrations &amp; copy static files```bashpython manage.py migratepython manage.py collectstatic --noinput```Restart your supervisor services for Auth.## Command line utilityYou can manage your logs and queue also directly via a command line utility.The basic syntax for using the utility is:```bashpython manage.py taskmonitorctl {command} {target}```For example you can inspect your logs with:```bashpython manage.py taskmonitorctl inspect logs```Or for example you can purge your task queue with:```bashpython manage.py taskmonitorctl purge queue```To get an overview of available commands run:```bashpython manage.py taskmonitorctl --help```To get an overview of available targets for a command run:```bashpython manage.py taskmonitorctl inspect --help```## SettingsHere is a list of available settings for this app. They can be configured by adding them to your AA settings file (`local.py`).Note that all settings are optional and the app will use the documented default settings if they are not used.Name | Description | Default-- | -- | --`TASKMONITOR_ENABLED`| Global switch to enable/disable task monitor. | `True``TASKMONITOR_DATA_MAX_AGE`| Max age of logged tasks in hours. Older logs be deleted automatically. | `24``TASKMONITOR_DELETE_STALE_BATCH_SIZE`| Size of task logs deleted together in one batch. | `5_000``TASKMONITOR_HOUSEKEEPING_FREQUENCY`| Frequency of house keeping runs in minutes. | `15``TASKMONITOR_QUEUED_TASKS_CACHE_TIMEOUT`| Timeout for caching queued tasks in seconds. | `10``TASKMONITOR_QUEUED_TASKS_ADMIN_LIMIT`| The admin page will stop showing the list of queued tasks above this limit to protect against crashing caused by too high memory consumption. | `100_000``TASKMONITOR_REPORTS_MAX_AGE`| Max age of cached reports in minutes. | `30``TASKMONITOR_REPORTS_MAX_TOP`| Max items to show in the top reports. e.g. 10 will shop the top ten items. | `15``TASKMONITOR_TRUNCATE_NESTED_DATA`| Whether deeply nested task params and results are truncated. Please see FAQ for details. | `True`## FAQ### Is it possible to store task logs longer then for just 24 hours?Yes, there is a setting, which you can increase according to your needs. However, please keep in mind that your storage needs will increase accordingly. The current approx. usage is 0.5 KB per entry, so e.g. you need approx. 500 MB to store 1.000.000 task logs. Note that you can use the command line utility to find out how much space your logs are currently using.### How is this app different from celery analytics?Celery Analytics seams to be designed mainly as data source for reports on Grafana. It apparently works great if you want to integrate analysis about your task executions into a Grafana dashboards. But it's usability without Grafana is limited.Task Monitor on the other hand aims to be fully functional standalone by providing reports and many useful features for analyzing your task logs directly on the admin site. It also provides a more complete picture, since Celery Analytics ignores retried tasks.## How is this app different from celery's flower?Flower offers more detailed and technical information about task runs and might  therefore be more most for developers. However, it not designed to store a larger number of task logs (default is only 10K) and is appears therefore to be less suited for Alliance Auth, where you typically have 100K+ tasks per day.## What does data truncating do exactly?Task Monitor has data truncating enabled by default. It is applied when storing args, kwargs and results in task logs. This helps to reduce the storage consumptions and also makes the task log better readable. But it can be turned off.Task args are truncated by clearing all nested containers.Example: `[1, [2, 3], 4]` becomes `[1, [], 4]`Task kwargs are truncated by clearing all nested containers in values.Example: `{&quot;a&quot;: [1, 2], &quot;b&quot;: 3}` becomes `{&quot;a&quot;: [], &quot;b&quot;: 3}`Finally, task results are truncated like args and kwargs depending on their type. In addition lists of empty containers are compressed.Example: `[ [], [], [] ]` becomes `[]`</longdescription>

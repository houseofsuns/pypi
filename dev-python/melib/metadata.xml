	<longdescription>`pip install melib`Documentation : https://melib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/There are three files in this package:* library.py -- a collection of small functions that can be used to execute small tasks associated with the design of mechanical components such as belts and chains, gears, rotating shafts, keys, bearings, welded joints, welded structures, fasteners, etc.  The module is designed to be used in teaching machine element design to second-year mechanical students. To motivate learning of procedures and relevant standards, there are no pushbutton complete designs. Unless otherwise specified, the formula and data reference is ‘Machine Elements in Mechanical Design’ by Mott.  There is a collection of Excel data files that are accessed by the library. These files are in the data folder. This is not a comprehensive machine design library but sufficient for preparing assignments, examples and exam questions.* xt.py -- Functions that can be called upon to generate jupyter notebooks for documenting the mechanical design tasks. It also has functions to create pdf documents* excel.py -- functions to read and write Microsoft Excel files. It uses the python package openpyxl.This was the first project I registered in `PyPi` uploaded to `GitHub` with documentation atuomatically generated using `ReadTheDocs`.I document every step to help others and future self in similar endeavours.# Construct local repository #I create a local folder `melib` and copy `LICENSE`, `pyproject.toml` and `setup.cfg` into this folder.* `mkdir melib`* `cd melib`* `copy` the python libraries and the `data` folder into `melib`* `mkdir docs`This is the folder structure at this stage:![alt text](assets/folder0.png)* `cd docs`* `sphinx-quickstart````  Separate source and build directories (y/n)[n]: Pick the default ([n])    Project name: hgdemo    Author name(s): H Gurgenci    Project release []: June 2021    Project language [en]: __  ```This creates an intial directory structure as seen below:![alt text](assets/folder1.png)The next step is to edit the files `index.rst` and `conf.py` (they are two files sphinxcreated in the `docs` folder and are marked in the figure above.We will also create a new file `api.rst` in the same folder.  Incidentally, the VS Code,did not automatically update the folder pane after `sphinx-quickstart`.  One needsto refresh to see the new files and folders in `docs`.__index.rst__This is the file after I edit it:```.. melib documentation master file, created by   sphinx-quickstart on Tue Jun  8 09:34:23 2021.Welcome to melib's documentation!=================================The melib package has three files: library, xt, and excel.The first one is a library of functions that can be usedto do machine element design computations.

I copied the extension list from the `conf` file in the `psf/requests`repository on github.  I probably did not need them all.  Anyway, here they are.```extensions = [    &quot;sphinx.ext.autodoc&quot;,    &quot;sphinx.ext.intersphinx&quot;,    &quot;sphinx.ext.todo&quot;,    &quot;sphinx.ext.viewcode&quot;,]```__api.rst__This is a new file:```melib API reference===================.. module:: melib.. automodule:: melib.library    :members:.. automodule:: melib.xt    :members:.. automodule:: melib.excel    :members:The data folder has design data that are needed by the functions in the library.py file.```Before running `./make html` to generate the local documentation pages, I copy theimage files I need into the `assets` folder.  These image files are referred toby doc strings in the `library` and `xt` files.  For example, the reference tothe file `shoulderscf.png` in `library.py` is```            .. image:: ../../assets/shoulderscf.png```The local addressing is all with respect to the `docs` folder.This completes the local documentation.  Let us now generate a `github` repository.__IMPORTANT__ Make sure you import the `mock` repository.  Otherwise, `./make html`will not work after we do the mock imports of the next section below.  In VS Code_Powershell_ terminal, enter `py -m pip install mock` and it will install `mock`in the python kernel that is used by VS Code.  Incidentally, `py -m pip` isalways better than just `pip` because it makes sure that the packe is imported intothe python kernek you are using.  Otherwise, confusion may occur when you have multiplepython versions installed on your computer.# Construct remote repository #`git add -A`&lt;br&gt;`git commit -am` 'the first commit'&lt;br&gt;`git branch -M main`&lt;br&gt;`git remote add origin https://github.com/Gurgenci/melib.git`&lt;br&gt;`git push -u origin main`# Remote documentation #I will generate documentation using `ReadtheDocs`.  For a package like `melib` thatneeds to import other packages, the dependencies need to be stated up front.  Otherwise,`ReadtheDocs` will fail.I create a new file called `requirements.txt` in the `docs` folder:```numpy&gt;=1.0pylatex&gt;=1.0openpyxl&gt;=1.0```Now add this file to the `git` repository:`git add -A`&lt;br&gt;`git commit -am 'with the new file requirements.txt'`&lt;br&gt;`git push -u origin main`* Log in to `ReadtheDocs.org`* Import a repository (melib should appear as an available option)The import click will invoke the following menu.![alt text](assets/rtd01.png)Simply press the `Next` button to get to![alt text](assets/rtd02.png)Then click on the `Build version` button.  When the `Build` is finished, clickon the `View docs` button.Unfortunately, this did not work.  The document generator failed to import myfiles `library`, `xt`, and `excel` and issued the following warnings:```WARNING: autodoc: failed to import module 'library' from module 'melib'; the following exception was raised:No module named 'numpy'WARNING: autodoc: failed to import module 'xt' from module 'melib'; the following exception was raised:No module named 'pylatex'WARNING: autodoc: failed to import module 'excel' from module 'melib'; the following exception was raised:No module named 'openpyxl'looking for now-outdated files... none found```This was a surprise because I tested the use of a `requirements.txt` in asimpler package, `hgdemo`.  There, `ReadtheDocs` managed to import a module that \referenced `numpy` after I included a `requirements.txt` file with a `numpy` line.This approach did not work for `melib`.I decided to try an approach suggested in http://blog.rtwilson.com/how-to-make-your-sphinx-documentation-compile-with-readthedocs-when-youre-using-numpy-and-scipy/.  The suggestion is to include the following code at the top of the `conf.py` file:```import mockMOCK_MODULES = ['numpy', 'scipy', 'matplotlib', 'matplotlib.pyplot', 'scipy.interpolate',                'pylatex', 'openpyxl',                'pylatex.Document',                ]for mod_name in MOCK_MODULES:    sys.modules[mod_name] = mock.Mock()```This made the `No module named 'pylatex'` and similar messages disappear from the `raw log`.But the documentation still did not include anything on `library`, `xt` and `excel` contents.I then realised that it is not enough to _mock_ a package but you need to _mock_every module you import from it.  For example, for `pylatex.utils` you get```No module named 'pylatex.utils'; 'pylatex' is not a package```All packages and its sub-packages must be added to the 'MOCK-MODULES' in `conf.py`.The objects imported from those packages do not need to be included in `MOCK-MODULES`.For example, if `'pylatex.utils' in MOCK_MODULES`, then the line `from openpyxl.utils import get_column_letter` is safe.  However, `from openpyxl.utils.cell import coordinate_from_string` is not acceptable.  One needs to add `openpyxl.utils.cell` to `MOCK_MODULES`Incidentally, when you do a `rebuild` in ReadtheDocs, you must make sure that ReadtheDocsis project database is updated with your latest `git push`.  Otherwise, `Build Docs`will fail and it is an ugly process to recover from it.  So make sure that thetime since last built is as you expect it:![alt text](assets/rtd03.png)Sometimes, it takes a relatively long time for this time to reset to your last commit.Once it was 15 minutes for me.If all works well, the documentation will be created on http://hgdemo.readthedocs.io/# Upload to PyPi #Finally, the `melib` package is uploaded to `PyPi` so that it can be `pip`ped by others.This is done through the following process:* Start an account with https://pypi.org/ if you do not have one already* Once you have your `PyPi` account, create an API token through https://pypi.org/manage/account/ (scroll down that page and you will see the section)![alt text](assets/api_token_pypi.png)If you follow the `PyPi` defaults, this token is stored in `$HOME/.pypirc`, on my systemthe token file name was `C:\Users\e4hgurge\.pypirc`* The root folder for the following steps is &quot;git/melib&quot; in my system.* Create two files in the root folder: _setup.cfg_ and _pyproject.toml_ (see the  `github` repository for the contants of these files)* Create a file called `LICENSE` (no extensions)  * I use GNU General Public License (from https://choosealicense.com/).  I  copied the license text to the clipboard on this page and pasted it into the  file `setup.cfg`.* Increment the version in `setup.cfg`* Make sure that we running the latest version of `pip`:  * `py -m pip install --upgrade pip`* Make sure that we running the latest version of `build`:  * `py -m pip install --upgrade build`* Now run `build` in the root folder  * `py -m build`* This will generate the `dist` folder with the following two files in it:  * `dist\hgdemo-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl`  * `dist\hgdemo-0.0.1.tar.gz`* If you are using VS Code, refresh the folder pane contents to see the changes.* Now run `twine` to upload these two files to TestPyPi:  * `py -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*`This worked.  Now let us do the same for PyPi:* `py -m twine upload dist/*`This sometime gives `HTTPError: 400 Bad Request ...`Even when you change your version, this sometimes happens.* `py -m twine upload --skip-existing dist/*` sometimes works.# Including the data files in PyPi upload #https://packaging.python.org/guides/using-manifest-in/ lists the following files as those included in a source distribution by default:* all Python and C source files* files specified in `scripts_setup()`, `package_data`, and `data_files setup()`*  `license_file` and `license_files` as specified in `setup.cfg`* all files `test/test*.py`, `setup.py` and/or `setup.cfg`* `README.md` and some other `README` extensions, and* `MANIFEST.in`.I have a `data` directory with five Excel files.  I tried a few things to include them in the PyPi distribution and the following addition to `setup.cfg` worked:```[options.data_files]data = melib/data/mats.xlsx, melib/data/bearing.xlsx, melib/data/sgear.xlsx, melib/data/shaft.xlsx,melib/data/vbelt.xlsx```I included the files all one line and with no spaces after the commas.  But I do not think this matters.  Incidentally, using wild cars like `melib/data/*.xlsx` ibstead of listing all five files separately did not work.# Final Steps #* Go to the root directory of the package* `git status`* `git add -A`* `git commit -am &quot;Final Commit for the version 1.0.0 following the pypi upload&quot;`* `git push -u origin main`* Log in to https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/ and clock on the project `melib`* Click on [Build Version] after making sure that the last built is the one youjust `push`ed.  The only way you can tell is by the time (e.g. `3 minutes ago`).Refresh the page if necessary.* Documentation will be created on https://melib.readthedocs.io# Additional issues ### PyPi Upload Failure ##I have already mentioned the occasional error message:```HTTPError: 400 Bad Request from https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/File already exists. See https://pypi.org/help/#file-name-reuse for more information.```This happens when I fail to change the version number in `setup.cfg` (for example, if I try to upload version 1.0.11 again).  When I change the version number (e.g. 1.0.12), I occasionally still get the same error.  Deleting the `dist` and `melib.egg-info` folders before the `build` work in such circumstances.  At the end, I get into the habit of deleting the `dist` and `melib.eff-info` folders after every upload - just in case.## PIP Failure ##Sometimes, `pip` decides not to download the new version.  It says that the version I have is already current and no update is needed.  In such instances, deleting the local version always work.I have two python installations: one was generated when I installed `anaconda` and the other through `VS code`.  They are in two separate `site-packages` folders:* `...\Anaconda3\Lib\site-packages` and* `...\.julia\conda\3\Lib\site-packages`I delete both `melib` folders in both of them because I read somewhere that sometimes `pip` decides to save on communications bandwidth and installs a local version of the library rather than going to `PyPi`.  I have not experienced it (I think) but I playe it safe just in case.# VS Code and spyder #Finally, I do all `PyPi` builds and `twine` uploading in `VS Code` and then go to `spyder`, `pip` the new `melib` library and test it there.  I hardly use `python` in `VS Code`.  </longdescription>

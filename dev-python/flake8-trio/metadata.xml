	<longdescription># flake8-trioA highly opinionated flake8 plugin for [Trio](https://github.com/python-trio/trio)-related problems.This can include anything from outright bugs, to pointless/dead code,to likely performance issues, to minor points of idiom that might signala misunderstanding.It may well be too noisy for anyone with different opinions, that's OK.It also supports the [anyio](https://github.com/agronholm/anyio) library.Pairs well with flake8-bugbear.## Installation```consolepip install flake8-trio```## List of warnings- **TRIO100**: A `with trio.fail_after(...):` or `with trio.move_on_after(...):`  context does not contain any `await` statements.  This makes it pointless, as  the timeout can only be triggered by a checkpoint.- **TRIO101**: `yield` inside a nursery or cancel scope is only safe when implementing a context manager - otherwise, it breaks exception handling.- **TRIO102**: It's unsafe to await inside `finally:` or `except BaseException/trio.Cancelled` unless you use a shielded  cancel scope with a timeout.- **TRIO103**: `except BaseException`, `except trio.Cancelled` or a bare `except:` with a code path that doesn't re-raise. If you don't want to re-raise `BaseException`, add a separate handler for `trio.Cancelled` before.- **TRIO104**: `Cancelled` and `BaseException` must be re-raised - when a user tries to `return` or `raise` a different exception.- **TRIO105**: Calling a trio async function without immediately `await`ing it.- **TRIO106**: `trio` must be imported with `import trio` for the linter to work.- **TRIO107**: Renamed to TRIO910- **TRIO108**: Renamed to TRIO911- **TRIO109**: Async function definition with a `timeout` parameter - use `trio.[fail/move_on]_[after/at]` instead- **TRIO110**: `while &lt;condition&gt;: await trio.sleep()` should be replaced by a `trio.Event`.- **TRIO111**: Variable, from context manager opened inside nursery, passed to `start[_soon]` might be invalidly accessed while in use, due to context manager closing before the nursery. This is usually a bug, and nurseries should generally be the inner-most context manager.- **TRIO112**: Nursery body with only a call to `nursery.start[_soon]` and not passing itself as a parameter can be replaced with a regular function call.- **TRIO113**: Using `nursery.start_soon` in `__aenter__` doesn't wait for the task to begin. Consider replacing with `nursery.start`.- **TRIO114**: Startable function (i.e. has a `task_status` keyword parameter) not in `--startable-in-context-manager` parameter list, please add it so TRIO113 can catch errors when using it.- **TRIO115**: Replace `trio.sleep(0)` with the more suggestive `trio.lowlevel.checkpoint()`.- **TRIO116**: `trio.sleep()` with &gt;24 hour interval should usually be `trio.sleep_forever()`.- **TRIO117**: Don't raise or catch `trio.[NonBase]MultiError`, prefer `[exceptiongroup.]BaseExceptionGroup`. Even if Trio still raises `MultiError` for legacy code, it can be caught with `BaseExceptionGroup` so it's fully redundant.- **TRIO118**: Don't assign the value of `anyio.get_cancelled_exc_class()` to a variable, since that breaks linter checks and multi-backend programs.### Warnings for blocking sync calls in async functions- **TRIO200**: User-configured error for blocking sync calls in async functions. Does nothing by default, see [`trio200-blocking-calls`](#trio200-blocking-calls) for how to configure it.- **TRIO210**: Sync HTTP call in async function, use `httpx.AsyncClient`.- **TRIO211**: Likely sync HTTP call in async function, use `httpx.AsyncClient`. Looks for `urllib3` method calls on pool objects, but only matching on the method signature and not the object.- **TRIO212**: Blocking sync HTTP call on httpx object, use httpx.AsyncClient.- **TRIO220**: Sync process call in async function, use `await nursery.start(trio.run_process, ...)`.- **TRIO221**: Sync process call in async function, use `await trio.run_process(...)`.- **TRIO222**: Sync `os.*` call in async function, wrap in `await trio.to_thread.run_sync()`.- **TRIO230**: Sync IO call in async function, use `trio.open_file(...)`.- **TRIO231**: Sync IO call in async function, use `trio.wrap_file(...)`.- **TRIO232**: Blocking sync call on file object, wrap the file object in `trio.wrap_file()` to get an async file object.- **TRIO240**: Avoid using `os.path` in async functions, prefer using `trio.Path` objects.### Warnings disabled by default- **TRIO900**: Async generator without `@asynccontextmanager` not allowed.- **TRIO910**: Exit or `return` from async function with no guaranteed checkpoint or exception since function definition.- **TRIO911**: Exit, `yield` or `return` from async iterable with no guaranteed checkpoint since possible function entry (yield or function definition)  Checkpoints are `await`, `async for`, and `async with` (on one of enter/exit).## Examples### install and run through flake8```shpip install flake8 flake8-trioflake8 .```### install and run with pre-commitIf you use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/), you can use it with flake8-trio byadding the following to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:```yamlminimum_pre_commit_version: '2.9.0'repos:- repo: https://github.com/Zac-HD/flake8-trio  rev: 23.5.1  hooks:    - id: flake8-trio      # args: [--enable=TRIO, --disable=TRIO9, --autofix=TRIO]```This is often considerably faster for large projects, because `pre-commit`can avoid running `flake8-trio` on unchanged files.Afterwards, run```shpip install pre-commit flake8-triopre-commit run .```### install and run as standaloneIf inside a git repository, running without arguments will run it against all `*.py` files in the repository.```shpip install flake8-trioflake8-trio```#### with autofixes```shflake8-trio --autofix=TRIO```#### specifying source files```shflake8-trio my_python_file.py```##### zsh-only```zshflake8-trio **/*.py```## Configuration[You can configure `flake8` with command-line options](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/configuration.html),but we prefer using a config file. The file needs to start with a section marker `[flake8]` and the following options are then parsed using flake8's config parser, and can be used just like any other flake8 options.Note that it's not currently possible to use a configuration file when running `flake8-trio` standalone.### `--enable`Comma-separated list of error codes to enable, similar to flake8 --select but is additionally more performant as it will disable non-enabled visitors from running instead of just silencing their errors.### `--disable`Comma-separated list of error codes to disable, similar to flake8 --ignore but is additionally more performant as it will disable non-enabled visitors from running instead of just silencing their errors.### `--autofix`Comma-separated list of error-codes to enable autofixing for if implemented. Requires running as a standalone program. Pass `--autofix=TRIO` to enable all autofixes.### `--error-on-autofix`Whether to also print an error message for autofixed errors.### `--anyio`Change the default library to be anyio instead of trio. If trio is imported it will assume both are available and print suggestions with [anyio|trio].### `no-checkpoint-warning-decorators`Comma-separated list of decorators to disable checkpointing checks for, turning off TRIO910 and TRIO911 warnings for functions decorated with any decorator matching any in the list. Matching is done with [fnmatch](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html). Defaults to disabling for `asynccontextmanager`.Decorators-to-match must be identifiers or dotted names only (not PEP-614 expressions), and will match against the name only - e.g. `foo.bar` matches `foo.bar`, `foo.bar()`, and `foo.bar(args, here)`, etc.For example:```no-checkpoint-warning-decorators =  mydecorator,  mydecoratorpackage.checkpointing_decorators.*,  ign*,  *.ignore,```### `startable-in-context-manager`Comma-separated list of methods which should be used with `.start()` when opening a context manager,in addition to the default `trio.run_process`, `trio.serve_tcp`, `trio.serve_ssl_over_tcp`, and`trio.serve_listeners`.  Names must be valid identifiers as per `str.isidentifier()`. For example:```startable-in-context-manager =  myfun,  myfun2,```### `trio200-blocking-calls`Comma-separated list of pairs of values separated by `-&gt;` (optional whitespace stripped), where the first is a pattern for a call that should raise an error if found inside an async function, and the second is what should be suggested to use instead. It uses fnmatch as per [`no-checkpoint-warning-decorators`](#no-checkpoint-warning-decorators) for matching. The part after `-&gt;` is not used by the checker other than when printing the error, so you could add extra info there if you want.The format of the error message is `User-configured blocking sync call {0} in async function, consider replacing with {1}.`, where `{0}` is the pattern the call matches and `{1}` is the suggested replacement.Example:```initrio200-blocking-calls =  my_blocking_call -&gt; async.alternative,  module.block_call -&gt; other_function_to_use,  common_error_call -&gt; alternative(). But sometimes you should use other_function(). Ask joe if you're unsure which one,  dangerous_module.* -&gt; corresponding function in safe_module,  *.dangerous_call -&gt; .safe_call()```Specified patterns must not have parentheses, and will only match when the pattern is the name of a call, so given the above configuration```pythonasync def my_function():    my_blocking_call()  # this would raise an error    x = my_blocking_call(a, b, c)  # as would this    y = my_blocking_call  # but not this    y()  # or this    [my_blocking_call][0]()  # nor this    def my_blocking_call():  # it's also safe to use the name in other contexts        ...    arbitrary_other_function(my_blocking_call=None)```# Changelog*[CalVer, YY.month.patch](https://calver.org/)*## 23.5.1- TRIO91X now supports comprehensions- TRIO100 and TRIO91X now supports autofixing- Renamed `--enable-visitor-codes-regex` to `--enable`- Added `--disable`, `--autofix` and `--error-on-autofix`## 23.2.5- Fix false alarms for `@pytest.fixture`-decorated functions in TRIO101, TRIO910 and TRIO911## 23.2.4- Fix TRIO900 false alarm on nested functions- TRIO113 now also works on `anyio.TaskGroup`## 23.2.3- Fix get_matching_call when passed a single string as base.

This is usually a bug, and nurseries should generally be the inner-most context manager.- Add TRIO112: this single-task nursery could be replaced by awaiting the function call directly.## 22.8.4- Fix TRIO108 raising errors on yields in some sync code.- TRIO109 now skips all decorated functions to avoid false alarms## 22.8.3- TRIO108 now gives multiple error messages; one for each path lacking a guaranteed checkpoint## 22.8.2- Merged TRIO108 into TRIO107- TRIO108 now handles checkpointing in async iterators## 22.8.1- Added TRIO109: Async definitions should not have a `timeout` parameter. Use `trio.[fail/move_on]_[at/after]`- Added TRIO110: `while &lt;condition&gt;: await trio.sleep()` should be replaced by a `trio.Event`.## 22.7.6- Extend TRIO102 to also check inside `except BaseException` and `except trio.Cancelled`- Extend TRIO104 to also check for `yield`- Update error messages on TRIO102 and TRIO103## 22.7.5- Add TRIO103: `except BaseException` or `except trio.Cancelled` with a code path that doesn't re-raise- Add TRIO104: &quot;Cancelled and BaseException must be re-raised&quot; if user tries to return or raise a different exception.- Added TRIO107: Async functions must have at least one checkpoint on every code path, unless an exception is raised- Added TRIO108: Early return from async function must have at least one checkpoint on every code path before it.## 22.7.4- Added TRIO105 check for not immediately `await`ing async trio functions.- Added TRIO106 check that trio is imported in a form that the plugin can easily parse.## 22.7.3- Added TRIO102 check for unsafe checkpoints inside `finally:` blocks## 22.7.2- Avoid `TRIO100` false-alarms on cancel scopes containing `async for` or `async with`.## 22.7.1- Initial release with TRIO100 and TRIO101</longdescription>

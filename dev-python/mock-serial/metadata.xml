	<longdescription># mock_serialA mock utility for testing serial devices.Credit to [Dolf Andringa](http://allican.be/blog/2017/01/15/python-dummy-serial-port.html) for the technique. 🏆## Install```pip install mock_serial```Note: this package [does not work on Windows](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52062977/unable-to-import-termios-package).## UsageFirst setup a basic session with a `MockSerial` device.```pythonfrom mock_serial import MockSerialdevice = MockSerial()device.open()from serial import Serialserial = Serial(device.port)...serial.close()device.close()```Alternatively, a pytest fixture is included automatically.```from serial import Serialdef test_example(mock_serial):  serial = Serial(device.port)  ...  serial.close()```### `.stub()`Use the `.stub()` method to simulate device behaviour.```pythonstub = device.stub(  receive_bytes=b'123',  send_bytes=b'456')...serial.write(b'123')assert serial.read(3) == b'456'assert stub.calledassert stub.calls == 1```You can also give your stub a name for easy retrieval.```pythondevice.stub(  name='foo',  receive_bytes=b'123',  send_bytes=b'456')...assert device.stubs['foo'].called````stub()` can simulate a variety of device behaviours:- **Lazy matching**. MockSerial will defer sending a response until only one stub could match. This can be useful if certain byte sequences are ambiguous e.g. if another stub had `receive_bytes = b'123456'` then MockSerial will wait until it can rule out matching the &quot;longer&quot; stub in future.- **Partial matching**. MockSerial doesn't need to match all the data it's read in one go. This can be useful if your code or library doesn't wait for replies e.g. `b'123'` followed quickly by `b'456'` may be received as `b'123456'`, but will be correctly matched if there are stubs for them both.Note: you must ensure there is a stub to match each part of the byte sequence, **otherwise MockSerial will stop responding**. MockSerial does not support &quot;regex&quot; or &quot;placeholder&quot; matching.## AdvancedMockSerial supports overriding stubs by `name` or `receive_bytes`. This can be useful if you want to define most of your stubs once, but override the `send_bytes` for one or two of them in specific tests.```pythondevice.stub(  receive_bytes=b'123',  send_bytes=b'456')...device.stub(  receive_bytes=b'123',  send_bytes=b'789')serial.write(b'123')assert serial.read(3) == b'789'```Stubs can also return a dynamic response by passing a `send_fn` instead of `send_bytes`. The function should accept a single argument: the number of times the stub has been called, including the current call.```pythondevice.stub(  receive_bytes=b'123',  send_fn=lambda n: bytes(str(n), encoding='utf-8') + b'23')serial.write(b'123123')assert serial.read(6) == b'123223'```## DebuggingMockSerial has lots of `DEBUG` logs so you can see what it's doing. It may also log a warning if it has trouble closing. This can be helpful if you're trying to debug how it's interacting with your code.```pythonimport logging, syslogging.basicConfig(  stream=sys.stdout,  level=logging.DEBUG,  format=&quot;%(levelname)s - %(message)s&quot;)...```This is a rough example of what the logs look like.```DEBUG - Attached to mock serial port.DEBUG - Buffer read: b'123'.DEBUG - Potential matches: [b'1234' =&gt; b'456', b'1235' =&gt; fn()].DEBUG - Buffer read: b'12341235'.DEBUG - Match stub: b'1234' =&gt; b'456'.DEBUG - Buffer write: b'456'.DEBUG - Match stub: b'1235' =&gt; fn().DEBUG - Buffer write: b'123'.DEBUG - Detaching mock serial port.DEBUG - Buffer read: b'mockserialquit'.DEBUG - Detached mock serial port.DEBUG - Closing mock serial port.DEBUG - Closed mock serial port.```As you can see, MockSerial sends itself a special control sequence when closing. This signals to the worker thread to detach from the mock serial port, which is (sometimes) necessary in order to close it.## ContributingSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).## LicenceSee [LICENCE](LICENCE).</longdescription>

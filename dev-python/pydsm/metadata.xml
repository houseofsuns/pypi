	<longdescription>PyDSM=====This is a Python/Scipy toolbox for the design and simulation ofΔΣ Modulators, with emphasis on digital modulators.Currently, it focuses on tools for the design of the modulator NTF. Italso includes a fast simulator for digital modulators. Furthermore, itincludes a Python/Scipy port of some functions from the `DELSIGtoolbox&lt;http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/19-delta-sigma-toolbox&gt;`__by R. Schreier.The code includes an original NTF design technique fully described in thepapers:* Sergio Callegari, Federico Bizzarri *“Output Filter Aware  Optimization of the Noise Shaping Properties of ΔΣ Modulators via  Semi-Definite Programming”*, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and  systems - Part I: Regular Papers, Vol. 60, N. 9,  pp. 2352-2365.

Note that this implies a minor API breakage.   - Implement new hybrid NTF design method   - Slightly improve accuracy of weighted NTF design functions   - Improve quantization_noise_gain function   - Improve html documentation   - Let multiple modelers be selected in functions using convex     optimization (cvxpy, cvxpy_old and picos are supported)   - Implement some more functions in delsig module (axisLabels, rms)   - Many small fixes0.11.0   - Switch to setuptools for building   - Improve testing framework   - Better management of optional parameters in some functions   - API cleanups     (a best effort has been put in retaining back-compatibility. Some     back compatibility functions are deprecated and will be removed)   - Code style improvements0.10.1   - Fix setup script for compatibility with MacOs   - Provide getting started guide for MacOs   - Minor fixes in documentation0.10.0   - Ready setup script for distribution   - Implement ``partitionABCD`` in delsig module   - Make delsig module PEP8 compliant   - Some minor improvements to utility functions0.9.1   - Apply some fixes to the modulator simulator   - Make building for 64 bit windows possible   - Implement ``clans`` NTF design method   - Implement ``minmax`` NTF design method     (only single band LP, so far)0.9.0   - Include a local version of the discontinued cvxpy package     by Tomas Tinoco de Ribera. This is a temporary measure0.8.3   - Fix a typo in the fast DSM simulator     (only affecting case where modulator structure is passed in ABCD form)   - Add example from ICECS 2013 paper   - Enhance ``quantization_weighted_noise_gain`` function0.8.2   - Fix some licensing issues0.8.1   - Prevent synthesizeNTF failure if there are no zeros to optimize   - Improve some docstrings   - Remove some spurious imports   - Fix normalization in quantization_noise_gain functions0.8.0   - Add NTF design method based on a noise weighting function   - Provide a new module with standard audio weighting functions   - Provide a new module with ISO 226 equal loudness contours   - Provide a new module with NTF design methods for psychoacoustically     optimal modulators for audio signals   - Fix a regression in ``ds_optzeros`` introduced with version 0.7.3     and preventing some example code from running   - Add new examples from a recently published TCAS-II paper   - Use ``'ba'`` specifier for requiring filters in numerator/denominator form   - Make ``evalTF`` function more robust against complex overflow   - Bug fixes0.7.3   - Apply fixes introduced in DELSIG 7.4   - Make port of DELSIG functions more consistent with DELSIG   - Provide better documentation to some functions   - Bug fixes0.7.2   - Make codebase compatible with scipy 0.12.0   - Make delsig module contain its reference delsig version   - Minor fixes to the documentation0.7.1   - Fix computation of impulse response of filters that are already in     FIR form.   - Avoid direct access to numpy array data in Cython code. This is in     preparation for future releases of numpy where direct access to     array data is already deprecated.   - Implement the synthesizeChebyshevNTF NTF design strategy from DELSIG.0.7.0   - Dropped dependency on ATLAS on Windows. Now using the blas functions     made available via scipy. The linux version still uses ATLAS that has     a little performance advantage.   - Much simpler installation on Windows   - API changes: renamed ``synthezize_ntf_from_filter_ir`` into     ``synthezize_ntf_from_filter_imp``; swapped param order in     ``q0_from_filter_imp_response``.   - Fixed passing of options to ``synthesize_ntf_from_q0`` and     ``synthesize_ntf_from_filter_imp``0.6.1   - Add project logo to the project source   - Ship html documentation separately from main code   - Add sample code to replicate the results in an ICECS 2012 paper0.6.0   First released version</longdescription>

	<longdescription>=============================Mutable History For Mercurial=============================Evolve Extension================This package supplies the evolve extension for Mercurial,**The full implementation of the changeset evolution concept is still inprogress.**  Please subscribe to the `evolve-testers mailing list&lt;https://www.mercurial-scm.org/mailman/listinfo/evolve-testers&gt;`_ to stay up todate with changes.This extension:* enables the &quot;`changeset evolution`_&quot; feature of core Mercurial,* provides a set of commands to rewrite history in a distributed way,* issues various warning messages when &quot;troubles&quot; from changeset evolution  appear in your repository,* provides an ``hg evolve`` command to deal with such troubles,* improves performance of obsolescence marker exchange and discovery during  push and pull... _`changeset evolution`: https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/ChangesetEvolutionDocumentation-------------We recommend reading the documentation first. An online version is availablehere:    https://www.mercurial-scm.org/doc/evolution/Source of the documentation can be found in ``docs/``.How to Install==============Using Pip---------You can install the latest released version using pip::    $ pip install --user hg-evolveThen enable it in your hgrc::    $ hg config --edit # add these two lines:    [extensions]    evolve =From Source-----------To install a local version from source::    $ hg clone https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/evolve/    $ cd evolve    # optionally `hg update &lt;target revision&gt;`    $ pip install --user .Then enable it in your hgrc::    $ hg config --edit # add these two lines:    [extensions]    evolve =It's also possible to use evolve without installing it, in which case you willneed to provide the full path to ``hgext3rd/evolve/``, for example::    [extensions]    evolve = ~/evolve/hgext3rd/evolvePitfalls--------If you get ``&quot;failed to import extension evolve: No module named 'evolve'&quot;``error, there are a couple of things to check:* make sure you gave pip the correct package name (it's hg-evolve),* make sure evolve is installed for the same version of Python that you use for  running Mercurial (``hg debuginstall | grep Python``).Server-only Setup=================It is possible to enable a smaller subset of the features aimed at servers thatsimply serve repositories::    $ hg config --edit # add these two lines:    [extensions]    evolve.serveronly =It skips the additions of the new commands and local UI messages that might addperformance overhead.Extension Purpose=================The goal of this extension is to provide an appropriate place for code andconcepts related to `changeset evolution`_ to mature. In this extension weallow hackier code, unlocking quick experimentation and faster iterations.In addition, evolve extension supports a wide range of Mercurial versions,allowing us to reach a larger user base for feedback. The extension is not tiedto the Mercurial release cycle and can release new features and bug fixes at ahigher rate if necessary.Once a concept is deemed ready, its implementation is moved into coreMercurial. The maturation period helped us to get a clearer picture of what wasneeded. During the upstreaming process, we can use this clearer picture toclean up the code and upgrade it to an appropriate quality for core Mercurial.Python 3 Support================Mercurial announced official `support for Python 3`_ starting with its 5.2release. Since 9.3.0, evolve has official support for Python 3.6+... _`support for Python 3`: https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/Python3Python 2 Support================Python 2 is supported by evolve. However, Mercurial 6.2 release dropped supportfor it, so evolve can work on Python 2 only on earlier versions.Debian packages that are built using Heptapod CI only install files for Python3, because they target current Debian stable.How to Contribute=================Discussion happens in #hg-evolve and #mercurial on libera_ IRC network... _libera: https://libera.chat/Bugs are to be reported on the Mercurial's bug tracker (component:`evolution`_)... _evolution: https://bz.mercurial-scm.org/buglist.cgi?component=evolution&amp;query_format=advanced&amp;resolution=---The recommended way to submit a patch is to create a Merge Request onhttps://foss.heptapod.net/mercurial/evolve. To do so, create an account andrequest access. You'll then be able to create a topic-based merge request.Alternatively, you can use the patchbomb extension to send email to `mercurialdevel &lt;https://www.mercurial-scm.org/mailman/listinfo/mercurial-devel&gt;`_.Please make sure to use the evolve-ext flag when doing so. You can use acommand like this::    $ hg email --to mercurial-devel@mercurial-scm.org --flag evolve-ext --rev '&lt;your patches&gt;'For guidelines on the patch description, see the `official Mercurial guideline`_... _`official Mercurial guideline`: https://mercurial-scm.org/wiki/ContributingChanges#Patch_descriptionsPlease don't forget to update and run the tests when you fix a bug or add afeature. To run the tests, you need a working copy of Mercurial, say in$HGSRC::    $ cd tests    $ python $HGSRC/tests/run-tests.pyWhen certain blocks of code need to cope with API changes in core Mercurial,they should have comments in the ``hg &lt;= x.y (commit hash)`` format. Forexample, if a function needs another code path because of changes introduced in02802fa87b74 that was first included in Mercurial 5.3, then the comment shouldbe::    # hg &lt;= 5.2 (02802fa87b74)See also tests/test-check-compat-strings.t.Branch policy-------------The evolve tests are highly impacted by changes in core Mercurial. To deal withthis, we use named branches.There are two main branches: &quot;stable&quot; and &quot;default&quot;. Tests on these branchesare supposed to pass with the corresponding &quot;default&quot; and &quot;stable&quot; branch fromcore Mercurial. The documentation is built from the tip of stable.In addition, we have compatibility branches to check tests on older versions ofMercurial. They are the &quot;mercurial-x.y&quot; branches. They are used to applyexpected test changes only, no code changes should happen there.Test output changes from a changeset in core should add the following line totheir patch description::    CORE-TEST-OUTPUT-UPDATE: &lt;changeset hash&gt;Format-source config====================Format-source helps smooth out the pain of merging after auto-formatting.Follow the installation instructions at the `format-source`_ repo... _`format-source`: https://foss.heptapod.net/mercurial/format-sourceThen update your per-repo config file::    $ hg config --local --edit # add these lines:    [extensions]    formatsource =    [format-source]    byteify-strings = python3 ~/hg/contrib/byteify-strings.py --dictiter --treat-as-kwargs kwargs opts commitopts TROUBLES --allow-attr-methods    byteify-strings:mode.input = file    byteify-strings:mode.output = pipeRelease Checklist=================* use contrib/merge-test-compat.sh to merge with the test compatibility  branches,* make sure the tests are happy on all supported versions,* make sure there is no code difference between the compatibility branches and  stable (no diff within hgext3rd/),* update the ``testedwith`` variable for all extensions (remove '.dev0'):  - hgext3rd/evolve/metadata.py  - hgext3rd/topic/__init__.py  - hgext3rd/pullbundle.py* make sure CHANGELOG is up-to-date,* add a date to the CHANGELOG entry for the target version,* update the ``__version__`` field of all relevant extensions:  - hgext3rd/evolve/metadata.py  - hgext3rd/topic/__init__.py  - hgext3rd/pullbundle.py (if touched)* create a new Debian changelog entry:  - debchange --newversion x.y.z-1 &quot;new upstream release&quot;  - debchange --release* sanity check install and sdist targets of setup.py:  - python setup.py install --home=$(mktemp -d)  - python setup.py sdist* tag the commit,* move ``@`` bookmark to the new tag,* push and publish the tag,* upload the tarball to PyPI,* build .deb on Heptapod CI for the tagged commit,* make an announcement on evolve-testers@mercurial-scm.org and  mercurial@mercurial-scm.org,* bump versions of all extensions and add ``.dev0`` (see existing commits as an  example):  - hgext3rd/evolve/metadata.py  - hgext3rd/topic/__init__.py  - hgext3rd/pullbundle.py  Version bump rules:  - stable branch x.y.z+1.dev0  - default branch x.y+1.0.dev0* merge stable into default.</longdescription>

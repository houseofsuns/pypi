	<longdescription># amxtelnet### amx telnet functions## Telnet():#### Handles the actual telnet connection and communication with the AMX devices. This class is very universal, but if you run into issues using it on a non-AMX device, it may be caused by the modifications I had to make for AMX:##### Using the default telnetlib.py with AMX was causing an infinite handshake loop.##### _write() lines 269, 270 disabled IAC (telnet negotiation) doubling.##### process_rawq() lines 373, 374 changed when raw chars go to buf when IAC.## AMXConnect():### returns:#### commands are send to AMX masters. If desired, replies are written to file as .txt and/or logged.### set_systems():#### list of dicts where each dict is an AMX system.#### minimum key requirements:##### 'full_name' (string)##### 'master_ip' (string)##### 'master_model' (string) (NX-1200, NI-700, etc.)### config():#### user_name: user name to login to AMX#### password: password to login to AMX#### alt_username: user name to use if user_name fails#### alt_password: password to use with alt_user_name#### write_results: True or False; write replies to individual .txt files per system.#### output_path: file path to use if write_results is True. This path should also be used for the path in ParseAMXResponse().#### set_requests(): list of strings to send to the AMX master. $0D is automaticallyv appended.#### run(): Begin connecting to systems in set_systems(), sending requests from set_requests(), using settings from config()## ParseAMXResponse():#### Use this class to parse the information gathered from AMXConnect().#### This class is less universal in that it expects the .txt files to contain responses to the following commands in the following order:##### 'show device','get ip','program info','list'#### You can append additional commands as needed. The output of ParseAMXResponse().read_telnet_text() is a list of amx system dicts. Current uses of this list:##### export to excel using amxtoexcel.py to archive campus system status##### code creation using code_creator_django.py or code_creator_usm.py#### AMXConnect.path and ParseAMXResponse.path will normally refer to the same location. If you use the default locations in each class, they'll work together using systems/telnet responses/.#### If there's already .txt files in 'path' you can skip AMXConnect() and go straight to ParseAMXResponse() if using potentially outdated information is acceptable.</longdescription>

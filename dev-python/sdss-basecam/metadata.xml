The main benefits of using `basecam` are:- Simplifies the creation of production-level camera libraries by providing all the common boilerplate so that you only need to focus on implementing the parts that are specific to your camera API.- Provides a common API regardless of the underlying camera being handled.- Powerful event handling and notification.</longdescription>

	<longdescription># NAAS-PYTHON-KAFKAThis is the Kafka adapter for Python: it allows you to easily connect Python services to Apache Kafka via Python.The implementation is a wrapper around [Confluent-Kafka-Python](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-python):- AVRO schema's and messages: both key's and values should have a schema.as explained [here](https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/avro-schemas).- Kafka consumer and producer for the test-bed topics.- Management  - Heartbeat (topic: system-heartbeat), so you know which clients are online.  Each time the test-bed-adapter is executed, it starts a heartbeat process to notify  the its activity to other clients.## InstallationYou need to install [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/).To run the examples you will need to install the dependencies specified on the file [requirements.txt](https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/python-test-bed-adapter/blob/master/requirements.txt).For that, run```bashpython3 -m venv .venvsource .venv/bin/activatepip install -r requirements.txt # Or instead of `pip`, use `pip3````from the project folder.## Examples and usage- url_producer: creates a message with 4 URLs to RSS feeds on the topic ('system_rss_urls')- rss_producer: listens to url messages ('system_rss_urls') and produces RSS messages ('system_rss_urls')- rss_consumer: listens to RSS messages ('system_rss_urls') and prints them to console.## Uploading to PyPi1. Ensure you have the necessary tools installed: Make sure you have `setuptools` and `wheel` installed. You can install them using `pip`:```bash# Build the distribution files: In the root directory of your project, run the following command to build the distribution files (wheel and source distribution):pip install setuptools wheel```2. Build the distribution files: In the root directory of your project, run the following command to build the distribution files (wheel and source distribution):```bash# This command will generate the distribution files inside the dist directory.python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel```This command will generate the distribution files inside the dist directory.3. Register an account on PyPI: If you haven't done so already, create an account on PyPI and verify your email address.4. Install and configure `twine`: Install `twine`, a tool used to upload packages to PyPI, using `pip`:```bash# Upload the package to PyPI: Use twine to upload the distribution files to PyPI:pip install twine```1. Upload the package to PyPI: Use twine to upload the distribution files to PyPI:```bash# This command will prompt you to enter your PyPI username and password. Once provided, twine will upload the distribution files to PyPI.twine upload dist/*```This command will prompt you to enter your PyPI username and password. Once provided, twine will upload the distribution files to PyPI.1. Verify the package on PyPI: Visit your package page on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/osint-python-test-bed-adapter/) to ensure that the package has been successfully uploaded and published.Remember to update the version number in your `setup.py` file for each new release to avoid conflicts.</longdescription>

	<longdescription># config2pySimplified reading and writing configurations from various sources and formats.To install:```pip install config2py```[Documentation](https://i2mint.github.io/config2py/)Illustrative example:```pythonfrom config2py import get_config, user_gettablefrom dol import TextFilesimport osmy_configs = TextFiles('~/.my_configs/')  # Note, to run this, you'd need to have such a directory!# (But you can also use my_configs = dict() if you want.)config_getter = get_config(sources=[locals(), os.environ, my_configs, user_gettable(my_configs)])```Now let's see what happens when we do:```pythonconfig_getter('SOME_CONFIG_KEY')```Well, it will first look in `locals()`, which is a dictionary containing local variables(this could happen, for example, if we're in a function and want to first see if there was an argument where we could find that value).Assuming it doesn't find such a key in `locals()` it goes on to try to find it in `os.environ`, which is a dict containing system environment variables. Assuming it doesn't find it there either (that is, doesn't find a file with that name in the directory `~/.my_configs/`), it will prompt the user to enter the value of that key.The function finally returns with the value that the user entered.But there's more!Now look at what's in my_configs! If you've used `TextFiles`, look in the folder to see that there's a new file.Either way, if you do:```pythonmy_configs['SOME_CONFIG_KEY']```You'll now see the value the user entered.This means what? This means that the next time you try to get the config:```pythonconfig_getter('SOME_CONFIG_KEY')```It will return the value that the user entered last time, without prompting the user again.# A few notable tools you can import from `config2py`* `get_config`: Get a config value from a list of sources. See more below.* `user_gettable`: Create a ``GettableContainer`` that asks the user for a value, optionally saving it.* `ask_user_for_input`: Ask the user for input, optionally masking, validating and transforming the input.* `get_app_data_folder`: Returns the full path of a directory suitable for storing application-specific data.* `get_configs_local_store`: Get a local store (mapping interface of local files) of configs for a given app or package name* `configs`: A default local store (mapping interface of local files) for configs.## get_configGet a config value from a list of sources.This function acts as a mini-framework to construct config accessors including defining multiple sources of where to find these configs, A source can be a function or a ``GettableContainer``.(A ``GettableContainer`` is anything that can be indexed with brackets: ``obj[k]``,like ``dict``, ``list``, ``str``, etc..).Let's take two sources: a ``dict`` and a ``Callable``.    &gt;&gt;&gt; def func(k):    ...     if k == 'foo':    ...         return 'quux'    ...     elif k == 'green':    ...         return 'eggs'    ...     else:    ...         raise RuntimeError(f&quot;I don't handle that: {k}&quot;)    &gt;&gt;&gt; dict_ = {'foo': 'bar', 'baz': 'qux'}    &gt;&gt;&gt; sources = [func, dict_]See that ``get_config`` go through the sources in the order they were listed,and returns the first value it finds (or manages to compute) for the key:``get_config`` finds ``'foo'`` in the very first source (``func``):    &gt;&gt;&gt; get_config('foo', sources)    'quux'But ``baz`` makes ``func`` raise an error, so it goes to the next source: ``dict_``.There, it finds ``'baz'`` and returns its value:    &gt;&gt;&gt; get_config('baz', sources)    'qux'On the other hand, no one manages to find a config value for ``'no_a_key'``, so``get_config`` raises an error:    &gt;&gt;&gt; get_config('no_a_key', sources)    Traceback (most recent call last):    ...    config2py.errors.ConfigNotFound: Could not find config for key: no_a_keyBut if you provide a default value, it will return that instead:    &gt;&gt;&gt; get_config('no_a_key', sources, default='default')    'default'You can also provide a function that will be called on the value before it isreturned. This is useful if you want to do some post-processing on the value,or if you want to make sure that the value is of a certain type:This &quot;search the next source if the previous one fails&quot; behavior may not be whatyou want in some situations, since you'd be hiding some errors that you mightwant to be aware of. This is why allow you to specify what exceptions shouldactually be considered as &quot;config not found&quot; exceptions, through the``config_not_found_exceptions`` argument, which defaults to ``Exception``.Further, your sources may return a value, but not one that you consider valid:For example, a sentinel like ``None``. In this case you may want the search tocontinue. This is what the ``val_is_valid`` argument is for. It is a functionthat takes a value and returns a boolean. If it returns ``False``, the searchwill continue. If it returns ``True``, the search will stop and the value willbe returned.Finally, we have ``egress : Callable[[KT, TT], VT]``.This is a function that takes a key and a value, andreturns a value. It is called after the value has been found, and its returnvalue is the one that is returned by ``get_config``. This is useful if you wantto do some post-processing on the value, or before you return the value, or if youwant to do some caching.    &gt;&gt;&gt; config_store = dict()    &gt;&gt;&gt; def store_before_returning(k, v):    ...    config_store[k] = v    ...    return v    &gt;&gt;&gt; get_config('foo', sources, egress=store_before_returning)    'quux'    &gt;&gt;&gt; config_store    {'foo': 'quux'}    Note that a source can be a callable or a ``GettableContainer`` (most of the    time, a ``Mapping`` (e.g. ``dict``)).    Here, you should be compelled to use the resources of ``dol``    (https://pypi.org/project/dol/) which will allow you to make ``Mapping``s for all    sorts of data sources.For more info, see: https://github.com/i2mint/config2py/issues/4</longdescription>

	<longdescription>Flake8-For-Pycharm==================This is a plugin for Flake8 that will emulate pylint json output.Installation------------.. code-block:: bash    pip install flake8-for-pycharmflake8 will be automaitcally installed in the same enviroment.To validate installation run `flake8_pycharm.py --help-msg=E1101`.Output should look like that:.. code-block::    :no-member (E1101): *%s %r has no %r member%s*    Used when a variable is accessed for an unexistent member. This message    belongs to the typecheck checker.pylint will also be installed because pycharm plugin refuses to work if it's not installed.Usage-----1. Locate the file `flake8_pycharm.py` in your python environment (in linux use command `which flake8_pycharm.py`)2. In Pycharm go to File -&gt; Settings -&gt; Pylint (If you can't find it, go to Settings -&gt; Plugins and install pylint plugin)3. In &quot;Path to Pylint executable&quot;, provide path to &quot;flake8_pycharm.py&quot; script4. [ *Optional* ] In path to pylintrc, provide path to your flake8 configuration file5. Do not put anything in the &quot;Arguments&quot; field or script won't work.6. This is it, youa re basically done.Pylint support--------------If you want support for both pylint and flake8, you'll need to add `--with-pylint` parameter.In PyCharm, add this value in the `Arguments` field in pylint settings page.How does it work?-----------------Initially Pycharm call pylint with the following arguments.. code-block:: bash    pylint --help-msg=E1101Once this command has succeeded, it assumes that pylint is installed and starts using it with command like that... code-block:: bash    pylint --rcfile=pylintrc -f json my_file.pyThe `flake8_pycharm.py` script understand those pylint arguments,query flake8 accordingly and return result in same format that pylint produces.Troubleshooting---------------If you did everything correctly but pycharm kept complaining about pylint being not installed, you might have to install it anyway.It's a bug reported by a colleague but I wasn't able to reproduce it locallay.If you received errors from pycharm, you can try to run the command manually to see if it's producing errors... code-block:: bash    flake8_pycharm.py --rcfile=&lt;your flake8 configuration&gt; -f json my_file.py</longdescription>

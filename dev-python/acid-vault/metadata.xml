	<longdescription># Python password vault.Python password vault to keep track of password either locally or centralized in your own cloud.As this is a hobby project I cannot guarantee any functionality or that no data loss will occur, but as I use it personally I will do my best to avoid it.Currently development is done on Python 3.9 and the client runs on Win10 while the cloud is run on Raspbian on a Raspberry Pi 2.**Prerequisites**- cryptography- paramiko- pillow**Setup**- Install prerequisites- Clone repo or pip install acid_vault- Run VaultGui.pyw (For GUI)- Setup your vault in file menu (Only necessary for Cloud and/or Steganography)  - Setup SSH for cloud (For remote storage of vault)    - Host - URL to host    - Port - Port to use on host    - Username - Username to login with at host    - Password - Password to login with at host, will not be saved and has to be entered each time program is started. Recomended usage is through key exchange, see below  - Setup Steganography (For hiding the vault in an image)    - File location - path to vault storage E.g. images/picture.png    - Original file - path to local file with the original png picture to compare against (Important that its a png and not jpeg as jpeg compression is not stable)- Check [Steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography) (If Steganography is to be used)- Chose Local/Remote (Where to store vault)**Basic usage**- Add passwords by pressing &quot;Add Password&quot; button.- Chose a password in password box.- Press Save passwords to save passwords in vault.- Press Load passwords to load passwords into vault (Will clear any unsaved data).- Lock/Unlock - Will lock/unlock the data kept by program while its running to avoid overhead of getting data from the cloud.If vault detect that the user has not used the UI for 5 minutes it will lock itself.The file menu has options to save/load backups both as encrypted and unencrypted locally where the user chose.</longdescription>

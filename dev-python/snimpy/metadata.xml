Here is a very simplistic example that allows us todisplay the routing table of a given host::    load(&quot;IP-FORWARD-MIB&quot;)    m=M(&quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;public&quot;, 2)    routes = m.ipCidrRouteNextHop    for x in routes:        net, netmask, tos, src = x        print(&quot;%15s/%-15s via %-15s src %-15s&quot; % (net, netmask, routes[x], src))You can either use *Snimpy* interactively throught its console(derived from Python own console or from IPython_ if available) orwrite *Snimpy* scripts which are just Python scripts with some globalvariables available... _IPython: http://ipython.org* Free software: ISC license* Documentation: http://snimpy.rtfd.org.*Snimpy* requires libsmi_ to work correctly. See the documentation formore information... _libsmi: https://www.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/projects/libsmi/Features--------*Snimpy* is aimed at being the more Pythonic possible. You should forgetthat you are doing SNMP requests. *Snimpy* will rely on MIB to hide SNMPdetails. Here are some &quot;features&quot;:* MIB parser based on libsmi  (through CFFI)* SNMP requests are handled by PySNMP (SNMPv1, SNMPv2 and SNMPv3  support)* scalars are just attributes of your session object* columns are like a Python dictionary and made available as an  attribute* getting an attribute is like issuing a GET method* setting an attribute is like issuing a SET method* iterating over a table is like using GETNEXT* when something goes wrong, you get an exceptionHistory-------1.0.0 (2021-05-29)++++++++++++++++++* Drop compatibility with Python 2.0.8.14 (2020-04-26)+++++++++++++++++++* Add ``items()`` in addition to ``iteritems()`` This is an iterator  on Python 3 and return a list of items in Python 2.0.8.13 (2018-10-12)+++++++++++++++++++* Compatibility with Python 3.7.* Fix an issue with implied index when reusing indexes between tables.0.8.12 (2017-10-02)+++++++++++++++++++* Support for more recent versions of IPython.* Support for SNMPv3 context name.* Support for notification nodes (MIB only).0.8.11 (2016-08-13)+++++++++++++++++++* Fix IPython interactive shell.* Fix IPv6 handling for sessions.* Ability for a session to return None instead of raising an exception.0.8.10 (2016-02-16)+++++++++++++++++++* Ability to walk a table (if the first index is accessible).* Ability to do a partial walk (courtesy of Alex Unigovsky).0.8.8 (2015-11-15)++++++++++++++++++* Fix thread-safety problem introduced in 0.8.6. This also undo any  improvement advertised in 0.8.6 when using multiple  threads. However, performance should be kept when using a single  thread.0.8.7 (2015-11-14)++++++++++++++++++* Ability to specify a module name when querying a manager.* Compatibility with PySNMP 4.3* Array-like interface for OIDs.* Ability to restrict lookups to a specific MIB: m['IF-MIB'].ifDescr.* Fix multithread support with SNMPv3 (with a performance impact).0.8.6 (2015-06-24)++++++++++++++++++* Major speed improvement.* Major memory usage improvement.0.8.5 (2015-04-04)++++++++++++++++++* Ability to set SMI search path (with ``mib.path()``)* Fix documentation build on *Read the Doc*.* Add a loose mode to manager to loosen type coercion.0.8.4 (2015-02-10)++++++++++++++++++* More CFFI workarounds, including cross-compilation support.* Ability to override a node type.* Automatic workaround for &quot;SNMP too big&quot; error message.0.8.3 (2014-08-18)++++++++++++++++++* IPv6 support.0.8.2 (2014-06-08)++++++++++++++++++* Minor bugfixes.0.8.1 (2013-10-25)++++++++++++++++++* Workaround a problem with CFFI extension installation.0.8.0 (2013-10-19)++++++++++++++++++++* Python 3.3 support. Pypy support.* PEP8 compliant.* Sphinx documentation.* Octet strings with a display hint are now treated differently than  plain octet strings (unicode). Notably, they can now be set using  the displayed format (for example, for MAC addresses).0.7.0 (2013-09-23)++++++++++++++++++* Major rewrite.* SNMP support is now provided through PySNMP_.* MIB parsing is still done with ``libsmi`` but through CFFI instead of a  C module.* More unittests. Many bugfixes... _PySNMP: http://pysnmp.sourceforge.net/0.6.4 (2013-03-21)++++++++++++++++++* GETBULK support.* MacAddress SMI type support.0.6.3 (2012-04-13)++++++++++++++++++* Support for IPython 0.12.* Minor bugfixes.0.6.2 (2012-01-19)++++++++++++++++++* Ability to return None instead of getting an exception.0.6.1 (2012-01-14)++++++++++++++++++* Thread safety and efficiency.0.6 (2012-01-10)++++++++++++++++++* SNMPv3 support0.5.1 (2011-08-07)++++++++++++++++++* Compatibility with IPython 0.11.* Custom timeouts and retries.0.5 (2010-02-03)++++++++++++++++++* Check conformity of loaded modules.* Many bugfixes.0.4 (2009-06-06)++++++++++++++++++* Allow to cache requests.0.3 (2008-11-23)++++++++++++++++++* Provide a manual page.* Use a context manager to group SET requests.0.2.1 (2008-09-28)++++++++++++++++++* First release on PyPI.</longdescription>

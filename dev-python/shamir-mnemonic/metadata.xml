	<longdescription>python-shamir-mnemonic======================.. image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/shamir-mnemonic.svg    :target: https://badge.fury.io/py/shamir-mnemonicReference implementation of SLIP-0039: Shamir's Secret-Sharing for MnemonicCodesAbstract--------This SLIP describes a standard and interoperable implementation of Shamir'ssecret sharing (SSS). SSS splits a secret into unique parts which can bedistributed among participants, and requires a specified minimum number ofparts to be supplied in order to reconstruct the original secret. Knowledge offewer than the required number of parts does not leak information about thesecret.Specification-------------See https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0039.md for fullspecification.Security--------This implementation is not using any hardening techniques. Secrets are passed in theopen, and calculations are most likely trivially vulnerable to side-channel attacks.The purpose of this code is to verify correctness of other implementations. **It shouldnot be used for handling sensitive secrets**.Installation------------With pip from GitHub:.. code-block:: console    $ pip3 install shamir-mnemonicFrom local checkout for development:.. code-block:: console    $ python3 setup.py developCLI usage---------CLI tool is included as a reference and UX testbed.**Warning:** this tool makes no attempt to protect sensitive data! Use at your own risk.If you need this to recover your wallet seeds, make sure to do it on an air-gappedcomputer, preferably running a live system such as Tails.When the :code:`shamir_mnemonic` package is installed, you can use the :code:`shamir`command:.. code-block:: console    $ shamir create 3of5   # create a 3-of-5 set of shares    $ shamir recover       # interactively recombine shares to get the master secretYou can supply your own master secret as a hexadecimal string:.. code-block:: console    $ shamir create 3of5 --master-secret=cb21904441dfd01a392701ecdc25d61cYou can specify a custom scheme. For example, to create three groups, with 2-of-3,2-of-5, and 4-of-5, and require completion of all three groups, use:.. code-block:: console    $ shamir create custom --group-threshold 3 --group 2 3 --group 2 5 --group 4 5Use :code:`shamir --help` or :code:`shamir create --help` to see all available options.If you want to run the CLI from a local checkout without installing, use the followingcommand:.. code-block:: console    $ python3 -m shamir_mnemonic.cliTest vectors------------The test vectors in vectors.json are given as a list of triples. The first member of thetriple is a description of the test vector, the second member is a list of mnemonics andthe third member is the master secret which results from combining the mnemonics. Themaster secret is encoded as a string containing two hexadecimal digits for each byte. Ifthe string is empty, then attempting to combine the given set of mnemonics should resultin error. The passphrase &quot;TREZOR&quot; is used for all valid sets of mnemonics.Changelog=========.. default-role:: codeAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.The format is based on `Keep a Changelog`_, and this project adheres to`Semantic Versioning`_.`Unreleased`_-------------No changes yet.. _Unreleased: https://github.com/trezor/python-shamir-mnemonic/compare/v0.2.2...HEAD`0.2.2`_ - 2021-12-07---------------------Changed~~~~~~~- Relaxed Click constraint so that Click 8.x is allowed- Applied `black` and `flake8` code style.. _0.2.2: https://github.com/trezor/python-shamir-mnemonic/compare/v0.2.1...v0.2.2`0.2.1`_ - 2021-02-03---------------------.. _0.2.1: https://github.com/trezor/python-shamir-mnemonic/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.1Fixed~~~~~- Re-released on the correct commit`0.2.0`_ - 2021-02-03---------------------.. _0.2.0: https://github.com/trezor/python-shamir-mnemonic/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0Added~~~~~- Introduce `slip_ems` and `recover_ems` to separate password-based encryption from the Shamir Secret recovery- Introduce classes representing a share and group-common parameters- Introduce `RecoveryState` class that allows reusing the logic of the `shamir recover` commandChanged~~~~~~~- Use `secrets` module instead of `os.urandom`- Refactor and restructure code into separate modules0.1.0 - 2019-07-19------------------Added~~~~~- Initial implementation.. _Keep a Changelog: https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/.. _Semantic Versioning: https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html</longdescription>

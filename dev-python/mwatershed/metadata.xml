Note `seeds.shape` must be equal to `affinities.shape[1:]`. Any entry not equal to 0 is guaranteed to stay that way, any entry equal to zero has no priors.* `edges` is a list of `(u, v, aff)` tuples to insert arbitrary extra affinities between fragment ids### CreditsThis package was created with [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) and the [`pattonw/cookiecutter-rust-pypackage`](https://github.com/pattonw/cookiecutter-rust-pypackage) project template.</longdescription>

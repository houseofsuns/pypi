	<longdescription>IDSPy_Dictionaries==================IMAS Data Dictionaries converted to Python Dataclass used in the  IDSPy suite.Prerequisites=============To use this script, you need to have Python **3.9** or later installed. You can download Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/.Please note that Python at least **3.10** is recommended.Installation============To install the necessary packages, run the following command:.. code-block:: console   python -m pip install idspy_dictionariesUsage=====To load the desired IDS :.. code-block:: python   from idspy_dictionaries import ids_gyrokinetics # or any other available IDS   new_ids = ids_gyrokinetics.Gyrokinetics()FAQ===**Q:** What is the minimum required version of Python to run this script?  **A:** The  recommended version of Python is 3.10. It can be used with Python &gt;= 3.9          but there is no support in that case.**Q:** Can I add new members to the dataclasses?  **A:** This option is not possible to be sure that the dataclasses follow the IMAS conventions.**Q:** Is the package compatible with pydantic and/or attrs?  **A:** Short answer, no ;)**Q:** I would really like to use python &lt;3.9 is it really impossible?  **A:** IDSPy_dictionaries used mainly python dataclasses and the slot property which had been added in python 3.10 only.         The main reason to use __slots__ is to avoid addition of members in the IDS and remains fully compliant with IMAS.         A version of the package had been published &quot;as it is&quot; without the slots dependency but need at least python 3.9.         The way dataclasses are generated with the associated fields, at the opposite, is not compatible at all with python 3.8.**Q:** Can I load all the dictionaries at once?  **A:** For performances reasons, it's not possible right now.</longdescription>

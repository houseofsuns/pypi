An additional phase offset &lt;code&gt;&amp;straightphi;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt; may be set,    e.g. to let the fringe patterns start with a gray value of zero.    There can be `K` sets, with `K` being the number of fringe patterns    with different spatial frequency &lt;code&gt;v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;i &amp;isin; {&amp;Nopf;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; | i &lt; K}&lt;/code&gt;.  - #### Temporal Modulation    &lt;code&gt;I = A + B cos(2&amp;pi;v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;x - 2&amp;pi;f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;t - &amp;straightphi;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;        The patterns are then shifted &lt;code&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt; times    with an equidistant phase shift of &lt;code&gt;2&amp;pi;f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.    This is equal to sampling over &lt;code&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt; periods    with &lt;code&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; sample points    at time steps &lt;code&gt;t = n / N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;n &amp;isin; {&amp;Nopf;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; | n &lt; N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;.- #### Decoding  - #### Temporal Demodulation    &lt;code&gt;&amp;straightphi;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;equiv; &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; mod 2&amp;pi;&lt;/code&gt;\    &lt;code&gt;&amp;xi; &amp;equiv; &amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;straightphi;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;/(2&amp;pi;) mod &amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;\    From these shifts, the phase maps &lt;code&gt;&amp;straightphi;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt; are determined [[3]](#3).    Due to the trigonometric functions used,    the global phase &lt;code&gt;&amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = 2&amp;pi;v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;x - &amp;straightphi;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;    is wrapped into the interval &lt;code&gt;[0, 2 &amp;pi;]&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt; periods.    - #### Spatial Demodulation (Phase Unwrapping)      To obtain the encoded coordinate &lt;code&gt;&amp;xi;&lt;/code&gt;, three tasks must be executed:      1. Undo the spatial modulation         by finding the correct period order number         &lt;code&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;isin; {&amp;Nopf;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; | k&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; &amp;lceil;v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;rceil;}&lt;/code&gt; for each set `i`.         The global phase is then estimated to be &lt;code&gt;&amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = k&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; 2&amp;pi; + &amp;straightphi;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;\.      2. Recover the common independent variables, i.e. the coordinates &lt;code&gt;&amp;xi;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;,         by linearly rescaling the global phase map:          &lt;code&gt;&amp;xi;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = L&amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; / 2&amp;pi;&lt;/code&gt;,         with `L` being the pattern length (in pixel).      3. Fuse the K coordinate maps by weighted averaging:         &lt;code&gt;&amp;xi; = &amp;sum;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;xi;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; / &amp;sum;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.         To obtain an optimal estimate, use inverse variance weighting,        i.e. use the inverse variances of the coordinate maps as the weights for averaging:         &lt;code&gt;w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 / &amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;&amp;straightphi;,i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/code&gt;,         with &lt;code&gt;&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;&amp;straightphi;,i&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;prop; B&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; / v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; / &amp;radic;N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;         [[4]](#4).            This constitutes the registration, which is a mapping in the same pixel grid as the camera sensor      and contains the information where each camera pixel, i.e. each camera sightray, was looking at      during the fringe pattern acquisition.      Note that in contrast to binary coding schemes, e.g. Gray code,      the coordinate is obtained with sub-pixel precision.            - #### No Unwrapping        If only one set `K = 1` with spatial frequency &lt;code&gt;v &amp;le; 1&lt;/code&gt; is used,        no unwrapping is required because one period covers the complete coding range.        In this case, only the scaling part has to be executed.      - #### Temporal Phase Unwrapping (TPU)        If multiple sets with different spatial frequencies &lt;code&gt;v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt; are used        and the unambiguous measurement range is larger than the coding range, i.e. &lt;code&gt;UMR &amp;ge; L&lt;/code&gt;,        the ambiguity of the phase map is resolved by        generalized multi-frequency temporal phase unwrapping (GTPU).            - #### Spatial Phase Unwrapping (SPU)        However, if only one set with `v &gt; 1` is used, or multiple sets but  `UMR &lt; L`,        the ambiguous phase &lt;code&gt;&amp;straightphi;&lt;/code&gt; is unwrapped        analyzing the neighbouring phase values [[5]](#5), [[6]](#6).        This only yields a relative phase map, therefore absolute positions are unknown.            - #### Fourier-transform method (FTM)        In some cases, the phase signal introduced by the object's distortion of the fringe pattern        can be extracted with a purely spatial analysis by virtue of the Fourier-transform method [[7]](#7), [[8]](#8):        The recorded phase consists of a carrier with the spatial frequency `v'` and the signal        (please note that `v'` denotes the spatial frequency in the recorded (camera) frame,        therefore `v` and `v'` are related by the imaging of the optical system but not identical):        &lt;code&gt;&amp;phi; = &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; + &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = 2&amp;pi;v'x + &amp;straightphi;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.        If the offset `A`, the amplitude `B` anf the signal phase &lt;code&gt;&amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt; vary slowly        compared with the variation introduced by the spatial-carrier frequency `v'`,        i.e. the surface is rather smooth and has no sharp edges, and the spatial carrier frequency `v'` is high enough,        i.e. `v &gt;&gt; 1`, their spetra can be separated and therefore filtered in the frequency space.        For this purpose, the recorded fringe pattern is Fourier transformed        by the use of the two-dimensional fast-Fourier-transform (2DFFT) algorithm - hence the name -         and processed in its spatial frequency domain.        Here, the Fourier spectra are separated by the carrier frequency `v'`, cf. Figure 3.        We filter out the background variation `A`,        select either of the two spectra on the carrier,        and translate it by `v'` on the frequency axis toward the origin.        Again using the 2DFFT algorithm, we compute the inverse Fourier-transform.        Now we have the signal phase &lt;code&gt;&amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in the imaginary part        completely separated from the unwanted amplitude variation `B` in the real part.        Subsequently, a spatial phase-unwrapping algorithm may be deployed to remove any remaining phase jumps.        This phase unwrapping method is not critical        if the signal-to-noise ratio is higher than 10        and the gradients of the signal phase &lt;code&gt;&amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt; are less than &lt;code&gt;&amp;pi;&lt;/code&gt; per pixel.        Again, this only yields a relative phase map, therefore absolute positions are unknown.                &lt;img src=&quot;docs/readme/FTM.png&quot; width=&quot;320&quot;/&gt;\        Figure 3: From [[7]](#7). In this image, the spatial frequency is denotes as f. (A) Separated Fourier spectra;        (B) single spectrum selected and translated to the origin. ---&gt;&lt;!---In an alternative formulation, the absolute quantities offset `A` and amplitude `B`are replaced by the maximal possible gray value `Imax`and the relative quantities exposure (relative average intensity) `β` and visibilty (relative fringe contrast) `V`[[9]](#9):```I = A + B * cos(Φ) = Imax * β * (1 + V * cos(Φ))```The two parameters `β` and `V` describe the phase shifting signal `I`independently of the value range of the light source or camera.Both lie within the interval `[0, 1]` with the additional condition &lt;code&gt;β &amp;le; 1 / (1 + V)&lt;/code&gt;;else, the radiance of the light source would be higher than the maximal possible value `Imax`.Therefore, the valid values are limited for &lt;code&gt;β &amp;ge; 0.5 &lt;/code&gt;.The optimal fringe contrast is achieved for `β = 0.5` and `V = 1`. &lt;img src=&quot;docs/readme/codomain.png&quot; width=&quot;480&quot;/&gt;\Figure 2: Fringe pattern as a function of `β` and `V`.The advantage of this representation is the normalization of the descriptive parameters `β` and `V`and thereby the separation of additive and multiplicative influences.The exposure `β` is affected by additional, constant light (not modulating the signal):- the maximum brightness of the light source,- the exposure time and the aperture setting of the camera,- the absorption of optical elements (e.g. filters).The visibility `V` of the fringes is influenced by:- the maximum contrast of the light source,- the modulation transfer function of the optical elements (e.g. the scattering characteristics of the test object),- the depth of field and defocus,- the resolution of the camera(the camera pixel size projected onto the light source acts as a low pass filter, reducing the modulation of the signal).---&gt;&lt;!---## Contents- [Installation](#installation)- [Usage](#usage)- [Graphical User Interface](#graphical-user-interface)- [Optimal Coding Strategy](#optimal-coding-strategy)- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)- [License](#license)- [Project Status](#project-status)- [References](#references)---&gt;## InstallationYou can install `fringes` directly from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) via `pip`:```pip install fringes```## UsageYou instantiate, parameterize and deploy the `Fringes` class:```pythonimport fringes as frng  # import modulef = frng.Fringes()      # instantiate classf.glossary              # get glossaryf.X = 1920              # set width of the fringe patternsf.Y = 1080              # set height of the fringe patternsf.K = 2                 # set number of setsf.N = 4                 # set number of shiftsf.v = [9, 10]           # set spatial frequenciesf.T                     # get number of frames                            I = f.encode()          # encode fringe patternsA, B, x = f.decode(I)   # decode fringe patterns```&lt;!---f.logger.setLevel(&quot;DEBUG&quot;)  # set logging levelYou can change the [logging level](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#levels) of a `Fringes` instance.For example, changing it to `'DEBUG'` gives you verbose feedback on which parameters are changedand how long functions take to execute.All parameters are accesible by the respective attributes of the `Fringes` instance(a glossary of them is obtained by the class attribute `glossary`).---&gt;All parameters are accesible by the respective attributes of the `Fringes` instance(a glossary of them is obtained by the attribute `glossary`).They are implemented as class properties (managed attributes).Note that some attributes have subdependencies, hence dependent attributes might change as well.Circular dependencies are resolved automatically.&lt;!---They are implemented as class properties (managed attributes), which are parsed when setting,so usually several input types are accepted(e.g. `bool`, `int`, `float` for scalarsand additionally `list`, `tuple`, `ndarray` for arrays).Note that some attributes have subdependencies (cf. Figure 3) , hence dependent attributes might change as well.Circular dependencies are resolved automatically.---&gt;For generating the fringe pattern sequence `I`, use the method `encode()`.\It returns a [NumPy array](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) in videoshape (frames `T`, width `X`, height `Y`, color channels `C`).For analyzing (recorded) fringe patterns, use the method `decode()`.\It returns the Numpy arrays brightness `A`, modulation `B` and coordinate `x`.&lt;!---For analyzing (recorded) fringe patterns, use the method `decode()`.It will return a [namedtuple](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple), containing the Numpy arrays brightness `A`, modulation `B` and the coordinates `ξ`,all in videoshape.&lt;img src=&quot;docs/readme/interdependencies.svg&quot; width=&quot;720&quot;/&gt;\Figure 3: Parameters and their Interdependencies.Each set (cf. frames in middle column in Figure 1)consists of the following attributes (cf. black box in Figure 3):- `N`: number of shifts- `l`: wavelength [px]- `v`: spatial frequency, i.e. number of periods (per screen length `L`)- `f`: temporal frequency, i.e. number of periods to shift overEach is an array with shape (number of directions `D`, number of sets `K`).\For example, if &lt;code&gt;N.shape &amp;equiv; (2, 3)&lt;/code&gt;, it means that we encode `D = 2` directions with `K = 3` sets each.Changing `D` or `K` directly, changes the shape of all set attributes.\When setting a set attribute with a new shape (`D'`, `K'`),`D` and `K` are updated as well as the shape of the other set attributes.\If a set attribute is 1D, then it is stacked to match the number of directions `D`.\If a set attribute is 0D i.e. a scalar, then all values are simply replaced by the new one.`l` and `v` are related by `l = L / v`.When `L` changes, `v` is kept constant and only `l` is changed.---&gt;## Graphical User InterfaceDo you need a GUI? `Fringes` has a sister project that is called `Fringes-GUI`: https://pypi.org/project/fringes-gui/&lt;!---## __Quality Metrics__`UMR` denotes the unambiguous measurement range.The coding is only unique within the interval `[0, UMR)`; after that it repeats itself.The `UMR` is derived from `l` and `v`:- If &lt;code&gt;l &amp;isin; &amp;Nopf;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;UMR = lcm(l&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; with `lcm` being the least common multiple.- Else, if &lt;code&gt;v &amp;isin; &amp;Nopf;&lt;/code&gt;,  &lt;code&gt;UMR = `L`/ gcd(v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; with `gcd` being the greatest common divisor.- Else, if &lt;code&gt;l &amp;and; v &amp;isin; &amp;#8474;&lt;/code&gt;, `lcm` resp. `gcd` are extended to rational numbers.- Else, if &lt;code&gt;l &amp;and; v &amp;isin; &amp;#8477; \ &amp;#8474;&lt;/code&gt;, `l` and `v` are approximated by rational numbers  with a fixed length of decimal digits.`eta` denotes the coding efficiency `L / UMR`. It makes no sense to choose `UMR` much larger than `L`,because then a significant part of the coding range is not used.`u` denotes the minimum possible uncertainty of the measurement in pixels.It is based on the phase noise model from [[4]](#4)and propagated through the unwrapping process and the phase fusion.It is influenced by the fringe attributes- `M`: number of averaged intensity samples,- `N`: number of phase shifts,- `l`: wavelengths of the fringes,- `B`: measured amplitudeand the measurement hardware-specific noise sources [[10]](#10), [[11]](#11)- `quant`: quantization noise of the light source or camera,- `dark`: dark noise of the used camera,- `shot`: photon noise of light itself,- `gain`: system gain of the used camera.`DR = UMR / u` is the dynamic range of the phase shift codingand is a measure of how many points can be distinguished within the unambiguous measurement range `[0, UMR)`.It remains constant if `L` and hence `l` are scaled (the scaling factor cancels out).`SNR = L / u` is the signal-to-noise ratio of the phase shift codingand is a masure of how many points can be distinguished within the screen length `[0, L)`.Again, it remains constant if `L` and hence `l` are scaled (the scaling factor cancels out).## __Optimal Coding Strategy__As makes sense intuitively, more sets `K` as well as more shifts `N` per set reduce the uncertainty `u` after decoding.A minimum of 3 shifts is needed to solve for the 3 unknowns brightness `A`, modulation `B` and coordinate `ξ`.Any additional 2 shifts compensate for one harmonic of the recorded fringe pattern.Therefore, higher accuracy can be achieved using more shifts `N`, but the time required to capture them sets a practical upper limit to the feasible number of shifts.Generally, shorter wavelengths `l` (or equivalently more periods `v`) reduce the uncertainty `u`,but the resolution of the camera and the display must resolve the fringe pattern spatially.Hence, the used hardware imposes a lower bound for the wavelength (or upper bound for the number of periods).   Also, small wavelengths might result in a smaller unambiguous measurement range `UMR`.If two or more sets `K` are used and their wavelengths `l` resp. number of periods `v` are relative primes,the unambiguous measurement range can be increased many times.As a consequence, one can use much smaller wavelenghts `l` (larger number of periods `v`).However, it must be assured that the unambiguous measurment range is always equal or larger than both,the width `X` and the height `Y`.Else, [temporal phase unwrapping](#temporal-phase-unwrapping--tpu-) would yield wrong results and thus instead[spatial phase unwrapping](#spatial-phase-unwrapping--spu-) is used.Be aware that in the latter case only a relative phase map is obtained,which lacks the information of where exactly the camera pixels were imaged to during acquisition.To simplify finding and setting the optimal parameters, one can choose from the followng options:- `v` can be set to `'optimal'`.  This automatically determines the optimal integer set of `v`,  based on the maximal resolvable spatial frequency `vmax`.\- Equivalently, `l` can also be set to `'optimal'`.  This will automatically determine the optimal integer set of `l`,  based on the minimal resolvable wavelength `lmin = L / vmax`.- `T` can be set directly, based on the desired acquisition time.  The optimal `K`, `N` and  - if necessary - the multiplexing methods will be determined automatically.- Instead of the options above, one can simply use the function `optimize()`  to automatically set the optimal `v`, `l`, `T` and multiplexing methods.However, those methods only perform optimallyif the recorded modulation `B` is known (or can be estimated) for each certain spatial frequencies `v`.1. Option A: Measure the **modulation transfer function (MTF)** at a given number of sample points:   1. Set `K` to the required number of sample ponts (usually 10 is a good value).   2. Set `v` to `'exponential'`.      This will create spatial frequencies `v` spaced evenly on a log scale (a geometric progression),      starting from `0` up to `vmax`.   3. Encode, acquire and decode the fringe pattern sequence.   4. Mask the values of `B` with nan where the camera wasn't looking at the screen.   5. Call `Bv(B)` with the estimated modulation from the measurement as the argument.   6. Finlly, to get the modulation `B` at certain spatial frequencies `v`, simply call `MTF(v)`.       This method interpolates the modulation from the measurements `Bv` at the points `v`.2. Option B: Estimate the **magnification** and the **Point Spread Function (PSF)** of the imaging system:   1. Set the attributes `magnification` and `PSF` of the `Fringes` instance.      `PSF` is given as the standard deviation of the Point Spread Function.   2. Finlly, to get the modulation `B` at certain spatial frequencies `v`, simply call `MTF(v)`.       This method computes the modulation from the specified attributes `magnifiction` and `PSF` directly.---&gt;## Troubleshooting&lt;!---- __`poetry install` does not work__    First, ensure that poetry is installed correctly as descibed on the [Poetry Website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).\  Secondly, ensure the correct python version is installed on your system, as specified in the file `pyproject.toml`!\  Thirdly, this can be caused by a proxy which `pip` does not handle correctly.  Manually setting the proxy in the Windows settings or even adding a system variable   `https_proxy = http://YOUR_PROXY:PORT` can resolve this.---&gt;- __Decoding takes a long time__    This is most likely due to the just-in-time compiler [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/),   which is used for this computationally expensive functions:  During the first execution, an initial compilation is executed.   This can take several tens of seconds up to single digit minutes, depending on your CPU.  However, for any subsequent execution, the compiled code is cached and the code of the function runs much faster,   approaching the speeds of code written in C.&lt;!---- __My decoded coordinates show lots of noise__  - Make sure the exposure of your camera is adjusted so that the fringe patterns show up with maximum contrast.    Try to avoid under- and overexposure during acquisition.  - Try using more, sets `K` and/or shifts `N`.  - Adjust the used wavelengths `l` resp. number of periods `v` to ensure the unamboguous measurement range    is larger than the pattern length, i.e. &lt;code&gt;UMR &amp;ge; L&lt;/code&gt;.  - If the decoded modulation is much lower than the decoded brightness,    try to use larger wavelengths `l` resp. smaller number of periods `v`.\    If the decoded modulation remains low even with very large wavelengths (less than five periods per screen length),    and you are conducting a deflectometric mesurement, the surface under test is probably too rough.    Since deflectometry is for specular and glossy surfaces only, it isn't suited for scattering ones.    You should consider a different measurement technique, e.g. fringe projection.- __My decoded coordinates show systematic offsets__  - First, ensure that the correct frames were captured while acquiring the fringe pattern sequence.    If the timings are not set correctly, the sequence may be a frame off.  - Secondly, this might occur if either the camera or the display used have a gamma value very different from 1.    - Typically, screens have a gamma value of 2.2; therefore compensate by setting the inverse value      &lt;code&gt;gamma&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 / 2.2 &amp;approx; 0.45&lt;/code&gt; to the `gamma` attribute of the `Fringes` instance.\      Alternatively, change the gamma value of the light source or camera directly.    - You can use the static method `gamma_auto_correct` to      automatically estimate and apply the gamma correction factor to linearize the display/camera response curve.    - You might also use more shifts `N` to compensate for the dominant harmonics of the gamma-nonlinearities.---&gt;## LicenseCreative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License## Project StatusThis package is under active development, so features and functionally will be added in the future.Feature requests are warmly welcomed!## References&lt;a id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;[Burke et al.,“Reverse engineering by fringe projection,”Interferometry XI: Applications,2002.](https://doi.org/10.1117/12.473547)&lt;a id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;[Burke et al.,&quot;Deflectometry for specular surfaces: an overview&quot;,Advanced Optical Technologies,2023.](https://doi.org/10.3389/aot.2023.1237687)&lt;a id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;[Burke,&quot;Phase Decoding and Reconstruction&quot;,Optical Methods for Solid Mechanics: A Full-Field Approach,2012.](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Optical+Methods+for+Solid+Mechanics%3A+A+Full+Field+Approach-p-9783527411115)&lt;a id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;[Surrel,&quot;Additive noise effect in digital phase detection&quot;,Applied Optics,1997.](https://doi.org/10.1364/AO.36.000271)&lt;a id=&quot;5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;[Herráez et al.,&quot;Fast two-dimensional phase-unwrapping algorithm based on sorting by reliability following a noncontinuous path&quot;,Applied Optics,2002.](https://doi.org/10.1364/AO.41.007437)&lt;a id=&quot;6&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;[Lei et al.,&quot;A novel algorithm based on histogram processing of reliability for two-dimensional phase unwrapping&quot;,Optik - International Journal for Light and Electron Optics,2015.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijleo.2015.04.070)&lt;a id=&quot;7&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;[Takeda et al.,&quot;Fourier-transform method of fringe-pattern analysis for computer-based topography and interferometry&quot;,Journal of the Optical Society of America,1982.](https://doi.org/10.1364/JOSA.72.000156)&lt;a id=&quot;8&quot;&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;[Massig and Heppner,&quot;Fringe-pattern analysis with high accuracy by use of the Fourier-transform method: theory and experimental tests&quot;,Applied Optocs,2001.](https://doi.org/10.1364/AO.40.002081)&lt;a id=&quot;9&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt;[Fischer et al.,&quot;Vorhersage des Phasenrauschens in optischen Messsystemen mit strukturierter Beleuchtung&quot;,Technisches Messen,2012.](https://doi.org/10.1524/teme.2012.0256)&lt;a id=&quot;10&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt;[EMVA,&quot;Standard for Characterization of Image Sensors and Cameras Release 4.0 Linear&quot;,European Machine Vision Association,2021.](https://www.emva.org/standards-technology/emva-1288/emva-standard-1288-downloads-2/)&lt;a id=&quot;11&quot;&gt;[11]&lt;/a&gt;[Bothe,&quot;Grundlegende Untersuchungen zur Formerfassung mit einem neuartigen Prinzip der Streifenprojektion und Realisierung in einer kompakten 3D-Kamera&quot;,Dissertation,ISBN 978-3-933762-24-5,BIAS Bremen,2008.](https://www.amazon.de/Grundlegende-Untersuchungen-Formerfassung-Streifenprojektion-Strahltechnik/dp/3933762243/ref=sr_1_2?qid=1691575452&amp;refinements=p_27%3AThorsten+B%C3%B6th&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-2)&lt;!---&lt;a id=&quot;8&quot;&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;[Park,&quot;A twodimensional phase-shifting method for deflectometry&quot;,International Symposium on Optomechatronic Technologies,2008.](https://doi.org/10.1117/12.816472)&lt;a id=&quot;9&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt;[Huang,&quot;Color-encoded digital fringe projection technique for high-speed three-dimensional surface contouring&quot;,Optical Engineering,1999.](https://doi.org/10.1117/1.602151)&lt;a id=&quot;10&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt;[Trumper et al.,&quot;Instantaneous phase shifting deflectometry&quot;,Optics Express,2016.](10.1364/OE.24.027993)&lt;a id=&quot;11&quot;&gt;[11]&lt;/a&gt;[Liu et al.,&quot;Dual-frequency pattern scheme for high-speed 3-D shape measurement&quot;,Optics Express,2010.](https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.18.005229)&lt;a id=&quot;12&quot;&gt;[12]&lt;/a&gt;[Liu et al.,&quot;Fast and accurate deflectometry with crossed fringes&quot;,Advanced Optical Technologies,2014.](10.1515/aot-2014-0032)&lt;a id=&quot;13&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt;[Kludt and Burke,&quot;Coding strategies for static patterns suitable for UV deflectometry&quot;,Forum Bildverarbeitung 2018,2018.](https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000088264)#### [19] Inverse Laplace Filter---&gt;</longdescription>

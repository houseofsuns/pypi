	<longdescription># resource-policy-evaluation-libraryrpe-lib is made up of `Policy Engines (rpe.engines.Engine)`, `Resources (rpe.resources.Resource)`, and `Extractors (rpe.resources.Extractor)`.`Resources` produce details about the current state of a given type of resource. A resource can be just about anything, but the initial goal of the project was to support Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resources. The implemention is intentionally generic to allow support for other resource types`Policy Engines` evaluate `Resources` against their configured policies. Given a resource, they can return a list of `Evaluations (rpe.policy.Evaluation)` indicating the name of each policy that applies to the resource (by resource type), and whether or not the resource is compliant. `Resource` also define a `remediate()` function, that should be able to take a dictionary description of how to manipulate a resource to make it compliant.`Extractors` parse structured data and return a list of resources, and optionally metadata about the data source.As an example, for GCP resources, the `remediate()` function expects details about what method to call in the Google REST API for the given resource, and what parameters to pass. So for a Google Cloud Storage Bucket, a policy that enforces bucket versioning could define remediation as a call to the buckets `patch()` method with the appropriate arguments to enable versioning.[![Build Status](https://github.com/cleardataeng/resource-policy-evaluation-library/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cleardataeng/resource-policy-evaluation-library/actions/workflows/build.yml)[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/rpe-lib.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/rpe-lib)[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)---## Policy EnginesThere are currently 2 `Policy Engines` included with rpe-lib:### Open Policy Agent (opa) EngineThe Open Policy Agent engine uses the Open Policy Agent REST API to evalute policy for a given resource. In order to use this engine, you'll need to run the opa server with the rpe-lib base policies, and whatever policies you'd like to evaluate and optionally enforce. The opa engine passes the result of `Resource.get()` to the opa server as input. All policies need to be defined in the `rpe.policy` namespace, include a few specific rules, and operate on the `input` document:* _applies\_to_: a list of resource types the policy applies to* _description_: a human-readable description of the policy* _compliant_: returns true if the resource defined in the `input` document adheres to the policy* _excluded_: returns true if there is a reason to exclude the resource from evaluation, for GCP we define resource labels that can mark a resource as excluded* _remediate (optional)_: returns a JSON object explaining how to remediate the resource for the given policyExample policy:```# This is a real policy included with rpe-lib though slightly simplifiedpackage rpe.policy.storage_buckets_require_object_versioningdescription = &quot;Require object versioning for storage buckets&quot;applies_to = [&quot;storage.googleapis.com/Bucket&quot;]default compliant = falsedefault excluded = falsecompliant {        input.resource.versioning.enabled = true}excluded {        input.resource.labels[&quot;forseti-enforcer&quot;] = &quot;disabled&quot;}remediate = {        &quot;_remediation_spec&quot;: &quot;v2&quot;,        &quot;steps&quot;: [            &quot;method&quot;: &quot;patch&quot;,            &quot;params&quot;: {                    &quot;bucket&quot;: input.resource.name,                    &quot;body&quot;: {&quot;versioning&quot;: {&quot;enabled&quot;: true}},            }        ]}```### Python EngineThe OPA engine is very powerful, but is limited by what OPA is capable of. For use-cases that are more complicated, you might want to use the python engine. This engine expects the path to a python package that contains classes that perform the evaluation, and optionally remediation.As mentioned, the python policies are actually classes. Here is an example python policy class:```# Stubbed out example of the above OPA engine policy as a python engine policyclass GCPBucketVersioningPolicy:    description = 'Require object versioning for storage buckets'    applies_to = ['cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/Project']    @classmethod    def compliant(cls, resource):        return resource.get()['resource']['versioning']['enabled'] == True    @classmethod    def excluded(cls, resource):        return resource.get()['resource']['labels']['forseti-enforcer'] == 'disabled'    @classmethod    def remediate(cls, resource):        # execute cloudfuntion to enable versioning,        # or shell execute gsutil,        # or anything you can do with python        pass```When you configure your RPE object, you provide the path to your python package. That package doesn't need to be installed, it will be loaded dynamically. The path you provide should contain an `__init__.py` file with every policy class you wish to use. These can be defined directly in that file, or imported. Since RPElib takes care of importing the package, you will be able to use relative imports in your python files. For example your directory structure might look like this:```/etc/rpe/policies-python* __init__.py* policy1.py* policy2.py```And your `__init__.py` might look like this:```python# __init__.pyfrom .policy1 import MyFirstPythonPolicyfrom .policy2 import AnotherPythonPolicy, YetAnotherPolicy```## Resources`Resources` must define the following functions* `get()`: returns metadata describing the current state of the resource* `remediate(remediation_spec)`: applies the remediation (the spec is specific to the resource type/implementation)* `type()`: returns the type of resource, used by policy engines to determine which policies apply to a given resource## Examples#### Using the OPA engineThis assumes you have the `opa` binary in your path```# First, start opa with our policiesopa run --server ./policy/```Now we need to create an RPE instance with the opa engine configured to use the local OPA server:```pythonfrom rpe import RPEfrom rpe.resources import GoogleAPIResourceconfig = {    'policy_engines': [        {            'type': 'opa',            'url': 'http://localhost:8181/v1/data'        }    ]}rpe = RPE(config)# Create a resource object for the resource we want to evaluateres = GoogleAPIResource.from_cai_data(    '//storage.googleapis.com/my-test-bucket',    'storage.googleapis.com/Bucket',    project_id='my-test-project',)evals = rpe.evaluate(res)for e in evals:    print(f'Policy: {e.policy_id}, Compliant: {e.compliant}')    if not e.compliant and e.remediable:        e.remediate()```#### Using the Python engineUsing the Python policy engine is similar to the above:```pythonfrom rpe import RPEfrom rpe.resources import GoogleAPIResourceconfig = {    'policy_engines': [        {            'type': 'python',            'path': '/etc/rpe/policies-python'        }    ]}rpe = RPE(config)# Create resource objects, and evaluate as needed```And your policies may look like this:/etc/rpe/policies-python/__init__.py```pythonfrom .gcs_policy import GCPBucketVersioningPolicy```/etc/rpe/policies-python/gcs_policy.py```pythonclass GCPBucketVersioningPolicy:    description = 'Require object versioning for storage buckets'    applies_to = ['cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/Project']    @classmethod    def compliant(cls, resource):        # Return true/false if the resource is compliant    @classmethod    def excluded(cls, resource):        # Return true/false if the resource is excluded    @classmethod    def remediate(cls, resource):        # Enable versioning```# Applications using rpe-lib* [Forseti Real-time Enforcer](https://github.com/forseti-security/real-time-enforcer) - The Forseti Real-time enforcer uses rpe-lib for the evaluation and enforcement of policy for Google Cloud resources. It uses a Stackdriver log export to a Pub/Sub topic to trigger enforcement.</longdescription>

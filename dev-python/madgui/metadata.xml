	<longdescription>madgui======madgui is a Qt5 python GUI for interactive accelerator simulations usingMAD-X_ via cpymad_. It currently runs on python 3.4 and above, but higherpython versions may be required in the near future... _MAD-X: http://madx.web.cern.ch/madx.. _cpymad: https://github.com/hibtc/cpymadInstallation~~~~~~~~~~~~.. code-block:: bash    pip install madguiUsage~~~~~Now, you should be able to start madgui with the command::    madguiOptionally, madgui can take a filename for a madx/model file::    madgui /path/to/model.madxNote that madgui is currently only suited for relatively small sequences, onthe scale of few hundred elements at the most.Configuration~~~~~~~~~~~~~The application loads a YAML config file ``madgui.yml`` in the currentdirectory or the user's home directory.Example file:.. code-block:: yaml    model_path: ../hit_models    session_file: madgui.session.yml    online_control:      connect: true      backend: 'hit_acs.plugin:TestACS'    onload: |      code to execute on startupDevelopment guidelines~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~See `Developer's Guide`_... _Developer's Guide: https://hibtc.github.io/madgui/devguideCopying~~~~~~~Copyright 2016-2019 HIT Betriebs GmbHThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modifyit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published bythe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or(at your option) any later version.This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty ofMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

button- both:    - use spinbox=true by default    - use QuantityValue for floats (spin to win!)    - fix editting bool values    - fix display bug when showing SpinBox for IntValue    - fix &quot;save&quot; button- matching:    - match against variables inside expressions    - reuse computed init conditions after applying corrections- internal resource handling:    - remove PackageResource    - replace pkg_resources with importlib_resources where appropriate    - remove madgui.resource package- ellipses plots:    - add ellipse tab for init dialog    - add x/y labels    - use tight_layout    - use ui units    - draw ellipse over grid    - fix swapped ellipse axes when alpha is negative    - fix swapped formulas for the half axes- units:    - pass values internally as plain floats, convert only for IO/UI (#2)    - Replace all Expression instances by their values, get rid of      SymbolicValue    - introduce globals for ``madx_units`` and ``ui_units`` used for      conversion    - format degrees with &quot;°&quot; symbol    - improve unit labels for lists    - remove pint units file, use the default one shipped with pint instead1.7.2-----Date: 05.03.2018- added missing factor 2 in ellipse axes lengths- don't need AttrDict from new cpymad in this version1.7.1-----Date: 02.03.2018- fix knobs in skew quadrupoles- hotfix regression with posx/posy aliases- compatible with hit_models 0.7.0, hit_csys 0.6.01.7.0-----Date: 02.03.2018- compute alfa/beta from sigma matrix for consistency- expose ``twiss`` variable holding twiss table in python shell widget- set better display units for some plots- keep plot axis limits on most updates- finally start to use position dependent emittances in some places- add more plots: momentum/dispersion/phase advance/emittance/gamma- plot monitors as dashed lines- plot loaded/snapshot curves without markers- update infobox window title when changing element- add tab with global variables to init-settings dialog- add tabs to info box: primary/expert/twiss/sigma/ellipse- keep position in info-box when refreshing values or element- fit small tool buttons to text size- let user click on zero-length elements- scale interpolation step length with sequence length, to show smooth curves- default number_format.align=right- default mirror_mode=True- fix python shell, when starting madqt as gui_script under windows- rework the multi-grid dialog (for orbit correction)- rename back to madgui- new versioning scheme, interpret: ``0.0.X`` -&gt; ``1.X.0``, acknowledging the  the ``0.X.Y`` releases of the old wx-based madgui.- remove pytao binding- match dialog: dropdown menu for knobs, minor visual improvements- internal refactoring, module renamings- can connect online control without loaded model0.0.6-----Date: 26.01.2018- element info box: add UI to switch element- floor plan: support 3D models (no more curved sbends anymore though…)- floor plan: add UI to change view perspective- floor plan: fix mirror inversion- main/plot window: set window title- main window: add config setting for initial position- codebase: unify the workspace/segment mess, now only have 'model' again  (it's unlikely that we will ever be able to work on less/more than one  sequence in the same workspace anyway)0.0.5-----Date: 24.01.2018- fix mass unit in MAD-X- massive simplification of knobs API for interfacing control system- can read beam parameters from online plugin- show updated orbit plot after fitting in orbit-correction-mode (regression)- open orbit plot for orbit-correction-mode0.0.4-----Date: 09.01.2018- Emit signal when workspace is changed (for plugins…)- Show about boxes only if the package exists- Add about dialog for pytao- Change tab in settings dialog when clicking menu- When user invokes an action via a menu and the corresponding dialog  already exists, focus the existing window- No longer show checkboxes for twiss/beam dialogs in menu- Read spinbox setting from config- [regression] Fix exception (closed logfile) when opening different model- [regression] Fix exception in online-control module when changing values  into MAD-X0.0.3-----Date: 06.01.2018- fuzzy select when removing constraints in matching mode (middle click)- start log threads as daemon thread (never blocks program exit)- thread safe access to madx/tao- fetch element data for indicators in background- fix missing .ui files in installation- fix crash on windows at startup when starting via gui_scripts entrypoint0.0.2-----Date: 05.12.2017- continuous matching (within any element position)- fix bugs in matching code- updated dependencies: pint 0.8.1, cpymad&gt;=0.18.2, pytao&gt;=0.0.10.0.1-----Date: 30.11.2017First reference point to define somewhat stable versions.List of features:- cpymad/pytao as simulation backends- plots: alfa/beta/envelope/orbit; and the ones defined by tao- integrated python shell (ipython/jupyter) not very useful as of yet:  limited exhibition of objects, no convenient APIs provided (plotting)- log tab that shows madx/tao output- tab that shows madx/tao commands- display and edit box for beam parameters; initial conditions (i.e. twiss);  and element attributes (read-only so far)- 2D floor plan- matching (interactive + dialog)- emittance (dialog)- orbit alignment: 2-grid + N+optic methods</longdescription>

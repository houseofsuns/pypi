	<longdescription># SQLiteManagerUse a convenient SQLiteHandler object to manipulate SQLite(3) databases.## Version### 0.6.0- Extension type can be given to the handler to discern between .sqlite and .sqlite3- changed many functions to depend on the location variables of the handler class (path, filename, extension)make sure the extension variable does not miss the dot!- removed redundent steps or functions, mostly from the database class and added to the handler- added some more comments for functions- other fixes### 0.5.3- Removed some print statements that clutter the terminal during debugging- removed some redundent import statements### 0.5.0- Added test_gui for testing the library### 0.3.x- Adds handler.py with a SQLiteHandler object- moves support methods to helpers.py### 0.2.x- Basic objects in database.py for Database, Tables and Records## Install```pip install sqlitemanager```## How toPrimarily use the handler to do database manipulation for you instead of directly edit the data objects. The handler is built to make manipulation of the objects even simpler. See the test_gui.py file for a complete example of how to use the SQLiteHandler.https://github.com/Michael-Yongshi/SQLiteManager/blob/master/test_gui.py## TestsRun test_handler.py in order to test the package.For the Gui tests you need PyQt5 and pyqt-darktheme pip packages## LicenceLicensed under GPL-3.0-or-later, see LICENSE file for details.Copyright © 2020 Michael-Yongshi.This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

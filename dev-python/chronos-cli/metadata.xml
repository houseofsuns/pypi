It does its magic by looking at the commit messages of commits made since the last tag that had a [semver](https://semver.org) in it. For this to work properly, your commits should following the [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org) spec.# Getting started**Requires Git 2.0+.**To use the tool:- `pip install --upgrade chronos-cli`- Change into a Git repo.- `chronos infer`To bootstrap a development environment (after you've cloned the repo and changed into it):- `pip install --upgrade pipenv`- `pipenv sync --dev`# DocumentationDocs are hosted at https://chronos-cli.readthedocs.io.# StyleThis project follows [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).# Testing- `pytest` will run unit tests in this repo.- `flake8` will lint the code.This repo also has a CI/CD pipeline built with [Ansible](https://ansible.com) and [GitLab CI](https://about.gitlab.com/product/continuous-integration/).The pipeline's Ansible playbook can be run on your *nix workstation too:```shansible-playbook ansible/pipeline.yml --tags build```# ContributingCommits should follow the [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org) spec.# FAQTODO# Acknowledgements- Thanks to [Eric Poitras](https://github.com/eric-poitras) for asking me to write an earlier version of what would become this tool. This was really his idea.</longdescription>

In other words, it takes an **input configuration file** in the [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) format with a **domain specific semantics** and generate **automatically** the associated python code.In that way, the user only write (or use template) **configurations files** and run the whole system through the **CLI**.Thus, the user can focus on the problem without to manage the **cumberstone stuff** and **complex python codes**, generally involved for building and training ML/DL models.## ⁉️ WhyBecause at first, researchers and engineers are not necessary **Python programmers** or **ML specialists**. In addition, even for **specialists**, we want to bring a different way of building such complex systems with **productivity** in minds.## Built on the Python ecosystemWe do not want to **reinvent the wheel**, that's why **Pulsars** is built upon **Python ML/DL ecosystem**. - 🔁 Machine Learning Lifecycle ([mlflow](https://mlflow.org/))- 🤖 Machine Learning Algorithms ([XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)...)- 🕸️ Deep Learning Algorithms ([Keras](https://keras.io/), [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/))- 🛠️ Hyperparameters Tuning ([Ray Tune](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/index.html))- 📈 Results visualization ([Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html))### The Command Line Interface (CLI)Pulsars provide an expressive CLI to manage and run the whole system - [Click](https://panel.holoviz.org/index.html)## 📚 DocumentationTo do ...## 💻 Installation```bashpip install pulsars```## For developement### 🔗 DependenciesTo do ...## ⚠️ Under constructionThis project is at the **early developement stage** and is truly **experimental**.This mean **most** of the features are **missing** and the documentation is still **lacking**.The project **github** repository will be available soon ! Stay tuned !After the public release of the github repository, contributions of any kinds (code, documentation, website, community ...) will be really welcome !😁</longdescription>

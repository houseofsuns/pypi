No interruption.# InstallUse the npm dist tag to opt in CDKv1 or CDKv2:```sh// for CDKv2npm install cdk-spot-oneornpm install cdk-spot-one@latest// for CDKv1npm install cdk-spot-one@cdkv1```# WhySometimes we need an Amazon EC2 instance with static fixed IP for testing or development purpose for a duration oftime(probably hours). We need to make sure during this time, no interruption will occur and we don't want to payfor on-demand rate. `cdk-spot-one` helps you reserve one single spot instance with pre-allocated or newElastic IP addresses(EIP) with defined `blockDuration`, during which time the spot instance will be secured with no spot interruption.Behind the scene, `cdk-spot-one` provisions a spot fleet with capacity of single instance for you and it associates the EIP with this instance. The spot fleet is reserved as spot block with `blockDuration` from one hour up to six hours to ensure the high availability for your spot instance.Multiple spot instances are possible by simply specifying the `targetCapacity` construct property, but we only associate the EIP with the first spot instance at this moment.Enjoy your highly durable one spot instance with AWS CDK!# ConstructsThis library provides two major constructs:## SpotInstance* Create a spot instance **without** any fleet* Does **NOT** support [Spot Block](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-requests.html#fixed-duration-spot-instances)* Support `stop` or `hibernate` instanceScenario: To leverage the `stop` or `hibernate` capabilities of the spot instance to persist the data in the ebs volume.## SpotFleet* Create a spot instance with a [Spot Fleet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet.html)* Support [Spot Block](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-requests.html#fixed-duration-spot-instances)* Does **NOT** support `stop` or `hibernate` instanceScenario: To ensure the availability with no disruption with defined period up to 6 hours.# Sample## SpotInstance```pythonimport { SpotInstance, AmazonMachineImage } from 'cdk-spot-one';// Default use Amazon Linux 2new SpotInstance(stack, 'SpotInstance');// Custom Id use Ubuntu 20.04 Arm64 Server.new SpotInstance(stack, 'SpotInstanceUbuntu', {      vpc,      customAmiId: AmazonMachineImage.UBUNTU_20_04_ARM64.getImage(stack).imageId,      defaultInstanceType: new InstanceType('t4g.medium'),      keyName,      blockDeviceMappings: [{ deviceName: '/dev/sda1', ebs: { volumeSize: 20 } }],      additionalUserData: ['curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh', 'sudo sh get-docker.sh'],    });```## SpotFleet```pythonimport { SpotFleet } from 'cdk-spot-one';// create the first fleet for one hour and associate with our existing EIPconst fleet = new SpotFleet(stack, 'SpotFleet')// configure the expiration after 1 hourfleet.expireAfter(Duration.hours(1))// create the 2nd fleet with single Gravition 2 instance for 6 hours and associate with new EIPconst fleet2 = new SpotFleet(stack, 'SpotFleet2', {  blockDuration: BlockDuration.SIX_HOURS,  eipAllocationId: 'eipalloc-0d1bc6d85895a5410',  defaultInstanceType: new InstanceType('c6g.large'),  vpc: fleet.vpc,})// configure the expiration after 6 hoursfleet2.expireAfter(Duration.hours(6))// print the instanceId from each spot fleetnew CfnOutput(stack, 'SpotFleetInstanceId', { value: fleet.instanceId })new CfnOutput(stack, 'SpotFleet2InstanceId', { value: fleet2.instanceId })```# Create spot instances without duration block```pythonconst fleet = new SpotFleet(stack, 'SpotFleet', {  blockDuration: BlockDuration.NONE,})```NOTE: This kind of spot instance will be interrupted by AWS. However the fleet is using type [maintain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet.html#spot-fleet-allocation-strategy), the fleet can be refulfilled.# ARM64 and Graviton 2 support`cdk-spot-one` selects the latest Amazon Linux 2 AMI for your `ARM64` instances. Simply select the instance types with the `defaultInstanceType` property and the `SpotFleet` will auto configure correct AMI for the instance.```pythondefaultInstanceType: new InstanceType('c6g.large')```# ECS Cluster supportSee https://github.com/pahud/cdk-spot-one/issues/270#issuecomment-877152685# Connect with Session Manager(recommended)You may connect to the spot instance with [Session Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-sessions-start.html).```sh# make sure you have installed session-manager-plugin$ session-manager-plugin# start session$ aws ssm start-session --target INSTANCE_ID```# Connect with EC2 SSH ConnectBy default the `cdk-spot-one` does not bind any SSH public key for you on the instance. You are encouraged to use `ec2-instance-connect` to send your public key from local followed by one-time SSH connect.For example:```shpubkey=&quot;$HOME/.ssh/aws_2020_id_rsa.pub&quot;echo &quot;sending public key to ${instanceId}&quot;aws ec2-instance-connect send-ssh-public-key --instance-id ${instanceId} --instance-os-user ec2-user \--ssh-public-key file://${pubkey} --availability-zone ${az}```## npx ec2-connect INSTANCE_IDTo connect to the instance, run `npx ec2-connect` as below:```sh$ npx ec2-connect i-01f827ab9de7b93a9```or```sh$ npx ec2-connect i-01f827ab9de7b93a9 ~/.ssh/other_public_key_path```If you are using different SSH public key(default is ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)</longdescription>

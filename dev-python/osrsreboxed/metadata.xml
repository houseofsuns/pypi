These properties include the item ID and name, whether an item is tradeable, stackable, orequipable or if the item is members only. For any equipable item, there are additional properties about combat stats; for example, what slash attackbonus, magic defence bonus or prayer bonus that an item provides. For weapons, additional properties are added which include attack speed, combatstance and weapon type information.The monster database also has extensive properties: a total of 44 unique properties for each monster, as well as an array of item drops for eachmonster that has 6 additional properties per item drop. The base properties include the monster ID, name, member status, slayer properties, attacktype, max hit, attack types and all monster combat stats. Each monster also has an associated array of drops which document the item ID, name, rarity,quantity, and any requirements to get the drop.The prayer database documents each prayer that available in-game and has detailed properties: a total of 8 properties for every prayer. The baseproperties include the prayer name, members status, description, requirements, and bonuses that it provides.## Table of Contents-   [Project Summary](#project-summary)-   [The `osrsreboxed` Python PyPi Package](#the-osrsreboxed-python-pypi-package)-   [The osrsreboxed RESTful API](#the-osrsreboxed-restful-api)-   [The `osrsreboxed-db` GitHub Repository](#the-osrsreboxed-db-github-repository)-   [The Item Database](#the-item-database)-   [The Monster Database](#the-monster-database)-   [The Prayer Database](#the-prayer-database)-   [Project Contribution](#project-contribution)-   [Additional Project Information](#additional-project-information)## Project SummaryThe osrsbox-db project provides data for three different categories:1. **Items**1. **Monsters**1. **Prayers**The osrsbox-db project and data is accessible using four methods:1. [**The Python PyPi package**](https://pypi.org/project/osrsreboxed/)1. [**The RESTful API**](https://github.com/0xNeffarion/osrsbox-api/)1. [**The Static JSON API**](https://github.com/0xNeffarion/osrsreboxed-db/tree/master/docs)With four different methods to access data... most people will have the following question: _Which one should I use?_ The following list is ashort-sharp summary of the options:1. [**The Python PyPi package**](https://pypi.org/project/osrsreboxed/): Use this if you are programming anything in Python - as it is the simplest   option. Install using `pip`, and you are ready to do anything from experimenting and prototyping, to building a modern web app using something like   Flask.1. [**The RESTful API**](https://github.com/0xNeffarion/osrsbox-api/): Use this if you are not programming in Python, and want an Internet-accessible   API with rich-quering including filtering, sorting and projection functionality.1. [**The Static JSON API**](https://github.com/0xNeffarion/osrsreboxed-db/tree/master/docs): Use this if you want Internet-accessible raw data (JSON   files and PNG images) and don't need queries to filter data. This is a good option if you want to _dump_ the entire database contents, and saves   the RESTful API from un-needed traffic.## The `osrsreboxed` Python PyPi PackageIf you want to access the item and monster database programmatically using Python, the simplest option is to use the[`osrsreboxed` package available from PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/osrsreboxed/). You can load the item and/or monster database and process itemobjects, monster objects, and their properties.### Package Quick Start-   Make sure you have &gt;= Python 3.6-   Install package using: `pip install osrsreboxed`-   Item database quick start:    -   Import items API using: `from osrsreboxed import items_api`    -   Load all items using: `items = items_api.load()`    -   Loop items using: `for item in items: print(item.name)`-   Monster database quick start:    -   Import monsters API using: `from osrsreboxed import monsters_api`    -   Load all monsters using: `monsters = monsters_api.load()`    -   Loop monsters using: `for monster in monsters: print(monster.name)`-   Prayer database quick start:    -   Import prayers API using: `from osrsreboxed import prayers_api`    -   Load all prayers using: `prayers = prayers_api.load()`    -   Loop prayers using: `for prayer in prayers: print(prayer.name)`### Package RequirementsFor the `osrsreboxed` PyPi package you must meet the following requirements:-   Python 3.6 or above-   Pip package manager-   Dataclasses package (if Python is below 3.7)If you are using Python 3.6, the `dataclasses` package will automatically be installed. If you are using Python 3.7 or above, the `dataclasses`package is part of the standard library and will not be installed automatically.### Package InstallationThe easiest way to install the osrsreboxed package is through the [Python Package Index](http://pypi.python.org/) using the `pip` command. You need tohave `pip` installed - and make sure it is updated (especially on Windows). Then you can install the `osrsreboxed` package using the following `pip`command:```pip install osrsreboxed```### Package UpgradingThe package is consistently updated - usually after each weekly in-game update. This is because the in-game update usually introduces additional itemsinto the game or changes existing items. Therefore, you should regularly check and update the `osrsreboxed` package. To achieve this, run `pip` withthe `upgrade` flag, as demonstrated in the following command:```pip install --upgrade osrsreboxed```### Package UsageThe key use of the `osrsreboxed` package is to load and automate the processing of OSRS items and their associated metadata. You can load the packageusing `import osrsreboxed`, however, you probably want to load the `items_api` module or `monsters_api` module. A simple example of using the packageto `load` all the items, then loop and print out the item ID and name of every item in OSRS is provided below:```Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.&gt;&gt;&gt; from osrsreboxed import items_api&gt;&gt;&gt; items = items_api.load()&gt;&gt;&gt; for item in items:...     print(item.id, item.name)```Instead of using the Python interpreter, you can also write a simple script and import the `osrsreboxed` Python package. An example script is providedbelow, this time for the `monsters_api`:```#!/usr/bin/python3from osrsreboxed import monsters_apimonsters = monsters_api.load()for monster in monsters:    print(monster.id, monster.name)```If you would like to review additional examples of using the `osrsreboxed` Python API, have a look at the[`items_api_examples` folder](https://github.com/0xNeffarion/osrsreboxed-db/tree/master/osrsreboxed/items_api_examples) and[`monsters_api_examples` folder](https://github.com/0xNeffarion/osrsreboxed-db/tree/master/osrsreboxed/monsters_api_examples). There are a number ofscripts available that provide examples of loading and processing data using the Python API.## The osrsreboxed RESTful APIThe [official osrsreboxed-api GitHub repository](https://github.com/0xNeffarion/osrsbox-api) hosts the source code used for the RESTful API. Theofficial `osrsbox-api` project is available from:### Static JSON API FilesThe JSON API is available in the [`docs` folder](https://github.com/0xNeffarion/osrsreboxed-db/tree/master/docs/) in the osrsbox-db projectrepository. This folder contains the publicly available database. Every file inside this specific folder can be fetched using HTTP GET requests.-   `items-complete.json`: A single JSON file that combines all single JSON files from `items-json` folder. This file contains the entire osrsbox-db    items database in one file. This is useful if you want to get the data for every single item.-   `items-icons`: Collection of PNG files (20K+) for every item inventory icon in OSRS. Each inventory icon is named using the unique item ID number.-   `items-json`: Collection of JSON files (20K+) of extensive item metadata for every item in OSRS. This folder contains the entire osrsbox-db item    database where each item has an individual JSON file, named using the unique item ID number. This is useful when you want to fetch data for a    single item where you already know the item ID number.-   `items-json-slot`: Collection of JSON files extracted from the database that are specific for each equipment slot (e.g., head, legs). This is    useful when you want to only get item data for equipable items for one, or multiple, specific item slot.-   `items-summary.json`: A single JSON file that contains only the item names and item ID numbers. This file is useful when you want to download a    small file (1.1MB) to quickly scan/process item data when you only need the item name and/or ID number.-   `models-summary.json`: A single JSON file that contains model ID numbers for items, objects, and NPCs. This file is useful to determine the model    ID number for a specific item, object or NPC.-   `monsters-complete.json`: A single JSON file that combines all single JSON files from the `monsters-json` folder. This file contains the entire    osrsbox-db monster database in one file. This is useful if you want to get the data for every single monster in one file.-   `monsters-json`: Collection of JSON files (2.5K+) of extensive monster metadata for every monster in OSRS. This folder contains the entire    osrsbox-db monster database where each monster has an individual JSON file, named using the unique monster ID number. This is useful when you want    to fetch data for a single monster where you already know the item ID number.-   `npcs-summary.json`: A single JSON file that contains only the NPC names and NPC ID numbers. This file is useful when you want to download a small    file (0.35MB) to quickly scan/process NPC data when you only need the NPC name and/or ID number. Note that this file contains both attackable, and    non-attackable (monster) NPCs.-   `objects-summary.json`: A single JSON file that contains only the object names and object ID numbers. This file is useful when you want to    download a small file (0.86MB) to quickly scan/process in-game object data when you only need the object name and/or ID number.-   `prayer-icon`: Collection of PNG files for each prayer in OSRS.-   `prayer-json`: Collection of individual JSON files with properties and metadata about OSRS prayers.### Accessing the Static JSON APITAs mentioned, you can fetch JSON files using a unique URL, but cannot modify any JSON content. Below is a list of URL examples for items and monstersin the osrsbox-db database:-   [`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xNeffarion/osrsreboxed-db/master/docs/items-json/2.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xNeffarion/osrsreboxed-db/master/docs/items-json/2.json)-   [`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xNeffarion/osrsreboxed-db/master/docs/items-json/74.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xNeffarion/osrsreboxed-db/master/docs/items-json/74.json)-   [`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xNeffarion/osrsreboxed-db/master/docs/items-json/35.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xNeffarion/osrsreboxed-db/master/docs/items-json/35.json)-   [`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xNeffarion/osrsreboxed-db/master/docs/items-json/415.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xNeffarion/osrsreboxed-db/master/docs/items-json/415.json)-   [`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xNeffarion/osrsreboxed-db/master/docs/items-json/239.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xNeffarion/osrsreboxed-db/master/docs/items-json/239.json)As displayed by the links above, each item or monster is stored in the `osrsreboxed-db` repository, under the[`items-json`](https://github.com/0xNeffarion/osrsreboxed-db/tree/master/docs/items-json) folder or[`monsters-json`](https://github.com/0xNeffarion/osrsreboxed-db/tree/master/docs/monsters-json) folder. In addition to the single JSON files for eachitem, many other JSON files can be fetched. Some more examples are provided below:-   [`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xNeffarion/osrsreboxed-db/master/docs/items-complete.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xNeffarion/osrsreboxed-db/master/docs/items-complete.json)-   [`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xNeffarion/osrsreboxed-db/master/docs/monsters-complete.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xNeffarion/osrsreboxed-db/master/docs/monsters-complete.json)-   [`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xNeffarion/osrsreboxed-db/master/docs/items-summary.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xNeffarion/osrsreboxed-db/master/docs/items-summary.json)-   [`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xNeffarion/osrsreboxed-db/master/docs/items-json-slot/items-cape.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xNeffarion/osrsreboxed-db/master/docs/items-json-slot/items-cape.json)-   [`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xNeffarion/osrsreboxed-db/master/docs/prayer-json/protect-from-magic.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xNeffarion/osrsreboxed-db/master/docs/prayer-json/protect-from-magic.json)So how can you get and use these JSON files about OSRS items? It is pretty easy but depends on what you are trying to accomplish and what programminglanguage you are using. Some examples are provided in the following subsections.### Accessing the JSON API using Command Line ToolsTake a simple example of downloading a single JSON file. In a Linux system, we could use the `wget` command to download a single JSON file, asillustrated in the example code below:```wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xNeffarion/osrsreboxed-db/master/docs/items-json/12453.json```You could perform a similar technique using the `curl` tool:```curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xNeffarion/osrsreboxed-db/master/docs/items-json/12453.json```For Windows users, you could use PowerShell:```Invoke-WebRequest -Uri &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xNeffarion/osrsreboxed-db/master/docs/items-json/12453.json&quot; -OutFile &quot;12453.json&quot;```### Accessing the JSON API using PythonMaybe you are interested in downloading a single (or potentially multiple) JSON files about OSRS items and processing the information in a Pythonprogram. The short script below downloads the `12453.json` file using Python's `urllib` library, loads the data as a JSON object and prints thecontents to the console. The code is a little messy, primarily due to supporting both Python 2 and 3 - as you can see from the `try` and `except`importing method implemented.```import jsontry:    from urllib.request import urlopenexcept ImportError:    from urllib2 import urlopenurl = (&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xNeffarion/osrsreboxed-db/master/docs/items-json/12453.json&quot;)response = urlopen(url)data = response.read().decode(&quot;utf-8&quot;)json_obj = json.loads(data)print(json_obj)```### Accessing the JSON API using JavaScriptFinally, let's have a look at JavaScript (specifically jQuery) example to fetch a JSON file from the osrsbox-db and build an HTML element to displayin a web page. The example below is a very simple method to download the JSON file using the jQuery `getJSON` function. Once we get the JSON file, weloop through the JSON entries and print each key and value (e.g., `name` and _Black wizard hat (g)_) on its own line in a `div` element.```&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html&gt;  &lt;head&gt;    &lt;script src=&quot;https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;    &lt;script&gt;      $(document).ready(function(){          $(&quot;button&quot;).click(function(){              $.getJSON(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xNeffarion/osrsreboxed-db/master/docs/items-json/12453.json&quot;, function(result){                  $.each(result, function(i, field){                      $(&quot;div&quot;).append(i + &quot; &quot; + field + &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;);                  });              });          });      });    &lt;/script&gt;  &lt;/head&gt;  &lt;body&gt;    &lt;button&gt;Get JSON data&lt;/button&gt;    &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;```## The `osrsreboxed-db` GitHub RepositoryThe [official osrsreboxed-db GitHub repository](https://github.com/0xNeffarion/osrsreboxed-db) hosts the source code for the entire osrsreboxed-dbproject. The Python PyPi package is located in the `osrsreboxed` folder of the official development repository, while the other folders in thisrepository are used to store essential data and Python modules to build the item database.### Using the Development RepositoryIf using this repository (the development version), you will need to fulfill some specific requirements. This includes having the following toolsavailable on your system:-   Python 3.6 or above-   Pip - the standard package manager for Python-   A selection of additional Python packagesAs a short example, I configured my Ubuntu 18.04 system to run the development repository code using the following steps:```sudo apt updatesudo apt install python3-pip```These two commands will install the `pip3` command, allowing the installation of Python packages. Then you can use `pip3` to install additionalpackages. The development repository requires a variety of Python packages in addition to the mandatory `dataclasses` package. These packagerequirements are documented in the [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/osrsbox/osrsbox-db/tree/master/requirements.txt) file. It is recommended touse the `venv` module to set up your environment, then install the specified requirements. As an example, the following workflow is provided forLinux-based environments (make sure `python3` is available first):```git clone --recursive https://github.com/0xNeffarion/osrsreboxed-db.gitcd osrsreboxed-dbpython -m venv venvsource venv/bin/activatepip3 install -r requirements.txt```When you have finished with working in the `osrsreboxed-db` repository, make sure to deactivate the current `venv` environment using:```deactivate```### Summary of Repository Structure-   `builders`: The builders are the code that performs automatic regeneration of the databases. These builders read in a variety of data and produce    a JSON file for each item or monster.    -   `items`: The item database builder that uses a collection of Python scripts to build the item database. The `builder.py` script is the primary        entry point, and the `build_item.py` module does the processing of each item.    -   `monsters`: The monster database builder that uses a collection of Python scripts to build the monster database. The `builder.py` script is        the primary entry point, and the `build_monster.py` module does the processing of each monster. Additionally, the `drop_table.py` module        contains a selection of hard-coded drop tables for the various OSRS Wiki drop table templates such as the rare, herb, seed, gem and catacombs        drop tables.-   `data`: Collection of useful data files used in the osrsbox-db project.    -   `cache`: OSRS client cache dump (not present in repository due to size, but populated using the `scripts/cache` scripts).    -   `icons`: Item and prayer icons in base64.    -   `items`: Data used for item database generation.    -   `monsters`: Data used for monster database generation.    -   `schemas`: JSON schemas for the item and monster database, as well as schemas for item, npc and object definitions from cache data.    -   `wiki`: OSRS Wiki data dump including all item and monster page titles and page data.-   `docs`: The publicly accessible item database available through this repo or by using the static JSON API. This folder contains the actual item    database that is publicly available, or browsable within this repository (see section above for more information).-   `osrsreboxed`: The Python PyPi package:    -   `items_api`: The Python API for interacting with the items database. The API has modules to load all items in the database, iterate through        items, and access the different item properties.    -   `items_api_examples`: A collection of simple Python scripts that use the `items_api` to provide an example of what can be achieved and how to        use the items database.    -   `monsters_api`: The Python API for interacting with the monster database. The API has modules to load all monsters in the database, iterate        through items, and access different monster properties.    -   `monsters_api_examples`: A collection of simple Python scripts that use the `monsters_api` to provide an example of what can be achieved and        how to use the monster's database.-   `scripts`: A collection of scripts (using Python and BASH) to help automate common tasks including dumping the OSRS cache, scraping the OSRS wiki,    generating schemas, updating the databases, and inserting data into a MongoDB database.    -   `cache`: A collection of scripts to extract useful data from the OSRS cache item, npc and object definition files.    -   `icons`: Various scripts to help process, check or update item icons.    -   `items`: A collection of scripts to help process data for the item builder.    -   `monsters`: A collection of scripts to help process data for the monster builder.    -   `update`: A collection of scripts for automating the data collection and database regeneration.    -   `wiki`: A collection of scripts for automating data extraction from the OSRS Wiki using the MediaWiki API.-   `test`: A collection of PyTest tests.## The Item DatabaseEach item is represented by Python objects when using the PyPi `osrsbox` package, specifically using Python dataclass objects. Additionally, the datais accessible directly by parsing the raw JSON files. There are three types of objects, or classifications of data, that can be used to represent partof an in-game OSRS item, each outlined in the following subsections.### Item PropertiesAn `ItemProperties` object type includes basic item metadata such as `id`, `name`, `examine` text, store `cost`, `highalch` and `lowalch` values and`quest_item` association. Every item object in the item database has all of these properties. If you are parsing the raw JSON files all of theseproperties are in the root of the JSON document - so they are not nested. All of the properties available are listed in the table below including theproperty name, the data types used, a description of the property, if the property is required to be populated, and if the property is nullable (ableto be set to `null` or `None`).| Property              | Data type | Description                                                        | Required | Nullable || --------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | -------- || id                    | integer   | Unique OSRS item ID number.                                        | True     | False    || name                  | string    | The name of the item.                                              | True     | False    || last_updated          | string    | The last time (UTC) the item was updated (in ISO8601 date format). | True     | False    || incomplete            | boolean   | If the item has incomplete wiki data.                              | True     | False    || members               | boolean   | If the item is a members-only.                                     | True     | False    || tradeable             | boolean   | If the item is tradeable (between players and on the GE).          | True     | False    || tradeable_on_ge       | boolean   | If the item is tradeable (only on GE).                             | True     | False    || stackable             | boolean   | If the item is stackable (in inventory).                           | True     | False    || stacked               | integer   | If the item is stacked, indicated by the stack count.              | True     | True     || noted                 | boolean   | If the item is noted.                                              | True     | False    || noteable              | boolean   | If the item is noteable.                                           | True     | False    || linked_id_item        | integer   | The linked ID of the actual item (if noted/placeholder).           | True     | True     || linked_id_noted       | integer   | The linked ID of an item in noted form.                            | True     | True     || linked_id_placeholder | integer   | The linked ID of an item in placeholder form.                      | True     | True     || placeholder           | boolean   | If the item is a placeholder.                                      | True     | False    || equipable             | boolean   | If the item is equipable (based on right-click menu entry).        | True     | False    || equipable_by_player   | boolean   | If the item is equipable in-game by a player.                      | True     | False    || equipable_weapon      | boolean   | If the item is an equipable weapon.                                | True     | False    || cost                  | integer   | The store price of an item.                                        | True     | False    || lowalch               | integer   | The low alchemy value of the item (cost \* 0.4).                   | True     | True     || highalch              | integer   | The high alchemy value of the item (cost \* 0.6).                  | True     | True     || weight                | float     | The weight (in kilograms) of the item.                             | True     | True     || buy_limit             | integer   | The Grand Exchange buy limit of the item.                          | True     | True     || quest_item            | boolean   | If the item is associated with a quest.                            | True     | False    || release_date          | string    | Date the item was released (in ISO8601 format).                    | True     | True     || duplicate             | boolean   | If the item is a duplicate.                                        | True     | False    || examine               | string    | The examine text for the item.                                     | True     | True     || icon                  | string    | The item icon (in base64 encoding).                                | True     | False    || wiki_name             | string    | The OSRS Wiki name for the item.                                   | True     | True     || wiki_url              | string    | The OSRS Wiki URL (possibly including anchor link).                | True     | True     || equipment             | dict      | The equipment bonuses of equipable armour/weapons.                 | True     | True     || weapon                | dict      | The weapon bonuses including attack speed, type and stance.        | True     | True     |### Item EquipmentMany items in OSRS are equipable, this includes armor, weapons, and other _wearable_ items. Any equipable item has additional properties stored as an`ItemEquipment` object type - including attributes such as `attack_slash`, `defence_crush` and `melee_strength` values. The `ItemEquipment` object isnested within an `ItemProperties`. If you are parsing the raw JSON files, this data is nested under the `equipment` key. It is very important to notethat not all items in OSRS are equipable. Only items with the `equipable_by_player` property set to `true` are equipable. The `equipable` property issimilar, but this is the raw data extracted from the game cache - and can sometimes be incorrect (not equipable by a player). All of the propertiesavailable for equipable items are listed in the table below including the property name, the data types used, a description of the property, if theproperty is required to be populated, and if the property is nullable (able to be set to `null` or `None`).| Property        | Data type | Description                                               | Required | Nullable || --------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------- || attack_stab     | integer   | The attack stab bonus of the item.                        | True     | False    || attack_slash    | integer   | The attack slash bonus of the item.                       | True     | False    || attack_crush    | integer   | The attack crush bonus of the item.                       | True     | False    || attack_magic    | integer   | The attack magic bonus of the item.                       | True     | False    || attack_ranged   | integer   | The attack ranged bonus of the item.                      | True     | False    || defence_stab    | integer   | The defence stab bonus of the item.                       | True     | False    || defence_slash   | integer   | The defence slash bonus of the item.                      | True     | False    || defence_crush   | integer   | The defence crush bonus of the item.                      | True     | False    || defence_magic   | integer   | The defence magic bonus of the item.                      | True     | False    || defence_ranged  | integer   | The defence ranged bonus of the item.                     | True     | False    || melee_strength  | integer   | The melee strength bonus of the item.                     | True     | False    || ranged_strength | integer   | The ranged strength bonus of the item.                    | True     | False    || magic_damage    | integer   | The magic damage bonus of the item.                       | True     | False    || prayer          | integer   | The prayer bonus of the item.                             | True     | False    || slot            | string    | The equipment slot associated with the item (e.g., head). | True     | False    || requirements    | dict      | An object of requirements {skill: level}.                 | True     | True     |### Item WeaponA select number of items in OSRS are equipable weapons. Any equipable item that is a weapon has additional properties stored as an `ItemWeapon` typeobject including attributes such as `attack_speed` and `weapon_types` values. Additionally, each weapon has an array of combat stances associated withit to determine the `combat_style`, `attack_type`, `attack_style` and any `bonuses` or combat `experience` association. The `ItemWeapon` object isnested within an `ItemProperties` object when using the Python API. If you are parsing the raw JSON files, this data is nested under the `weapon` key.It is very important to note that not all items in OSRS are equipable weapons. Only items with the `equipable_weapon` property set to `true` areequipable. All of the properties available for equipable weapons are listed in the table below including the property name, the data types used, adescription of the property, if the property is required to be populated, and if the property is nullable (able to be set to `null` or `None`).| Property     | Data type | Description                                   | Required | Nullable || ------------ | --------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------- || attack_speed | integer   | The attack speed of a weapon (in game ticks). | True     | False    || weapon_type  | string    | The weapon classification (e.g., axes)        | True     | False    || stances      | list      | An array of weapon stance information.        | True     | False    |### Item: Python Object ExampleA description of the properties that each item in the database can have is useful, but sometimes it is simpler to provide an example. Below is a fullexample of an item as loaded in a Python object, specifically the _Abyssal whip_ item. Since this item is a type of equipment, there is an`EquipmentProperties` object nested with combat bonuses. Additionally, this item is also a weapon, so there is a `WeaponProperties` object with extrainformation. If the item was not equipable, the `EquipmentProperties` property would be `None` and the `equipable_by_player` would be `False`. If theitem was not a weapon, the `WeaponProperties` key would be `None` and the `equipable_weapon` would be `False`.```ItemProperties(    id=4151,    name='Abyssal whip',    last_updated='2020-12-27',    incomplete=False,    members=True,    tradeable=True,    tradeable_on_ge=True,    stackable=False,    stacked=None,    noted=False,    noteable=True,    linked_id_item=None,    linked_id_noted=4152,    linked_id_placeholder=14032,    placeholder=False,    equipable=True,    equipable_by_player=True,    equipable_weapon=True,    cost=120001,    lowalch=48000,    highalch=72000,    weight=0.453,    buy_limit=70,    quest_item=False,    release_date='2005-01-26',    duplicate=False,    examine='A weapon from the abyss.',    icon='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',    wiki_name='Abyssal whip',    wiki_url='https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Abyssal_whip',    equipment=ItemEquipment(        attack_stab=0,        attack_slash=82,        attack_crush=0,        attack_magic=0,        attack_ranged=0,        defence_stab=0,        defence_slash=0,        defence_crush=0,        defence_magic=0,        defence_ranged=0,        melee_strength=82,        ranged_strength=0,        magic_damage=0,        prayer=0,        slot='weapon',        requirements={'attack': 70}    ),    weapon=ItemWeapon(        attack_speed=4,        weapon_type='whip',        stances=[            {                'combat_style': 'flick',                'attack_type': 'slash',                'attack_style': 'accurate',                'experience': 'attack',                'boosts': None            },            {                'combat_style': 'lash',                'attack_type': 'slash',                'attack_style': 'controlled',                'experience': 'shared',                'boosts': None},            {                'combat_style': 'deflect',                'attack_type': 'slash',                'attack_style': 'defensive',                'experience': 'defence',                'boosts': None            }        ]    ))```### Item: JSON ExampleA description of the properties that each item in the database can have is useful, but sometimes it is simpler to provide an example.

Additionally,the data is accessible directly by parsing the raw JSON files. There are two types of objects, or classifications of data, that can be used torepresent part of an in-game OSRS monster, each outlined in the following subsections.### Monster PropertiesA `MonsterProperties` object type includes basic monster metadata such as `id`, `name`, `examine` text, `combat_level`, `attack_speed` and `hitpoints`values and slayer association such as `slayer_masters` who give this monster as a task. Every monster object in the monster database has all of theseproperties. If you are parsing the raw JSON files all of these properties are in the root of the JSON document - so they are not nested. All of theproperties available are listed in the table below including the property name, the data types used, a description of the property, if the property isrequired to be populated, and if the

DropsMost monsters in OSRS drop items when they have been defeated (killed). All monster drops are stored in the `drops` property in an array containingproperties about the item drop. When using the PyPi `osrsreboxed` package, these drops are represented by a list of `MonsterDrops` object type. Whenparsing the raw JSON files, the drops are stored in an array, that are nested under the `drops` key. The data included with the monster drops are theitem `id`, item `name`, the drop `rarity`, whether the drop is `noted` and any `drop_requirements`. All of the properties available for item drops arelisted in the table below including the property name, the data types used, a description of the property, if the property is required to bepopulated, and if the property is nullable (able to be set to `null` or `None`).| Property | Data type | Description                                                        | Required | Nullable || -------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | -------- || id       | integer   | The ID number of the item drop.                                    | True     | False    || name     | string    | The name of the item drop.                                         | True     | False    || members  | boolean   | If the drop is a members-only item.                                | True     | False    || quantity | string    | The quantity of the item drop (integer, comma-separated or range). | True     | True     || noted    | boolean   | If the item drop is noted, or not.                                 | True     | False    || rarity   | float     | The rarity of the item drop (as a float out of 1.0).               | True     | False    || rolls    | integer   | Number of rolls from the drop.                                     | True     | False    |### Monster: Python Object ExampleA description of the properties that each monster in the database can have is useful, but sometimes it is simpler to provide an example.

All prayer data is stored in a single object to represent the properties of an in-game OSRSprayer, which is outlined in the following subsection.### Prayer PropertiesA `PrayerProperties` object type includes basic prayer metadata such as `id`, `name`, `description` text, `drain_per_minute`, `requirements` and`bonuses` values. Every prayer object in the prayer database has all of these properties. If you are parsing the raw JSON files all of theseproperties are in the root of the JSON document - so they are not nested. All of the properties available are listed in the table below including theproperty name, the data types used, a description of the property, if the property is required to be populated, and if the property is nullable (ableto be set to `null` or `None`).| Property         | Data type | Description                               | Required | Nullable || ---------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------- | -------- || id               | integer   | Unique prayer ID number.                  | True     | False    || name             | string    | The name of the prayer.                   | True     | False    || members          | boolean   | If the prayer is members-only.            | True     | False    || description      | string    | The prayer description (as show in-game). | True     | False    || drain_per_minute | float     | The prayer point drain rate per minute.   | True     | False    || wiki_url         | string    | The OSRS Wiki URL.                        | True     | False    || requirements     | dict      | The stat requirements to use the prayer.  | True     | False    || bonuses          | dict      | The bonuses a prayer provides.            | True     | False    || icon             | string    | The prayer icon.                          | True     | False    |### Prayer: Python Object ExampleA description of the properties that each prayer in the database can have is useful, but sometimes it is simpler to provide an example.

Please feel free to submit a pull request if you have code thatyou wish to contribute - I would thoroughly appreciate the helping hand. For any code contributions, the best method is to[open a new GitHub pull request](https://github.com/0xNeffarion/osrsreboxed-db/pulls) in the project repository.### Crowd Sourcing Item Skill RequirementsA really manual part of the item database is the `item.equipment.requirements` data. So far, I have manually populated this data... for over 3,500items! To keep this project alive, I have stopped adding in this data (as it takes a lot of time). Here is a summary of how the item skillrequirements work:-   All item requirements are stored in the    [`skill-requirements.json`](https://github.com/osrsbox/osrsbox-db/blob/master/data/items/items-skill-requirements.json) file-   They have a structure of:```    &quot;item_id&quot;: {        &quot;skill_name&quot;: integer    },```-   For example, the Abyssal whip item:```    &quot;4151&quot;: {        &quot;attack&quot;: 70    },```-   For the `skill_name`, the    [`schema-items.json`](https://github.com/osrsbox/schemas/blob/67b062b8d8499f80f43a95ff3b72cc40a6a833c9/schema-items.json#L293) file has a list of    the allowed values - to help get the correct skill name. For example, `runecraft` and not `runecrafting`!With some community help (by crowd sourcing) we could keep this data point fresh. If you find an error or want to add in a requirement, and want tocontribute, here are the best ways to help:-   GitHub PR: Clone the project repo, make changes to `skill-requirements.json`, submit PR-   GitHub Issue: Submit an issue with the fix. It would really help me if you put the request in the correct JSON format as described above!## Additional Project InformationYou can find additional information on the original [osrsbox repository](https://github.com/osrsbox/osrsbox-db) or even at[osrsbox.com](https://www.osrsbox.com/).

Tools built on MythX integrateseamlessly into the development environments and continuous integrationpipelines used throughout the Ethereum ecosystem.Installation------------PythX runs on Python 3.6+ and PyPy3.To get started, simply run.. code-block:: console    $ pip3 install pythxAlternatively, clone the repository and run.. code-block:: console    $ pip3 install .Or directly through Python's :code:`setuptools`:.. code-block:: console    $ python3 setup.py installExample-------PythX aims to provide an easy-to-use interface to the official MythX_ API.Its goal is to turbocharge tool development and make it easy to deal witheven complex use cases... code-block:: python3    from pythx import Client    c = Client(api_key=&quot;...&quot;)    # submit bytecode, source files, their AST and more!    resp = c.analyze(bytecode=&quot;0xfe&quot;)    # wait for the analysis to finish    while not c.analysis_ready(resp.uuid):        time.sleep(1)    # have all your security report data at your fingertips    for issue in c.report(resp.uuid):        print(issue.swc_title or &quot;Undefined&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, issue.description_short)    # Output:    # Assert Violation - A reachable exception has been detected.The PythX CLI has now become the MythX CLI!-------------------------------------------Originally, the PythX CLI was a proof of concept to display to interesteddevelopers what can be done using the library. The interest in the CLI grewso large that a lot of developers contacted me and asked for support andnew features.This is the PSA that **I will no longer maintain the PythX CLI**. But wait!There's more!Because a PoC is not exactly what you would call future-proof and maintainablesoftware, I have decided to do a complete revamp. It is called `mythx-cli` andincorporates all feature requests I have gotten so far. Check it out`here &lt;https://github.com/dmuhs/mythx-cli/&gt;`_ and let me know what you think!Enjoy! :).. _MythX: https://mythx.io/=======History=======1.6.1 [2020-06-16]------------------- Update :code:`mythx-models` dependency to omit stale warning1.6.0 [2020-06-16]------------------- Disable model json schema validation and tests- Various dependency upgrades1.5.7 [2020-04-27]------------------- Add property checking middleware and tests- Various dependency upgrades1.5.6 [2020-04-21]------------------- Various critical dependency upgrades- Fix bug where tests failed due to a data mismatch1.5.5 [2020-02-24]------------------- Allow direct injection of domain model into client analyze method1.5.4 [2020-02-20]------------------- Fix various dependency conflicts- Add better documentation to readme file- Update middleware type hints and documentation- Update API module type hints and documentation- Various dependency upgrades1.5.3 [2020-02-10]------------------- Handle ambiguous :code:`MYTHX_API_URL` declarations- Various dependency upgrades1.5.2 [2020-01-30]------------------- Add additional analysis/group list filter parameters- Various dependency upgrades1.5.1 [2020-01-29]------------------- Remove trial user support as it has been dropped from the API1.5.0 [2020-01-29]------------------- Add pypy3 tests in Travis CI- Add additional query param support to analysis list handler- Add various test suite improvements- Drop support for Python 3.5 and add support for Python 3.8- Remove stale parameter config options- Remove stale configuration object support- Improve PyPI trove classifiers- Various dependency upgrades1.4.1 [2019-11-19]------------------- Extend status code range for failure check in API handler1.4.0 [2019-11-19]------------------- Fix bug where empty query parameters were sent to the API- Introduce group ID/name middleware- Add group status support in client- Add group creation/sealing support in client- Add group list support in client- Fix dependency conflict between :code:`mythx-cli` and :code:`mythx-models`- Various dependency upgrades1.3.2 [2019-10-04]------------------- Update :code:`mythx-models` to 1.4.11.3.1 [2019-10-04]------------------- Update pytest from 5.1.2 to 5.2.0- Update :code:`mythx-models` to 1.4.01.3.0 [2019-09-20]------------------- Remove the PythX CLI PoC- Add PSA about deprecation and link to new :code:`mythx-cli` repository1.2.6 [2019-09-19]------------------- Update twine from 1.14.0 to 1.15.0- Bump :code:`mythx-models` to 1.3.51.2.5 [2019-09-15]------------------- Update twine from 1.13.0 to 1.14.0- Clean up dependencies- Bump :code:`mythx-models` to 1.3.31.2.4 [2019-09-06]------------------- Bump :code:`mythx-models` to 1.3.2- Add support to fetch analysis result input by UUID1.2.3 [2019-09-05]------------------- Add an auth check override to handle situations where only the access token is given1.2.2 [2019-08-30]------------------- Update :code:`mythx-models` to 1.3.11.2.1 [2019-08-29]------------------- Update :code:`mythx-models` to 1.3.01.2.0 [2019-08-26]------------------- Add `mythx-models &lt;https://github.com/dmuhs/mythx-models&gt;`_ integration1.1.8 [2019-06-05]------------------- Add debug flag to CLI- Add support for the :code:`clientToolName` response field- Add support for the new source list format validation- Update the bumpversion expression to support black formatting1.1.7 [2019-04-20]------------------- Add main docstring description1.1.6 [2019-04-19]------------------- Add :code:`mainSource` support to CLI- Fix bug where submission object was malformed (&quot;AST&quot; -&gt; &quot;ast&quot;)- Upgrade pytest dependency1.1.5 [2019-04-16]------------------- Add middleware to disable analysis cache- Add CLI support to analyze compiled Truffle projects- Fix bug where reports were not completely shown- Update the authentication data format- Add support for the mainSource field- Add shortcut to inject middlewares in Client1.1.4 [2019-03-28]------------------- Fix issue in schema detection- Upgrade Sphinx dependency1.1.3 [2019-03-25]------------------- Initial release!- 100% branch coverage achieved- 100% doc coverage achieved- Examples provided in repo readme- Automatic PyPI deployment on version tag change</longdescription>

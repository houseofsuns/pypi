This lets you re-use your existing CI/CD infrastructure anddeployment practices.- Watergrid encourages you to write your ETL operations as modular &quot;steps&quot;,making it easy to isolate and test atomic parts of your pipelines.- Watergrid lets you scale up to multi-node clusters by changing only a fewlines of Python code.- Watergrid is minimalistic, and easy to use.- Watergrid does not depend on complicated software setups that execute jobs.Everything is self-contained in the library itself.- Watergrid lets you use your existing Redis infrastructure for distributedjobs instead of a proprietary data storage/transmission solution.- Watergrid includes an API for interfacing with an APM of your choice out ofthe box.## Getting StartedCreating an ETL pipeline with Watergrid is very easy.1. Install Python 3.6 or later (other versions may be supported, but are not tested regularly).1. Run `pip install watergrid`1. Paste the following code into a file named `main.py`:```pythonfrom watergrid.pipelines.standalone_pipeline import StandalonePipelinefrom watergrid.steps import Stepfrom watergrid.context import DataContextclass SampleStep(Step):    def __init__(self):        super().__init__(self.__class__.__name__)    def run(self, context: DataContext):        print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)def main():   pipeline = StandalonePipeline('hello_world_pipeline')   pipeline.add_step(SampleStep())   while True:    pipeline.run()if __name__ == '__main__':   main()```Then run `python main.py` to run the pipeline. You should see Hello World!printed to the console.Check out the [getting started section of the documentation site](https://armmaster17.github.io/watergrid-python/getting_started.html)to build more advanced pipelines with multiple steps and high-availability.## Getting HelpThere are plenty of places to get help with Watergrid.- Check the in-line documentation in the Python source.- Read the online documentation on [GitHub Pages](https://armmaster17.github.io/watergrid-python/index.html).- Make a post in the [Discussions Tab](https://github.com/ARMmaster17/watergrid-python/discussions).- Open an issue if you think the problem is with Watergrid, or if you have afeature to suggest.## Example Projects- [RSSMQ](https://github.com/ARMmaster17/rssmq/tree/126-refactor-to-use-watergrid) - Forwards RSS feed items to various HTTP APIs.- [atc-metrics-streamer](https://github.com/ARMmaster17/atc-metrics-streamer) - Streams metrics from Apache Traffic Control to Kafka.</longdescription>

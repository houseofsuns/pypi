Check the example file included in the package.CACHE MANAGEMENT================`OpenStack Object Storage (Swift)`_ is an object storage and not a real file system.This proxy simulates enough file system functionality to be used over FTP, but ithas a performance impact.To improve the performance a cache is used. It can be local or external (withMemcache). By default a local cache is used, unless one or more Memcache serversare configured.If you're using just one client the local cache may be fine, but if you're usingseveral connections, configuring an external cache is highly recommended.If an external cache is available it will be used to cache authentication tokens tooso any Memcache server must be secured to prevent unauthorized access as it could bepossible to associate a token with a specific user (not trivial) or even use thecache key (MD5 hash) to brute-force the user password.OPENSTACK IDENTITY SERVICE (KEYSTONE)=====================================By default ftp-cloudfs will use Swift auth 1.0, that is compatible with `OpenStack Object Storage`using `swauth`_ auth middleware and Swift implementations such as `Rackspace Cloud Files` or`Memset's Memstore Cloud Storage`.Optionally `OpenStack Identity Service`_ (Keystone) v2.0 or v3 can be used.Currently python-keystoneclient (0.3.2+ recommended) is required to use Keystone authand it can be enabled with ``keystone-auth`` option.With Keystone v2.0, you can provide a tenant name in the FTP login user withTENANT.USERNAME (using a dot as separator).With Keystone v3, you can also provide domain name in the FTP login user with`PROJECT_NAME@PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME.USERNAME@USER_DOMAIN_NAME` (using @ as a separator).Please check the example configuration file for further details... _swauth: https://github.com/gholt/swauth.. _OpenStack Identity Service: https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/identity/index.html.. _RackSpace Cloud Files: http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/files/.. _Memset's Memstore Cloud Storage: https://www.memset.com/cloud/storage/LARGE FILE SUPPORT==================The object storage has a limit on the size of a single uploaded object (by default this is 5GB).Files larger than that can be split in parts and merged back on the fly using a manifest file.ftp-cloudfs supports this transparently with the *split-large-files* configuration token, settingit to the number of megabytes wanted to use for each part (disabled by default).When a *FILE* is larger than the specified amount of MB, a *FILE.part* directory will be created and*n* parts will be created splitting the file automatically. The original file name will be used tostore the manifest. If the original file is downloaded, the parts will be served as it was a single file.The *FILE.part* directory can be removed from directory listings using the *hide-part-dir* configurationtoken. Please be aware that the directory will still be visible when accessing the storage usingswift API.STORAGE POLICIES================Swift storage policies may be used to add some level of segmentation inside a single Swift cluster :durability levels (Replication / Erasure Coding), storage backend performance (SSD vs HDD), ...With storage_policy paramter, you can restrict user access to a single policy : If no name is specified,the default policy is used (and if no other policies, defined Policy-0 is considered the default).Policy-0 is what is used by Swift when accessing pre-storage-policy containers which won’t have a policy.See `Openstack Storage Policies` for implementation details... _Openstack Storage Policies: https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/overview_policies.htmlSUPPORT=======The project website is at:https://github.com/cloudfs/ftp-cloudfs/issuesThere you can file bug reports, ask for help or contribute patches.

Whenyou run `pip freeze`, you'll get a list of all packages installed,with all dependencies. If one of the packages you installed ceases todepend on an already installed package, you have to manually remove itfrom the list. The list also makes no distinction about the packagesyou actually care about and packages your packages care about, makingthe requirements file bloated and, ultimately, inaccurate.On your terminal, run:: $ pip-chill asciitree==0.3.1 autopep8==1.2.4 beautifulsoup4==4.4.0 bleach==1.4.1 cookiecutter==1.4.0 coverage==3.7.1 django-argonauts==1.0.1 ...Or, if you want it without version numbers:: $ pip-chill --no-version asciitree autopep8 beautifulsoup4 bleach cookiecutter coverage django-argonauts ...Or, if you want to list package dependencies too:: $ pip-chill -v asciitree==0.3.1 autopep8==1.2.4 beautifulsoup4==4.4.0 bleach==1.4.1 cookiecutter==1.4.0 coverage==3.7.1 django-argonauts==1.0.1 # arrow==0.10.0 # Installed as dependency for jinja2-time # binaryornot==0.4.4 # Installed as dependency for cookiecutter # chardet==3.0.4 # Installed as dependency for binaryornot # click==6.7 # Installed as dependency for cookiecutter # django==1.11.5 # Installed as dependency for django-argonauts # future==0.16.0 # Installed as dependency for cookiecutter # html5lib==0.999999999 # Installed as dependency for bleach # jinja2==2.9.6 # Installed as dependency for jinja2-time, cookiecutter # jinja2-time==0.2.0 # Installed as dependency for cookiecutter # markupsafe==1.0 # Installed as dependency for jinja2 # pep8==1.7.0 # Installed as dependency for autopep8 # poyo==0.4.1 # Installed as dependency for cookiecutter # python-dateutil==2.6.1 # Installed as dependency for arrow # pytz==2017.2 # Installed as dependency for django # six==1.11.0 # Installed as dependency for python-dateutil, html5lib, bleach # webencodings==0.5.1 # Installed as dependency for html5lib # whichcraft==0.4.1 # Installed as dependency for cookiecutter ...Credits-------This package was created with Cookiecutter_ and the`audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`_ project template... _Cookiecutter: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter.. _`audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage=======History=======1.0.1 (2021-01-18)------------------* Add `no-chill` option so that pip-chill is not shown as installed* Do Linux tests on Focal where possible (2.7 and 3.7 on ppc64le and s390x, 2.7 on arm64 run Bionic)* Fix wrong URLs in CONTRIBUTING.rst* Add 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 to ppc64le and s390x, 3.10-dev to Linux, macOS* Rename nightly as 3.10-dev* Add explicit amd64 arch to amd64* Fix failing flake8 test* Bump version to 1.0.11.0.0 (2020-02-29)------------------* Remove dependency on Click (stay 100% within stdlib)* Add 3.8 tests for Tox* Add new tests* Add arm, ppc64le, and s390x to architectures being tested* Bump version to 1.0.00.1.9 (2019-07-23)------------------* New `-a` shortcut for `--all`* Internal fixes - use assert methods in tests, improve markdown.* Testing improvements (using TravisCI matrix, new base image, etc)* Small documentation improvements0.1.8 (2018-08-20)------------------* Fixes, compatibility with Python 2.7, 3.6, 3.70.1.7 (2018-01-22)------------------* Added a verbose command-line switch (fixed #3)0.1.6 (2016-11-23)------------------* Added pkg-resources to packages not shown by default.0.1.5 (2016-11-05)------------------* Added an --all switch.* Do not show wheel and setuptools unless --all is invoked.0.1.4 (2016-11-05)------------------* Better testing, more of the cookiecutter infrastructure enabled.0.1.3 (2016-10-06)------------------* Added a --no-version switch.0.1.0 (2016-10-03)------------------* First release on PyPI.</longdescription>

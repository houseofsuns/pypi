	<longdescription>================Yet Another Cron================A modern Cron replacement that is Docker-friendly* Free software: MIT licenseFeatures--------* &quot;Crontab&quot; is in YAML format;* Builtin sending of Sentry and Mail outputs when cron jobs fail;* Flexible configuration: you decide how to determine if a cron job fails or not;* Designed for running in Docker, Kubernetes, or 12 factor environments:  * Runs in the foreground;  * Logs everything to stdout/stderr [1]_;* Option to automatically retry failing cron jobs, with exponential backoff;* Optional HTTP REST API, to fetch status and start jobs on demand;* Arbitrary timezone support;.. [1] Whereas vixie cron only logs to syslog, requiring a syslog daemon to be running in the background or else you don't get logs!Status--------------The project is in beta stage: essential features are complete, and the focus isfinding and fixing bugs before the first stable release.Installation------------Install using pip+++++++++++++++++yacron requires Python &gt;= 3.6 (for systems with older Python, use the binary instead).  It is advisable to install it in a Pythonvirtual environment, for example:.. code-block:: shell    python3 -m venv yacronenv    . yacronenv/bin/activate    pip install yacronInstall using pipx++++++++++++++++++pipx_ automates creating a virtualenv and installing a python program in thenewly created virtualenv.  It is as simple as:.. code-block:: shell    pipx install yacron.. _pipx: https://github.com/pipxproject/pipxInstall using binary++++++++++++++++++++Alternatively, a self-contained binary can be downloadedfrom github: https://github.com/gjcarneiro/yacron/releases. This binary shouldwork on any Linux 64-bit system post glibc 2.23 (e.g. Ubuntu:16.04).  Python is not required on the target system (it is embedded in the executable).Usage-----Configuration is in YAML format.  To start yacron, give it a configuration fileor directory path as the ``-c`` argument.  For example::    yacron -c /tmp/my-crontab.yamlThis starts yacron (always in the foreground!), reading``/tmp/my-crontab.yaml`` as configuration file.  If the path is a directory,any ``*.yaml`` or ``*.yml`` files inside this directory are taken asconfiguration files.Configuration basics++++++++++++++++++++This configuration runs a command every 5 minutes:.. code-block:: yaml    jobs:      - name: test-01        command: echo &quot;foobar&quot;        shell: /bin/bash        schedule: &quot;*/5 * * * *&quot;The command can be a string or a list of strings.  If command is a string,yacron runs it through a shell, which is ``/bin/bash`` in the above example, butis ``/bin/sh`` by default.If the command is a list of strings, the command is executed directly, without ashell.  The ARGV of the command to execute is extracted directly from theconfiguration:.. code-block:: yaml    jobs:      - name: test-01        command:          - echo          - foobar        schedule: &quot;*/5 * * * *&quot;The `schedule` option can be a string in a crontab format specified by https://github.com/josiahcarlson/parse-crontab (this module is used by yacron).Additionally @reboot can be included , which will only run the job when yacron is initiallyexecuted. Further `schedule` can be an object with properties.  The following configurationruns a command every 5 minutes, but only on the specific date 2017-07-19, anddoesn't run it in any other date:.. code-block:: yaml    jobs:      - name: test-01        command: echo &quot;foobar&quot;        schedule:          minute: &quot;*/5&quot;          dayOfMonth: 19          month: 7          year: 2017          dayOfWeek: &quot;*&quot;Important: by default all time is interpreted to be in UTC, but you canrequest to use local time instead.  For instance, the cron job below runsevery day at 19h27 *local time* because of the ``utc: false`` option:.. code-block:: yaml  jobs:    - name: test-01      command: echo &quot;hello&quot;      schedule: &quot;27 19 * * *&quot;      utc: false      captureStdout: trueSince Yacron version 0.11, you can also request that the schedule beinterpreted in an arbitrary timezone, using the ``timezone`` attribute:.. code-block:: yaml  jobs:    - name: test-01      command: echo &quot;hello&quot;      schedule: &quot;27 19 * * *&quot;      timezone: America/Los_Angeles      captureStdout: trueYou can ask for environment variables to be defined for command execution:.. code-block:: yaml    jobs:      - name: test-01        command: echo &quot;foobar&quot;        shell: /bin/bash        schedule: &quot;*/5 * * * *&quot;        environment:          - key: PATH            value: /bin:/usr/binYou can also provide an environment file to define environments for command execution:.. code-block:: yaml    jobs:      - name: test-01        command: echo &quot;foobar&quot;        shell: /bin/bash        schedule: &quot;*/5 * * * *&quot;        env_file: .envThe env file must be a list of ``KEY=VALUE`` pairs. Empty lines and lines starting with ``#`` will be ignored.Variables declared in the ``environment`` option will override those found in the ``env_file``.Specifying defaults+++++++++++++++++++There can be a special ``defaults`` section in the config.  Any attributesdefined in this section provide default values for cron jobs to inherit.Although cron jobs can still override the defaults, as needed:.. code-block:: yaml    defaults:        environment:          - key: PATH            value: /bin:/usr/bin        shell: /bin/bash        utc: false    jobs:      - name: test-01        command: echo &quot;foobar&quot;  # runs with /bin/bash as shell        schedule: &quot;*/5 * * * *&quot;      - name: test-02  # runs with /bin/sh as shell        command: echo &quot;zbr&quot;        shell: /bin/sh        schedule: &quot;*/5 * * * *&quot;Note: if the configuration option is a directory and there are multiple configuration files in that directory, then the ``defaults`` section in each configuration file provides default options only for cron jobs inside that same file; the defaults have no effect beyond any individual YAML file.Reporting+++++++++Yacron has builtin support for reporting jobs failure (more on that below) byemail, Sentry and shell command (additional reporting methods might be added in the future):.. code-block:: yaml  - name: test-01    command: |      echo &quot;hello&quot; 1&gt;&amp;2      sleep 1      exit 10    schedule:      minute: &quot;*/2&quot;    captureStderr: true    onFailure:      report:        sentry:          dsn:            value: example            # Alternatively:            # fromFile: /etc/secrets/my-secret-dsn            # fromEnvVar: SENTRY_DSN          fingerprint:  # optional, since yacron 0.6            - yacron            - &quot;{{ environment.HOSTNAME }}&quot;            - &quot;{{ name }}&quot;          extra:            foo: bar            zbr: 123          level: warning          environment: production        mail:          from: example@foo.com          to: example@bar.com          smtpHost: 127.0.0.1          # optional fields:          username: &quot;username1&quot;  # set username and password to enable login          password:            value: example            # Alternatively:            # fromFile: /etc/secrets/my-secret-password            # fromEnvVar: MAIL_PASSWORD          tls: false  # set to true to enable TLS          starttls: false  # set to true to enable StartTLS        shell:          shell: /bin/bash          command: ...Here, the ``onFailure`` object indicates that what to do when a job failureis detected.  In this case we ask for it to be reported both to sentry and bysending an email.The ``captureStderr: true`` part instructs yacron to capture output from the theprogram's `standard error`, so that it can be included in the report.  We couldalso turn on `standard output` capturing via the ``captureStdout: true`` option.By default, yacron captures only standard error.  If a cron job's standard erroror standard output capturing is not enabled, these streams will simply write tothe same standard output and standard error as yacron itself.Both `stdout` and `stderr` stream lines are by default prefixed with``[{job_name} {stream_name}]``, i.e. ``[test-01 stdout]``, if for any reason youneed to change this, provide the option ``streamPrefix`` (new in version 0.16)with your own custom string... code-block:: yaml  - name: test-01    command: echo &quot;hello world&quot;    schedule:      minute: &quot;*/2&quot;    captureStdout: true    streamPrefix: &quot;[{job_name} job]&quot;In some cases, for instance when you're logging JSON objects you might want tocompletely get rid of the prefix altogether:.. code-block:: yaml  - name: test-01    command: echo &quot;hello world&quot;    schedule:      minute: &quot;*/2&quot;    captureStdout: true    streamPrefix: &quot;&quot;It is possible also to report job success, as well as failure, via the``onSuccess`` option... code-block:: yaml  - name: test-01    command: echo &quot;hello world&quot;    schedule:      minute: &quot;*/2&quot;    captureStdout: true    onSuccess:      report:        mail:          from: example@foo.com          to: example@bar.com          smtpHost: 127.0.0.1Since yacron 0.5, it is possible to customise the format of the report. For``mail`` reporting, the option ``subject`` indicates what is the subject of theemail, while ``body`` formats the email body.  For Sentry reporting, there isonly ``body``.  In all cases, the values of those options are strings that areprocessed by the jinja2_ templating engine.  The following variables areavailable in templating:* name(str): name of the cron job* success(bool): whether or not the cron job succeeded* stdout(str): standard output of the process* stderr(str): standard error of the process* exit_code(int): process exit code* command(str): cron job command* shell(str): cron job shell* environment(dict): subprocess environment variables.. _jinja2: http://jinja.pocoo.org/Example:.. code-block:: yaml  - name: test-01    command: |      echo &quot;hello&quot; 1&gt;&amp;2      sleep 1      exit 10    schedule:      minute: &quot;*/2&quot;    captureStderr: true    onFailure:      report:        mail:          from: example@foo.com          to: example@bar.com          smtpHost: 127.0.0.1          subject: Cron job '{{name}}' {% if success %}completed{% else %}failed{% endif %}          body: |            {{stderr}}            (exit code: {{exit_code}})The shell reporter (since yacron 0.13) executes a user given shell command inthe specified shell. It passes all environment variables from the pythonexecutable and specifies some additional ones to inform about the state of thejob:* YACRON_FAIL_REASON (str)* YACRON_FAILED (&quot;1&quot; or &quot;0&quot;)* YACRON_JOB_NAME (str)* YACRON_JOB_COMMAND (str)* YACRON_JOB_SCHEDULE (str)* YACRON_RETCODE (str)* YACRON_STDERR (str)* YACRON_STDOUT (str)A simple example configuration:.. code-block:: yaml  - name: test-01    command: echo &quot;foobar&quot; &amp;&amp; exit 123    shell: /bin/bash    schedule: &quot;* * * * *&quot;    onFailure:      report:        shell:          shell: /bin/bash          command: echo &quot;Error code $YACRON_RETCODE&quot;Since yacron 0.15, it is possible to send emails formatted as html, by  addingthe ``html: true`` property.  For example, here the standard output of a shellcommand is captured and interpreted as html and placed in the email message\:.. code-block:: yaml  - name: test-01    command: echo &quot;hello &lt;b&gt;world&lt;/b&gt;&quot;    schedule: &quot;@reboot&quot;    captureStdout: true    onSuccess:      report:        mail:          from: example@foo.com          to: example@bar.com, zzz@sleep.com          html: true          smtpHost: 127.0.0.1          smtpPort: 1025          subject: This is a cron job with html bodyMetrics+++++++++Yacron has builtin support for writing job metrics to Statsd_:.. _Statsd: https://github.com/etsy/statsd.. code-block:: yaml    jobs:      - name: test01        command: echo &quot;hello&quot;        schedule: &quot;* * * * *&quot;        statsd:          host: my-statsd.example.com          port: 8125          prefix: my.cron.jobs.prefix.test01With this config Yacron will write the following metrics over UDPto the Statsd listening on ``my-statsd.example.com:8125``:.. code-block::  my.cron.jobs.prefix.test01.start:1|g  # this one is sent when the job starts  my.cron.jobs.prefix.test01.stop:1|g   # the rest are sent when the job stops  my.cron.jobs.prefix.test01.success:1|g  my.cron.jobs.prefix.test01.duration:3|ms|@0.1Handling failure++++++++++++++++By default, yacron considers that a job has `failed` if either the processreturns a non-zero code or if it generates output to `standard error` (andstandard error capturing is enabled, of course).You can instruct yacron how to determine if a job has failed or not via the``failsWhen`` option:.. code-block:: yaml  failsWhen:    producesStdout: false    producesStderr: true    nonzeroReturn: true    always: falseproducesStdout    If true, any captured standard output causes yacron to consider the job    as failed.  This is false by default.producesStderr    If true, any captured standard error causes yacron to consider the job    as failed.  This is true by default.nonzeroReturn    If true, if the job process returns a code other than zero causes yacron    to consider the job as failed.  This is true by default.always    If true, if the job process exits that causes yacron to consider the job as    failed.  This is false by default.It is possible to instruct yacron to retry failing cron jobs by adding a``retry`` option inside ``onFailure``:.. code-block:: yaml  - name: test-01    command: |      echo &quot;hello&quot; 1&gt;&amp;2      sleep 1      exit 10    schedule:      minute: &quot;*/10&quot;    captureStderr: true    onFailure:      report:        mail:          from: example@foo.com          to: example@bar.com          smtpHost: 127.0.0.1      retry:        maximumRetries: 10        initialDelay: 1        maximumDelay: 30        backoffMultiplier: 2The above settings tell yacron to retry the job up to 10 times, with the delaybetween retries defined by an exponential backoff process: initially 1 second,doubling for every retry up to a maximum of 30 seconds. A value of -1 formaximumRetries will mean yacron will keep retrying forever, this is mostlyuseful with a schedule of &quot;@reboot&quot; to restart a long running process when ithas failed.If the cron job is expected to fail sometimes, you may wish to report only inthe case the cron job ultimately fails after all retries and we give up on it.For that situation, you can use the ``onPermanentFailure`` option:.. code-block:: yaml  - name: test-01    command: |      echo &quot;hello&quot; 1&gt;&amp;2      sleep 1      exit 10    schedule:      minute: &quot;*/10&quot;    captureStderr: true    onFailure:      retry:        maximumRetries: 10        initialDelay: 1        maximumDelay: 30        backoffMultiplier: 2    onPermanentFailure:      report:        mail:          from: example@foo.com          to: example@bar.com          smtpHost: 127.0.0.1Concurrency+++++++++++Sometimes it may happen that a cron job takes so long to execute that when the moment its next scheduled execution is reached a previous instance may still be running.  How yacron handles this situation is controlled by the option ``concurrencyPolicy``, which takes one of the following values:Allow    allows concurrently running jobs (default)Forbid    forbids concurrent runs, skipping next run if previous hasn’t finished yetReplace    cancels currently running job and replaces it with a new oneExecution timeout+++++++++++++++++(new in version 0.4)If you have a cron job that may possibly hang sometimes, you can instruct yacronto terminate the process after N seconds if it's still running by then, via the``executionTimeout`` option.  For example, the following cron job takes 2seconds to complete, yacron will terminate it after 1 second:.. code-block:: yaml  - name: test-03    command: |      echo &quot;starting...&quot;      sleep 2      echo &quot;all done.&quot;    schedule:      minute: &quot;*&quot;    captureStderr: true    executionTimeout: 1  # in secondsWhen terminating a job, it is always a good idea to give that job process sometime to terminate properly.  For example, it may have opened a file, and even ifyou tell it to shutdown, the process may need a few seconds to flush buffers andavoid losing data.On the other hand, there are times when programs are buggy and simply get stuck,refusing to terminate nicely no matter what.  For this reason, yacron alwayschecks if a process exited some time after being asked to do so. If it hasn't,it tries to forcefully kill the process.  The option ``killTimeout`` optionindicates how many seconds to wait for the process to gracefully terminatebefore killing it more forcefully.  In Unix systems, we first send a SIGTERM,but if the process doesn't exit after ``killTimeout`` seconds (30 by default)then we send SIGKILL.  For example, this cron job ignores SIGTERM, and so yacronwill send it a SIGKILL after half a second:.. code-block:: yaml  - name: test-03    command: |      trap &quot;echo '(ignoring SIGTERM)'&quot; TERM      echo &quot;starting...&quot;      sleep 10      echo &quot;all done.&quot;    schedule:      minute: &quot;*&quot;    captureStderr: true    executionTimeout: 1    killTimeout: 0.5Change to another user/group++++++++++++++++++++++++++++(new in version 0.11)You can request that Yacron change to another user and/or group for a specificcron job.  The field ``user`` indicates the user (uid or userame) under whichthe subprocess must be executed.  The field ``group`` (gid or group name)indicates the group id.  If only ``user`` is given, the group defaults to themain group of that user.  Example:.. code-block:: yaml  - name: test-03    command: id    schedule:      minute: &quot;*&quot;    captureStderr: true    user: www-dataNaturally, yacron must be running as root in order to have permissions tochange to another user.Remote web/HTTP interface+++++++++++++++++++++++++(new in version 0.10)If you wish to remotely control yacron, you can optionally enable an HTTP RESTinterface, with the following configuration (example):.. code-block:: yaml  web:    listen:       - http://127.0.0.1:8080       - unix:///tmp/yacron.sockNow you have the following options to control it (using HTTPie as example):Get the version of yacron:##########################.. code-block:: shell  $ http get http://127.0.0.1:8080/version  HTTP/1.1 200 OK  Content-Length: 22  Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8  Date: Sun, 03 Nov 2019 19:48:15 GMT  Server: Python/3.7 aiohttp/3.6.2  0.10.0b3.dev7+g45bc4ceGet the status of cron jobs:############################.. code-block:: shell  $ http get http://127.0.0.1:8080/status  HTTP/1.1 200 OK  Content-Length: 104  Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8  Date: Sun, 03 Nov 2019 19:44:45 GMT  Server: Python/3.7 aiohttp/3.6.2  test-01: scheduled (in 14 seconds)  test-02: scheduled (in 74 seconds)  test-03: scheduled (in 14 seconds)You may also get status info in json format:.. code-block:: shell  $ http get http://127.0.0.1:8080/status Accept:application/json  HTTP/1.1 200 OK  Content-Length: 206  Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8  Date: Sun, 03 Nov 2019 19:45:53 GMT  Server: Python/3.7 aiohttp/3.6.2  [      {          &quot;job&quot;: &quot;test-01&quot;,          &quot;scheduled_in&quot;: 6.16588,          &quot;status&quot;: &quot;scheduled&quot;      },      {          &quot;job&quot;: &quot;test-02&quot;,          &quot;scheduled_in&quot;: 6.165787,          &quot;status&quot;: &quot;scheduled&quot;      },      {          &quot;job&quot;: &quot;test-03&quot;,          &quot;scheduled_in&quot;: 6.165757,          &quot;status&quot;: &quot;scheduled&quot;      }  ]Start a job right now:######################Sometimes it's useful to start a cron job right now, even if it's notscheduled to run yet, for example for testing:.. code-block:: shell  $ http post http://127.0.0.1:8080/jobs/test-02/start  HTTP/1.1 200 OK  Content-Length: 0  Content-Type: application/octet-stream  Date: Sun, 03 Nov 2019 19:50:20 GMT  Server: Python/3.7 aiohttp/3.6.2Includes++++++++(new in version 0.13)You may have a use case where it's convenient to have multiple config files,and choose at runtime which one to use.  In that case, it might be useful ifyou can put common definitions (such as defaults for reporting, shell, etc.)in a separate file, that is included by the other files.To support this use case, it is possible to ask one config file to includeanother one, via the ``include`` directive.  It takes a list of file names:those files will be parsed as configuration and merged in with this file.Example, your main config file could be:.. code-block:: yaml  include:    - _inc.yaml  jobs:    - name: my job      ...And your included ``_inc.yaml`` file could contain some useful defaults:.. code-block:: yaml  defaults:    shell: /bin/bash    onPermanentFailure:      report:        sentry:          ...Custom logging++++++++++++++It's possible to provide a custom logging configuration, via the ``logging``configuration section.  For example, the following configuration displays log lines withan embedded timestamp for each message... code-block:: yaml    logging:      # In the format of:      # https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.config.html#dictionary-schema-details      version: 1      disable_existing_loggers: false      formatters:        simple:          format: '%(asctime)s [%(processName)s/%(threadName)s] %(levelname)s (%(name)s): %(message)s'      handlers:        console:          class: logging.StreamHandler          level: DEBUG          formatter: simple          stream: ext://sys.stdout      root:        level: INFO        handlers:          - consoleObscure configuration options+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++enabled: true|false (default true)##################################(new in yacron 0.18)It is possible to disable a specific cron job by adding a `enabled: false` option.  Jobswith `enabled: false` will simply be skipped, as if they aren't there, apart fromvalidating the configuration... code-block:: yaml    jobs:      - name: test-01        enabled: false  # this cron job will not run until you change this to `true`        command: echo &quot;foobar&quot;        shell: /bin/bash        schedule: &quot;* * * * *&quot;=======History=======0.19.0 (2023-03-11)-------------------* Add ability to configure yacron's own logging (#81 #82 #83, gjcarneiro, bdamian)* Add config value for SMTP(validate_certs=False) (David Batley)0.18.0 (2023-01-01)-------------------* fixes &quot;Job is always executed immediately on yacron start&quot; (#67)* add an `enabled` option in jobs (#73)* give a better error message when no configuration file is provided or exists (#72)0.17.0 (2022-06-26)-------------------* Support Additional Shell Report Vars (RJ Garcia)* Shell reporter: handle long lines truncatation (Hannes Hergeth)* exe: undo pyinstaller LD_LIBRARY_PATH changes in subprocesses (#68, Gustavo Carneiro)0.16.0 (2021-12-05)-------------------* make the capture max line length configurable and change the default  from 64K to 16M (#56)* Add config option to change prefix of subprocess stream lines (#58, eelkeh)0.15.1 (2021-11-19)-------------------* Fix a bug in the --validate option (#57, Leonid Repin)0.15.0 (2021-11-10)-------------------* Allow emails to be html formatted* Fix an error when reading cmd output with huge lines (#56)0.14.0 (2021-10-04)-------------------* Sentry: increase the size of messages before getting truncated #54* Sentry: allow specifying the environment option #53* Minor fixes0.13.1 (2021-08-10)-------------------* unicode fixes for the exe binary version0.13.0 (2021-06-28)* Add ability for one config file to include another one #38* Add shell command reporting ability (Hannes Hergeth, #50)0.12.2 (2021-05-31)-------------------* constrain ruamel.yaml to version 0.17.4 or below, later versions are buggy0.12.1 (2021-05-30)-------------------* blacklist ruamel.yaml version 0.17.5 in requirements #470.12.0 (2021-04-22)-------------------* web: don't crash when receiving a web request without Accept header (#45)* add env_file configuration option (Alessandro Romani, #43)* email: add missing Date header (#39)0.11.2 (2020-11-29)-------------------* Add back a self contained binary, this time based on PyInstaller0.11.1 (2020-07-29)-------------------* Fix email reporting when multiple recipients given0.11.0 (2020-07-20)-------------------* reporting: add a failure reason line at the top of sentry/email (#36)* mail: new tls, startls, username, and password options (#21)* allow jobs to run as a different user (#18)* Support timezone schedule (#26)0.10.1 (2020-06-02)-------------------* Minor bugfixes0.10.0 (2019-11-03)-------------------* HTTP remote interface, allowing to get job status and start jobs on demand* Simple Linux binary including all dependencies (built using PyOxidizer)0.10.0b2 (2019-10-26)---------------------* Build Linux binary inside Docker Ubuntu 16.04, so that it is compatible with  older glibc systems0.10.0b1 (2019-10-13)---------------------* Build a standalone Linux binary, using PyOxidizer* Switch from raven to sentry-sdk0.9.0 (2019-04-03)------------------* Added an option to just check if the yaml file is valid without running the scheduler.* Fix missing `body` in the schema for sentry config0.8.1 (2018-10-16)------------------* Fix a bug handling ``@reboot`` in schedule (#22)0.8.0 (2018-05-14)------------------* Sentry: add new ``extra`` and ``level`` options.0.7.0 (2018-03-21)------------------* Added the ``utc`` option and document that times are utc by default (#17);* If an email body is empty, skip sending it;* Added docker and k8s example.0.6.0 (2017-11-24)------------------* Add custom Sentry fingerprint support* Ability to send job metrics to statsd (thanks bofm)* ``always`` flag to consider any cron job that exits to be failed  (thanks evanjardineskinner)* `maximumRetries` can now be ``-1`` to never stop retrying (evanjardineskinner)* ``schedule`` can be the string ``@reboot`` to always run that cron job on startup  (evanjardineskinner)* ``saveLimit`` can be set to zero (evanjardineskinner)0.5.0------------------* Templating support for reports* Remove deprecated smtp_host/smtp_port0.4.3 (2017-09-13)------------------* Bug fixes0.4.2 (2017-09-07)------------------* Bug fixes0.4.1 (2017-08-03)------------------* More polished handling of configuration errors;* Unit tests;* Bug fixes.0.4.0 (2017-07-24)------------------* New option ``executionTimeout``, to terminate jobs that get stuck;* If a job doesn't terminate gracefully kill it.

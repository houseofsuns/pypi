	<longdescription># sudo-win32This missing sudo command for win32. This is a thin wrapper over `gsudo`. Check out the excellent repo [here](https://github.com/gerardog/gsudo).The only benefit for this repo is that you don't need administrator privledges in order to use this tool, while usingsomething like choco install `gsudo` requires admin privledges. stderr/stdout and process return values are all supported.If you want to use `gsudo` directly, you can install it with `choco install gsudo`.The most recent `gsudo` version used is `2.0.4`[![Linting](https://github.com/zackees/sudo-win32/actions/workflows/lint.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/zackees/sudo-win32/actions/workflows/lint.yml)[![Tests](https://github.com/zackees/sudo-win32/actions/workflows/push_win.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/zackees/sudo-win32/actions/workflows/push_win.yml)# Usage```bash&gt; pip install sudo_win32[sudo]&gt; sudo taskkill /F /im wslservice.exe```If you omit [sudo] then the command will just be `sudo_win32`.# DocumentationThis is shamelessly ripped from the `gsudo` repo and is kept as-is. Simply replace `gsudo` with`sudo_win32` or `sudo` if you installed with the [sudo] extra. Otherwise it's the same.## Usage``` powershellgsudo [options]                  # Elevates your current shellgsudo [options] {command} [args] # Runs {command} with elevated permissionsgsudo cache [on | off | help]    # Starts/Stops a credentials cache session. (less UAC popups)gsudo status                     # Shows current user, cache and console status.gsudo !!                         # Re-run last command as admin. (YMMV)`````` powershellNew Window options: -n | --new            # Starts the command in a new console/window (and returns immediately). -w | --wait           # When in new console, wait for the command to end. --keepShell           # After running a command, keep the elevated shell open. --keepWindow          # After running a command in a new console, ask for keypress before closing the console/window.Security options: -u | --user {usr}     # Run as the specified user.

Warning: Verbose, interactive asks for credentials --copyev              # (deprecated) Copy environment variables to the elevated process. (not needed on default console mode)```**Note:** You can use anywhere **the `sudo` alias** created by the installers.**Examples:**``` powershellgsudo   # elevates the current shell in the current console window (Supports Cmd/PowerShell/Pwsh Core/Yori/Take Command/git-bash/cygwin)gsudo -n # launch the current shell elevated in a new console windowgsudo -n -w powershell ./Do-Something.ps1 # launch in new window and wait for exitgsudo notepad %windir%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts # launch windows appsudo notepad # sudo alias built-in# redirect/pipe input/output/error examplegsudo dir | findstr /c:&quot;bytes free&quot; &gt; FreeSpace.txtgsudo config LogLevel &quot;Error&quot;          # Configure Reduced logginggsudo config Prompt &quot;$P [elevated]$G &quot; # Configure a custom Elevated Promptgsudo config Prompt --reset            # Reset to default value# Enable credentials cache (less UAC popups):gsudo config CacheMode Auto```# DevelopmentTo develop software, run `. ./activate.sh`# WindowsThis environment requires you to use `git-bash`.# LintingRun `./lint.sh` to find linting errors using `pylint`, `flake8` and `mypy`.# Release Notes  * 1.0.9 - Allow strings or list[str] as command.  * 1.0.8 - Fixes some commands in admin mode.  * 1.0.7 - Use shell mode for gsudo, since it's a better experience. Commands are merged via subprocess.list2cmdline  * 1.0.6 - Switch the implementation to `gsudo`, which is excellent and does everything this lib needs.  * 1.0.5 - sudo-win32[sudo] now works correctly, before it was unconditionally installing.  * 1.0.3 - The stdout/stderr are now correct re-routed back.  * 1.0.2 - The return value of the command is now returned when elevating privledges.  * 1.0.1 - Fixing the readme  * 1.0.0 - Initial release</longdescription>

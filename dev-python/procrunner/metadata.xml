As a number of arguments  will be removed in a future version the use of unnamed arguments will  cause future confusion. `Use explicit keyword arguments instead (#62). &lt;https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/python-procrunner/pull/62&gt;`_* `The run() function debug argument has been deprecated (#63). &lt;https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/python-procrunner/pull/63&gt;`_  This is only used to debug the NonBlockingStream* classes. Those are due  to be replaced in a future release, so the argument will no longer serve  a purpose. Debugging information remains available via standard logging  mechanisms.* Final version supporting Python 3.52.1.0 (2020-09-05)------------------* `Deprecated array access on the return object (#60). &lt;https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/python-procrunner/pull/60&gt;`_  The return object will become a subprocess.CompletedProcess in a future  release, which no longer allows array-based access. For a translation table  of array elements to attributes please see the pull request linked above.* Add a `new parameter 'raise_timeout_exception' (#61). &lt;https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/python-procrunner/pull/61&gt;`_  When set to 'True' a subprocess.TimeoutExpired exception is raised when the  process runtime exceeds the timeout threshold. This defaults to 'False' and  will be set to 'True' in a future release.2.0.0 (2020-06-24)------------------* Python 3.5+ only, support for Python 2.7 has been dropped* Deprecated function alias run_process() has been removed* Fixed a stability issue on Windows1.1.0 (2019-11-04)------------------* Add Python 3.8 support, drop Python 3.4 support1.0.2 (2019-05-20)------------------* Stop environment override variables leaking into the process environment1.0.1 (2019-04-16)------------------* Minor fixes on the return object (implement equality,  mark as unhashable)1.0.0 (2019-03-25)------------------* Support file system path objects (PEP-519) in arguments* Change the return object to make it similar to  subprocess.CompletedProcess, introduced with Python 3.5+0.9.1 (2019-02-22)------------------* Have deprecation warnings point to correct code locations0.9.0 (2018-12-07)------------------* Trap UnicodeEncodeError when printing output. Offending characters  are replaced and a warning is logged once. Hints at incorrectly set  PYTHONIOENCODING.0.8.1 (2018-12-04)------------------* Fix a few deprecation warnings0.8.0 (2018-10-09)------------------* Add parameter working_directory to set the working directory  of the subprocess0.7.2 (2018-10-05)------------------* Officially support Python 3.70.7.1 (2018-09-03)------------------* Accept environment variable overriding with numeric values.0.7.0 (2018-05-13)------------------* Unicode fixes. Fix crash on invalid UTF-8 input.* Clarify that stdout/stderr values are returned as bytestrings.* Callbacks receive the data decoded as UTF-8 unicode strings  with unknown characters replaced by \ufffd (unicode replacement  character). Same applies to printing of output.* Mark stdin broken on Windows.0.6.1 (2018-05-02)------------------* Maintenance release to add some tests for executable resolution.0.6.0 (2018-05-02)------------------* Fix Win32 API executable resolution for commands containing a dot ('.') in  addition to a file extension (say '.bat').0.5.1 (2018-04-27)------------------* Fix Win32API dependency installation on Windows.0.5.0 (2018-04-26)------------------* New keyword 'win32resolve' which only takes effect on Windows and is enabled  by default. This causes procrunner to call the Win32 API FindExecutable()  function to try and lookup non-.exe files with the corresponding name. This  means .bat/.cmd/etc.. files can now be run without explicitly specifying  their extension. Only supported on Python 2.7 and 3.5+.0.4.0 (2018-04-23)------------------* Python 2.7 support on Windows. Python3 not yet supported on Windows.0.3.0 (2018-04-17)------------------* run_process() renamed to run()* Python3 compatibility fixes0.2.0 (2018-03-12)------------------* Procrunner is now Python3 3.3-3.6 compatible.0.1.0 (2018-03-12)------------------* First release on PyPI.</longdescription>

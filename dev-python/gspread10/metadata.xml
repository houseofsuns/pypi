	<longdescription># GSPREAD10![Sheets to Python](https://twilio-cms-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/original_images/python-and-sheets.png)# IntroductionThis is an python package which helps us to read the data of google spread sheets from your google drive and then you can manipulate the data using [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) and plot graph using [matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/)***## Features1. Easy to use2. Easy to understand3. Very helpful for reading the data from Google Sheets# Inside the PackageBefore installing this package there is one important thing which you have to do first. You have to enable your Google Drive API and Google Sheets API from [Google APIs Console](console.developers.google.com).## Steps to enable [Google Drive API](https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/drive/)1. Go to the [Google APIs Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).2. Create a new project.3. Click Enable API. Search for and enable the Google Drive API.4. Create credentials for a Web Server to access Application Data.5. Name the service account and grant it a Project Role of Editor.6. Download the [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) file.7. Give any specfic name of your [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) file8. Then Search [Google Sheets API](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api) and then click on enable.9. Open your [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) file and copy the client_email.10. Open your [GOOGLE SPREADSHEETS](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) and click on share button on the right top.11. Paste your client_email and then click on send button.# Code Description## Library UsedI have used the [gspread](https://pypi.org/project/gspread/) and [oauth2client](https://pypi.org/project/oauth2client/) service to authorize and make API calls to Google Cloud Services.### Importing Library```pythonpip install gspread oauth2clientpip install pandas```### Features of **`gspread`** library1. Google Sheets API v4.2. Open a spreadsheet by title, key or url.3. Read, write, and format cell ranges.4. Sharing and access control.5. Batching updates.### About **`oauth2client`**This library will help us to get the client credientials a to read the data of specific Spread Sheet.***# LET'S GET STARTED# How to Install```python pip install gspread10```The name of this package is &quot;gspread10&quot; and you can use this package to read the data from [GOODLE SPREADSHEETS](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) in [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) format and then using [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) you can manipulate the data in table using [DataFrames](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) and for Data Visualization you can use [Matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/).## Function to read the dataTo read the data from c you have to use `getjsonGspreadData(json_file, gspread_file)` function and inside the function you have to give the path of your [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) file and the name of your [GOODLE SPREADSHEETS](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/).For example:- I want to read the data from [Greendeck](https://www.greendeck.co/) Assignment file. So Here How it should be written.``` PythongetjsonGspreadData(&quot;your_JSON_Path&quot;, &quot;Greendeck Assignment&quot;)```# Code for Reading the file from [GOOGLE SPREADSHEETS](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/)```Python# Google Sheets Features.# Open a spreadsheet by title, key or url.# Read, write, and format cell ranges.# Sharing and access control.# Batching updates.# oauth2client library will help us to get the client credentials a to read the data of specific Spread Sheet.import gspreadfrom oauth2client.service_account import ServiceAccountCredentialsimport pandas as pddef getjsonGspreadData(json_file, gspread_file):    # use creds to create a client to interact with the Google Drive API    scope = [&quot;https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds&quot;,&quot;https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file&quot;,&quot;https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive&quot;]    creds = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name(json_file, scope)    client = gspread.authorize(creds)    # Find a workbook by name and open the first sheet    # Make sure you use the right name here.    sheet = client.open(gspread_file).sheet1    # Extract and print all of the values    list_of_gspread = sheet.get_all_records()    # return list_of_gspread    data = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(list_of_gspread)    return data# print(getjsonGspreadData(&quot;D:\\project videos\\Google sheets\\client_secret.json&quot;, &quot;Greendeck Assignment&quot;))```I went throung several websites to get the idea of 'How to read data from Google Spread Sheet'. So finally I got this website --&gt; [medium.com](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-read-and-write-data-to-google-spreadsheet-using-python-ebf54d51a72c).

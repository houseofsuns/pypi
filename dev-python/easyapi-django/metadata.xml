	<longdescription># easyapi-djangoA simple rest api generator for django based on modelsAPI in 4 easy steps!## Install```pip install easyapi-django```## Add middleware in Django settings```MIDDLEWARE = [    ...    'easyapi.ExceptionMiddleware',]```## Create Resource based on your model```from easyapi import BaseResourcefrom your_models import YOUR_DJANGO_MODELclass ResourceName(BaseResource):    model = YOUR_DJANGO_MODEL```## Add to your routes url```from easyapi.routes import get_routesfrom resourcefile import ResourceNameendpoints = {    'endpointname(.\*)$': ResourceName,}routes = get_routes(endpoints)urlpatterns = [    ...] + routes```Your api with GET, PUT, POST and DELETE is ready. Start using itHow easy and cool is that???## FREE Bonus features```class ResourceName(BaseResource):    model = YOUR_DJANGO_MODEL    # return list results normalized    normalize_list = True    # define methods allowed    allowed_methods = ['get', 'patch', 'post', 'delete']    # define fields returned in list, if not define all fields are returned    list_fields = ['field1', 'field2', 'field3']    # return normalized fields for related models in list    list_related_fields = {'field1': ['related_field1', 'related_field2']}    # define fields that are allowed to be filtered    filter_fields = [        'field1',        'field2'    ]    # define fields that are allowed to be searched    search_fields = ['field1', 'field2', 'field3']    # define fields that are allowed to be used in a order by    order_fields = ['field1', 'field2']    # define fields allowed to be updated    update_fields = [        'field1', 'field2'    ]    # define fields returned in a specific object    edit_fields = [        'field1', 'field2', 'field3', 'field3'    ]    # define operator for searches    search_operator = 'icontains'```### CountBy default in list calls, the api does not return the total of objects due to slow count in innodb tables used in MySql,but, it is very easy to get count objects simple add```?count=true```at your request. The api will return the total count of objects and will consider whatever filter or search applied```{    count: 90}```### SearchTo search you can use any field defined above in search_fields.The search will be applied in all fields defined using OR.By default all searches are made using icontains. You can change it for any allowed Django search operator.```?search=value```To change the search operator define it in you Resource Class```class ResourceName(BaseResource):    model = YOUR_DJANGO_MODEL    search_operator = 'icontains'```### FilterTo filter just use querystrings. The filter will only be applied in defined fields above in filter_fields.```?field_name=value?field_name__lte=value?field_name__startswith=value```you can filter using the following modifiers```__isnull|__gte|__lte|__lt|__gt|__startswith```You can combine filters, search and count in the same get. You can search and filter in related models/fields too.### PaginationYou have a free pagination system using easyapi. The default number of results is 25 and the default order uses id. You can change this values per Resource.```class ResourceName(BaseResource):    model = YOUR_DJANGO_MODEL    limit = 25    order_by = 'id'```If you set you limit to 0, all records will be returned.To paginate just add to your call```?page=value```you can chage the default values dinamically too:```?page=value&amp;limit=value&amp;order_by=(field_name|-field_name)```## Waittttt, there is more FREE BonusYou can add relative endpoints very easy, just add a new route and the funcion that you want to call with the allowed methods.In the examples below we are creating 2 endpoints routes: accept and refuse that will call 2 functions (accept and refuse) that should return a response.```class ResourceName(BaseResource):    model = YOUR_DJANGO_MODEL    routes = [            {                'path': r'(\d*)/accept$',                'func': 'accept',                'allowed_methods': ['patch']            },            {                'path': r'(\d*)/refuse$',                'func': 'refuse',                'allowed_methods': ['delete']            },    ]```</longdescription>

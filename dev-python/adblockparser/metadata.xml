Get filter rules somewhere: write them manually, read lines from a file   downloaded from EasyList_, etc.::       &gt;&gt;&gt; raw_rules = [       ...     &quot;||ads.example.com^&quot;,       ...     &quot;@@||ads.example.com/notbanner^$~script&quot;,       ... ]2. Create ``AdblockRules`` instance from rule strings::       &gt;&gt;&gt; from adblockparser import AdblockRules       &gt;&gt;&gt; rules = AdblockRules(raw_rules)3. Use this instance to check if an URL should be blocked or not::       &gt;&gt;&gt; rules.should_block(&quot;http://ads.example.com&quot;)       True   Rules with options are ignored unless you pass a dict with options values::       &gt;&gt;&gt; rules.should_block(&quot;http://ads.example.com/notbanner&quot;)       True       &gt;&gt;&gt; rules.should_block(&quot;http://ads.example.com/notbanner&quot;, {'script': False})       False       &gt;&gt;&gt; rules.should_block(&quot;http://ads.example.com/notbanner&quot;, {'script': True})       TrueConsult with Adblock Plus `docs &lt;https://adblockplus.org/en/filters#options&gt;`__for options description. These options allow to write filters that dependon some external information not available in URL itself.Performance-----------Regex engines^^^^^^^^^^^^^``AdblockRules`` class creates a huge regex to match filters thatdon't use options. pyre2_ library works better than stdlib's rewith such regexes. If you have pyre2_ installed then ``AdblockRules``should work faster, and the speedup can be dramatic - more than 1000xin some cases.Sometimes pyre2 prints something like``re2/dfa.cc:459: DFA out of memory: prog size 270515 mem 1713850`` to stderr.Give re2 library more memory to fix that::    &gt;&gt;&gt; rules = AdblockRules(raw_rules, use_re2=True, max_mem=512*1024*1024)  # doctest: +SKIPMake sure you are using re2 0.2.20 installed from PyPI, it doesn't work.Parsing rules with options^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Rules that have options are currently matched in a loop, one-by-one.Also, they are checked for compatibility with options passed by user:for example, if user didn't pass 'script' option (with a ``True`` or ``False``value), all rules involving ``script`` are discarded.This is slow if you have thousands of such rules. To make it work faster,explicitly list all options you want to support in ``AdblockRules`` constructor,disable skipping of unsupported rules, and always pass a dict with all optionsto ``should_block`` method::    &gt;&gt;&gt; rules = AdblockRules(    ...    raw_rules,    ...    supported_options=['script', 'domain'],    ...    skip_unsupported_rules=False    ... )    &gt;&gt;&gt; options = {'script': False, 'domain': 'www.mystartpage.com'}    &gt;&gt;&gt; rules.should_block(&quot;http://ads.example.com/notbanner&quot;, options)    FalseThis way rules with unsupported options will be filtered once, when``AdblockRules`` instance is created.Limitations-----------There are some known limitations of the current implementation:* element hiding rules are ignored;* matching URLs against a large number of filters can be slow-ish,  especially if pyre2_ is not installed and many filter options are enabled;* ``match-case`` filter option is not properly supported (it is ignored);* ``document`` filter option is not properly supported;* rules are not validated *before* parsing, so invalid rules may raise  inconsistent exceptions or silently work incorrectly.It is possible to remove all these limitations. Pull requests are welcomeif you want to make it happen sooner!Contributing------------* source code: https://github.com/scrapinghub/adblockparser* issue tracker: https://github.com/scrapinghub/adblockparser/issuesIn order to run tests, install `tox &lt;http://tox.testrun.org&gt;`_ and type::    toxfrom the source checkout.The license is MIT.Changes=======0.7 (2016-10-17)----------------* Fixed parsing issue with recent easylist.txt;* fixed a link to easylist (thanks https://github.com/limonte).0.6 (2016-09-10)----------------* Added support for regex rules (thanks https://github.com/mlyko).0.5 (2016-03-04)----------------* Fixed an issue with blank lines in filter files  (thanks https://github.com/skrypka);* fixed an issue with applying rules with 'domain' option  when domain doesn't have a dot (e.g. 'localhost');* Python 2.6 and Python 3.2 support is dropped;  adblockparser likely still work in these interpreters,  but this is no longer checked by tests.0.4 (2015-03-29)----------------* AdblockRule now caches the compiled regexes (thanks  https://github.com/mozbugbox);* Fixed an issue with &quot;domain&quot; option handling  (thanks https://github.com/nbraem for the bug report and a test case);* cleanups and test improvements.0.3 (2014-07-11)----------------* Switch to setuptools;* better ``__repr__`` for ``AdblockRule``;* Python 3.4 support is confirmed;* testing improvements.0.2 (2014-03-20)----------------This release provides much faster `AdblockRules.should_block()` methodfor rules without options and rules with 'domain' option.* better combined regex for option-less rules that makes re2 library  always use DFA without falling back to NFA;* an index for rules with domains;* ``params`` method arguments are renamed to ``options`` for consistency.0.1.1 (2014-03-11)------------------By default ``AdblockRules`` autodetects re2 library and usesit if a compatible version is detected.0.1 (2014-03-03)----------------Initial release.</longdescription>

Put ``attachments`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in your ``settings.py``   within your django project:   .. code-block:: python        INSTALLED_APPS = (            ...            'attachments',        )2. Add the attachments urlpattern to your ``urls.py``:   .. code-block:: python        url(r'^attachments/', include('attachments.urls', namespace='attachments')),3. Migrate your database:   .. code-block:: shell        ./manage.py migrate4. Grant the user some permissions:   * For **adding attachments** grant the user (or group) the permission     ``attachments.add_attachment``.   * For **deleting attachments** grant the user (or group) the permission     ``attachments.delete_attachment``. This allows the user to delete their     attachments only.   * For **deleting foreign attachments** (attachments by other users) grant     the user the permission ``attachments.delete_foreign_attachments``.5. Set ``DELETE_ATTACHMENTS_FROM_DISK`` to ``True`` if you want to remove   files from disk when Attachment objects are removed!6. Configure ``FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_SIZE`` (optional). This is the maximum size in   bytes before raising form validation errors. If not set there is no restriction   on file size.Mind that you serve files!==========================django-attachments stores the files in your site_media directory and does not modifythem. For example, if an user uploads a .html file your webserver will probably displayit in HTML. It's a good idea to serve such files as plain text. In a Apache2configuration this would look like:.. code-block:: apache    &lt;Location /site_media/attachments&gt;        AddType text/plain .html .htm .shtml .php .php5 .php4 .pl .cgi    &lt;/Location&gt;House-keeping=============django-attachments provides the ``delete_stale_attachments`` management command.It will remove all attachments for which the related objects don't exist anymore!Sys-admins could then:.. code-block:: shell    ./manage.py delete_stale_attachmentsYou may also want to execute this via cron.Tests=====Run the testsuite in your local environment using ``pipenv``:.. code-block:: shell    $ cd django-attachments/    $ pipenv install --dev    $ pipenv run pytest attachments/Or use tox to test against various Django and Python versions:.. code-block:: shell    $ tox -rYou can also invoke the test suite or other 'manage.py' commands by callingthe ``django-admin`` tool with the test app settings:.. code-block:: shell    $ cd django-attachments/    $ pipenv install --dev    $ pipenv run test    $ pipenv run django-admin.py runserverUsage:======In contrib.admin:-----------------django-attachments provides a inline object to add a list of attachments toany kind of model in your admin app.Simply add ``AttachmentInlines`` to the admin options of your model. Example:.. code-block:: python    from django.contrib import admin    from attachments.admin import AttachmentInlines    class MyEntryOptions(admin.ModelAdmin):        inlines = (AttachmentInlines,).. image:: http://cloud.github.com/downloads/bartTC/django-attachments/attachments_screenshot_admin.pngIn your frontend templates:---------------------------First of all, load the attachments_tags in every template you want to use it:.. code-block:: html+django    {% load attachments_tags %}django-attachments comes with some templatetags to add or delete attachmentsfor your model objects in your frontend.1. ``get_attachments_for [object]``: Fetches the attachments for the given   model instance. You can optionally define a variable name in which the attachment   list is stored in the template context (this is required in Django 1.8). If   you do not define a variable name, the result is printed instead.   .. code-block:: html+django        {% get_attachments_for entry as &quot;attachments_list&quot; %}2. ``attachments_count [object]``: Counts the attachments for the given   model instance and returns an int:   .. code-block:: html+django        {% attachments_count entry %}3. ``attachment_form``: Renders a upload form to add attachments for the given   model instance. Example:   .. code-block:: html+django        {% attachment_form [object] %}   It returns an empty string if the current user is not logged in.4. ``attachment_delete_link``: Renders a link to the delete view for the given   *attachment*. Example:   .. code-block:: html+django        {% for att in attachments_list %}            {{ att }} {% attachment_delete_link att %}        {% endfor %}   This tag automatically checks for permission. It returns only a html link if the   give n attachment's creator is the current logged in user or the user has the   ``delete_foreign_attachments`` permission.Quick Example:==============.. code-block:: html+django    {% load attachments_tags %}    {% get_attachments_for entry as my_entry_attachments %}    &lt;span&gt;Object has {% attachments_count entry %} attachments&lt;/span&gt;    {% if my_entry_attachments %}    &lt;ul&gt;    {% for attachment in my_entry_attachments %}        &lt;li&gt;            &lt;a href=&quot;{{ attachment.attachment_file.url }}&quot;&gt;{{ attachment.filename }}&lt;/a&gt;            {% attachment_delete_link attachment %}        &lt;/li&gt;    {% endfor %}    &lt;/ul&gt;    {% endif %}    {% attachment_form entry %}    {% if messages %}    &lt;ul class=&quot;messages&quot;&gt;    {% for message in messages %}        &lt;li{% if message.tags %} class=&quot;{{ message.tags }}&quot;{% endif %}&gt;            {{ message }}        &lt;/li&gt;    {% endfor %}    &lt;/ul&gt;    {% endif %}Changelog:==========v1.9.1 (2021-04-30)-------------------- Rebuild the previous version but don't ship a left-over migration filev1.9 (2021-04-29) -- removed from PyPI--------------------------------------- Configure PK explicitly to AutoField for Django 3.2+, see  https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/releases/3.2/#customizing-type-of-auto-created-primary-keys- Start testing with Django 3.2- Fix typo in README (Jesaja Everling)- Enable syntax highlighting in README (Basil S)v1.8 (2020-09-03)------------------ Alter ``object_id`` from ``TextField()`` to ``CharField(max_length=64)``,  and keep the db_index argument. This resolves the issues on MariaDB/MySQL.v1.7 (2020-08-31) - **broken on MariaDB/MySQL**------------------------------------------------ Add DB index to ``object_id``, ``created`` and ``modified`` fields.- Add ``delete_stale_attachments`` command to remove attachments for which  the corresponding object has been deleted.- Add ``Attachment.attach_to()`` method for moving attachments between  different objects.- Django 3.1 compatibility and tests.v1.6 (2020-08-17)------------------ Primary keys of related objects other than Integers (such as UUIDs)  are now supported.v1.5 (2019-12-08)------------------ Dropped support for Python 3.4.- Added suport for Python 3.8.- Django 3.0 compatibility and tests.- Django 2.2 compatibility and tests.v1.4.1 (2019-07-22)-------------------- The templatetags now allow an optional `next` parameter.v1.4 (2019-02-14)------------------ Dropped Support for Django &lt;=1.10.- Fixed 'next' URL argument redirect.v1.3.1 (2019-01-24):--------------------- Django 2.1 and Python 3.7 support.- General code cleanup.v1.3 (2018-01-09):------------------- Added a missing database migration.- New templatetag ``attachments_count``.- New setting ``DELETE_ATTACHMENTS_FROM_DISK`` to delete attachment files  if the attachment model is deleted.- New setting ``FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_SIZE`` to deny file uploads exceeding this  value.v1.2 (2017-12-15):------------------- Django 1.11 and 2.0 compatibility and tests.v1.1 (2017-03-18):------------------- Django 1.10 compatibility and tests.- Python 3.6 compatibility and tests.- Fixes problems where models have a foreign key named something other  than &quot;id&quot;.v1.0.1 (2016-06-12):--------------------- Added finnish translation.- Minor test suite improvements.v1.0 (2016-03-19):------------------- General code cleanup to keep compatibility with the latest Django  (currently 1.8 upwards) as well as Python3. Introduced full testsuite.- *Backwards incompatible*: The attachment views now use a urlpattern  ``namespace`` so you need to adjust the urlpattern::    url(r'^attachments/', include('attachments.urls', namespace='attachments')),- *Backwards incompatible*: The quotes around the ``as`` variable name   must be removed::     {% get_attachments_for entry as &quot;my_entry_attachments&quot; %}     becomes     {% get_attachments_for entry as my_entry_attachments %}- *Possibly backwards incompatible*: The old version had bugs around   permissions and were not enforcing it in all places. From now on the   related permissions ``add_attachment`` and ``delete_attachment`` must   been applied to all related users.v0.3.1 (2009-07-29):--------------------- Added a note to the README that you should secure your static files.v0.3 (2009-07-22):------------------- This version adds more granular control about user permissons. You need  to explicitly add permissions to users who should been able to upload,  delete or delete foreign attachments.  This might be *backwards incompatible* as you did not need to assign  add/delete permissions before!</longdescription>

For a certainprediction of a model, a counterfactual is an input element that is as similar as possible to the originalinput, but causes the largest possible deviation w.r.t. to the original model output prediction.They are sort of &quot;counter examples&quot; for the behavior of a model and can help to understand the decisionboundary of the model.The subject of this package are graph counterfactuals. They are generated by maximizing a customizabledistance function in regards to the prediction output over all immediate neighbors of the original graphw.r.t. to the allowed, domain-specific graph edit operations.📦 Installation===============.. code-block:: console    git clone https://github.com/the16thpythonist/vgd_counterfactualsThen in the main folder run a ``pip install``:.. code-block:: console    cd vgd_counterfactuals    python3 -m pip install .Afterwards, you can check the install by invoking the CLI:.. code-block:: console    python3 -m vgd_counterfactuals.cli --version    python3 -m vgd_counterfactuals.cli --help🚀 Quickstart=============The generation of counterfactual graphs is implemented via the ``CounterfactualGenerator`` class.The instantiation of one such object requires the following 4 main components:- ``processing``: A visual_graph_dataset &quot;Processing&quot; object. These implement the necessary functionality  to convert a domain-specific graph representation into the full graph structure for the machine learning  models. These are shipped with each specific visual graph dataset.- ``model``: The model to be explained. This model has to implement the visual_graph_dataset &quot;PredictGraph&quot;  interface to ensure that the model can be directly queried with the vgd GraphDict representation of  graph elements.- ``neighborhood_func``: A function which receives the domain-specific representation of a graph as an  input and is supposed to return a list of all the domain-specific representations of the  *immediate neighbors* of that graph. The implementation for this is highly specific to each application  domain.- ``distance_func``: A function which receives to arguments: The prediction of the original element and the  prediction of a neighbor and should return a single numeric value for the distance between the two  predictions. The generator will maximize this distance measure.After the generator object was instantiated, it can be used to create counterfactuals for any number ofinput elements using the ``generate`` method.The following example shows a quickstart mock example of how all of this can be used. For more informationhave a look at the example modules provided in the ``examples`` folder of the repository... code-block:: python    import tempfile    from visual_graph_datasets.processing.molecules import MoleculeProcessing    from vgd_counterfactuals.base import CounterfactualGenerator    from vgd_counterfactuals.testing import MockModel    from vgd_counterfactuals.generate.molecules import get_neighborhood    processing = MoleculeProcessing()    model = MockModel()    generator = CounterfactualGenerator(        processing=processing,        model=model,        neighborhood_func=get_neighborhood,        distance_func=lambda orig, mod: abs(orig - mod),    )    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as path:        # The &quot;generate&quot; function will create all the possible neighbors of the        # given &quot;original&quot; element, then query the model for to predict the        # output for each of them, and sort them by their distance to the original.        # The top k elements will be turned into a temporary visual graph dataset        # within the given folder &quot;path&quot;. That means in that folder two files will        # be created per element: A metadata JSON file and a visualization PNG file.        # Returns the dictionary for the loaded visual graph dataset.        index_data_map = generator.generate(            original='CCCCCC',            # Path to the folder into which to save the vgd element files            path=path,            # The number of counterfactuals to be returned.            # Elements will be sorted by their distance.            k_results=10,        )        # The keys of the resulting dict are the integer indices and the values        # are dicts themselves which describe the corresponding vgd elements.        # These dicts contain for example the absolute path to the PNG file,        # the full graph representation and additional metadata.        print(f'generated {len(index_data_map)} counterfactuals:')        for index, data in index_data_map.items():            print(f' * {data[&quot;metadata&quot;][&quot;name&quot;]} '                  f' - distance: {data[&quot;metadata&quot;][&quot;distance&quot;]:.2f}')🤝 Credits==========* `PyComex &lt;https://github.com/the16thpythonist/pycomex.git&gt;`_  is a micro framework which simplifies the setup, processing and management of computational  experiments. It is also used to auto-generate the command line interface that can be used to interact  with these experiments.* `VisualGraphDatasets &lt;https://github.com/awa59kst120df/visual_graph_datasets&gt;`_  is a library which deals with the VGD dataset format. In this format, graph datasets  for machine learning are represented by a folder, where each graph is represented by *two* files: A  metadata JSON file that contains the full graph representation and additional metadata and a PNG  visualization of the graph. The library aims to provide a framework for explainable graph machine learning  which is easier to use and produces more reproducable results.</longdescription>

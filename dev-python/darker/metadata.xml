It then- only applies reformatting in regions which have changed in the Git working tree  between the two revisions, and- only reports those linting messages which appeared after the modifications to the  source code files.The reformatters supported are:- Black_ for code reformatting- isort_ for sorting imports- flynt_ for turning old-style format strings to f-stringsSee `Using linters`_ below for the list of supported linters.To easily run Darker as a Pytest_ plugin, see pytest-darker_.To integrate Darker with your IDE or with pre-commit_,see the relevant sections below in this document... _Black: https://github.com/python/black.. _isort: https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort.. _flynt: https://github.com/ikamensh/flynt.. _Pytest: https://docs.pytest.org/.. _pytest-darker: https://pypi.org/project/pytest-darker/.. _#151: https://github.com/akaihola/darker/issues/151.. _community support channel: https://github.com/akaihola/darker/discussionsWhy?====You want to start unifying code style in your project using Black_.Maybe you also like to standardize on how to order your imports,or do static type checking or other static analysis for your code.However, instead of formatting the whole code base in one giant commit,you'd like to only change formatting when you're touching the code for other reasons.This can also be usefulwhen contributing to upstream codebases that are not under your complete control.Partial formatting is not supported by Black_ itself,for various good reasons, and so far there hasn't been a plan to implemented it either(`134`__, `142`__, `245`__, `370`__, `511`__, `830`__).However, in September 2021 Black developers started to hint towards adding this featureafter all (`1352`__). This might at least simplify Darker's algorithm substantially.__ https://github.com/psf/black/issues/134__ https://github.com/psf/black/issues/142__ https://github.com/psf/black/issues/245__ https://github.com/psf/black/issues/370__ https://github.com/psf/black/issues/511__ https://github.com/psf/black/issues/830__ https://github.com/psf/black/issues/1352But for the time being, this is where ``darker`` enters the stage.This tool is for those who want to do partial formatting right now.Note that this tool is meant for special situationswhen dealing with existing code bases.You should just use Black_ and isort_ as is when starting a project from scratch.You may also want to still consider whether reformatting the whole code base in onecommit would make sense in your particular case. You can ignore a reformatting commitin ``git blame`` using the `blame.ignoreRevsFile`_ config option or ``--ignore-rev`` onthe command line. For a deeper dive into this topic, see `Avoiding ruining git blame`_in Black documentation, or the article`Why does Black insist on reformatting my entire project?`_ from `Łukasz Langa`_(`@ambv`_, the creator of Black). Here's an excerpt:    &quot;When you make this single reformatting commit, everything that comes after is    **semantic changes** so your commit history is clean in the sense that it actually    shows what changed in terms of meaning, not style. There are tools like darker that    allow you to only reformat lines that were touched since the last commit. However,    by doing that you forever expose yourself to commits that are a mix of semantic    changes with stylistic changes, making it much harder to see what changed.&quot;.. _blame.ignoreRevsFile: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame/en#Documentation/git-blame.txt---ignore-revs-fileltfilegt.. _Avoiding ruining git blame: https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/introducing_black_to_your_project.html#avoiding-ruining-git-blame.. _Why does Black insist on reformatting my entire project?: https://lukasz.langa.pl/36380f86-6d28-4a55-962e-91c2c959db7a/.. _Łukasz Langa: https://lukasz.langa.pl/.. _@ambv: https://github.com/ambvHow?====To install or upgrade, use::  pip install --upgrade darker~=1.7.1Or, if you're using Conda_ for package management::  conda install -c conda-forge darker~=1.7.1 isort  conda update -c conda-forge darker..    **Note:** It is recommended to use the '``~=``' &quot;`compatible release`_&quot; version    specifier for Darker. See `Guarding against Black compatibility breakage`_ for more    information.The ``darker &lt;myfile.py&gt;`` or ``darker &lt;directory&gt;`` commandreads the original file(s),formats them using Black_,combines original and formatted regions based on edits,and writes back over the original file(s).Alternatively, you can invoke the module directly through the ``python`` executable,which may be preferable depending on your setup.Use ``python -m darker`` instead of ``darker`` in that case.By default, ``darker`` just runs Black_ to reformat the code.You can enable additional features with command line options:- ``-i`` / ``--isort``: Reorder imports using isort_. Note that isort_ must be  run in the same Python environment as the packages to process, as it imports  your modules to determine whether they are first or third party modules.- ``-f`` / ``--flynt``: Also convert string formatting to use f-strings using the  ``flynt`` package- ``-L &lt;linter&gt;`` / ``--lint &lt;linter&gt;``: Run a supported linter (see `Using linters`_)*New in version 1.1.0:* The ``-L`` / ``--lint`` option.*New in version 1.2.2:* Package available in conda-forge_.*New in version 1.7.0:* The ``-f`` / ``--flynt`` option.. _Conda: https://conda.io/.. _conda-forge: https://conda-forge.org/Example=======This example walks you through a minimal practical use case for Darker.First, create an empty Git repository:.. code-block:: shell   $ mkdir /tmp/test   $ cd /tmp/test   $ git init   Initialized empty Git repository in /tmp/test/.git/In the root of that directory, create the ill-formatted Python file ``our_file.py``:.. code-block:: python   if True: print('hi')   print()   if False: print('there')Commit that file:.. code-block:: shell   $ git add our_file.py   $ git commit -m &quot;Initial commit&quot;   [master (root-commit) a0c7c32] Initial commit    1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)    create mode 100644 our_file.pyNow modify the first line in that file:.. code-block:: python   if True: print('CHANGED TEXT')   print()   if False: print('there')You can ask Darker to show the diff for minimal reformattingwhich makes edited lines conform to Black rules:.. code-block:: diff   $ darker --diff our_file.py   --- our_file.py   +++ our_file.py   @@ -1,3 +1,4 @@   -if True: print('CHANGED TEXT')   +if True:   +    print(&quot;CHANGED TEXT&quot;)   print()   if False: print('there')Alternatively, Darker can output the full reformatted file(works only when a single Python file is provided on the command line):.. code-block:: shell   $ darker --stdout our_file.py.. code-block:: python   if True:       print(&quot;CHANGED TEXT&quot;)   print()   if False: print('there')If you omit the ``--diff`` and ``--stdout`` options,Darker replaces the files listed on the command linewith partially reformatted ones as shown above:.. code-block:: shell   $ darker our_file.pyNow the contents of ``our_file.py`` will have changed.Note that the original ``print()`` and ``if False: ...`` lines have not been reformattedsince they had not been edited!.. code-block:: python   if True:       print(&quot;CHANGED TEXT&quot;)   print()   if False: print('there')You can also ask Darker to reformat edited lines in all Python files in the repository:.. code-block:: shell   $ darker .Or, if you want to compare to another branch (or, in fact, any commit)instead of the last commit:.. code-block:: shell   $ darker --revision master .Customizing ``darker``, Black_, isort_, flynt_ and linter behavior==================================================================``darker`` invokes Black_ and isort_ internals directly instead of running theirbinaries, so it needs to read and pass configuration options to them explicitly.Project-specific default options for ``darker`` itself, Black_ and isort_ are read fromthe project's ``pyproject.toml`` file in the repository root. isort_ does also look fora few other places for configuration.Mypy_, Pylint_, Flake8_ and other compatible linters are invoked assubprocesses by ``darker``, so normal configuration mechanisms apply for each of thosetools. Linters can also be configured on the command line, for example::    darker -L &quot;mypy --strict&quot; .    darker --lint &quot;pylint --errors-only&quot; .  flynt_ (option ``-f`` / ``--flynt``) is also invoked as a subprocess, but passingcommand line options to it is currently not supported. Configuration files need to beused instead.Darker does honor exclusion options in Black configuration files when recursingdirectories, but the exclusions are only applied to Black reformatting. Isort andlinters are still run on excluded files. Also, individual files explicitly listed on thecommand line are still reformatted even if they match exclusion patterns.For more details, see:- `Black documentation about pyproject.toml`_- `isort documentation about config files`_- `public GitHub repositories which install and run Darker`_- `flynt documentation about configuration files`_The following `command line arguments`_ can also be used to modify the defaults:-r REV, --revision REV       Revisions to compare. The default is ``HEAD..:WORKTREE:`` which compares the       latest commit to the working tree. Tags, branch names, commit hashes, and other       expressions like ``HEAD~5`` work here. Also a range like ``main...HEAD`` or       ``main...`` can be used to compare the best common ancestor. With the magic value       ``:PRE-COMMIT:``, Darker works in pre-commit compatible mode. Darker expects the       revision range from the ``PRE_COMMIT_FROM_REF`` and ``PRE_COMMIT_TO_REF``       environment variables. If those are not found, Darker works against ``HEAD``.       Also see ``--stdin-filename=`` for the ``:STDIN:`` special value.--diff       Don't write the files back, just output a diff for each file on stdout. Highlight       syntax if on a terminal and the ``pygments`` package is available, or if enabled       by configuration.-d, --stdout       Force complete reformatted output to stdout, instead of in-place. Only valid if       there's just one file to reformat. Highlight syntax if on a terminal and the       ``pygments`` package is available, or if enabled by configuration.--stdin-filename PATH       The path to the file when passing it through stdin. Useful so Darker can find the       previous version from Git. Only valid with ``--revision=&lt;rev1&gt;..:STDIN:``       (``HEAD..:STDIN:`` being the default if ``--stdin-filename`` is enabled).--check       Don't write the files back, just return the status. Return code 0 means nothing       would change. Return code 1 means some files would be reformatted.-f, --flynt       Also convert string formatting to use f-strings using the ``flynt`` package-i, --isort       Also sort imports using the ``isort`` package-L CMD, --lint CMD       Also run a linter on changed files. ``CMD`` can be a name or path of the linter       binary, or a full quoted command line with the command and options. Linters read       their configuration as normally, and aren't affected by ``-c`` / ``--config``.       Linter output is syntax highlighted when the ``pygments`` package is available if       run on a terminal and or enabled by explicitly (see ``--color``).-c PATH, --config PATH       Ask ``black`` and ``isort`` to read configuration from ``PATH``. Note that other       tools like flynt, Mypy, Pylint and Flake8 won't use this configuration file.-v, --verbose       Show steps taken and summarize modifications-q, --quiet       Reduce amount of output--color       Enable syntax highlighting even for non-terminal output. Overrides the       environment variable PY_COLORS=0--no-color       Disable syntax highlighting even for terminal output. Overrides the environment       variable PY_COLORS=1-S, --skip-string-normalization       Don't normalize string quotes or prefixes--no-skip-string-normalization       Normalize string quotes or prefixes. This can be used to override       ``skip_string_normalization = true`` from a configuration file.--skip-magic-trailing-comma       Skip adding trailing commas to expressions that are split by comma where each       element is on its own line. This includes function signatures. This can be used       to override ``skip_magic_trailing_comma = true`` from a configuration file.-l LENGTH, --line-length LENGTH       How many characters per line to allow [default: 88]-t VERSION, --target-version VERSION       [py33|py34|py35|py36|py37|py38|py39|py310|py311] Python versions that should be       supported by Black's output. [default: per-file auto-detection]-W WORKERS, --workers WORKERS       How many parallel workers to allow, or ``0`` for one per core [default: 1]To change default values for these options for a given project,add a ``[tool.darker]`` or ``[tool.black]`` section to ``pyproject.toml`` in theproject's root directory, or to a different TOML file specified using the ``-c`` /``--config`` option. For example:.. code-block:: toml   [tool.darker]   src = [       &quot;src/mypackage&quot;,   ]   revision = &quot;master&quot;   diff = true   check = true   isort = true   flynt = true   lint = [       &quot;pylint&quot;,   ]   line-length = 80                  # Passed to isort and Black, override their config   log_level = &quot;INFO&quot;   [tool.black]   line-length = 88                  # Overridden by [tool.darker] above   skip-magic-trailing-comma = false   skip-string-normalization = false   target-version = ['py311']   exclude = &quot;test_*\.py&quot;   extend_exclude = &quot;/generated/&quot;   force_exclude = &quot;.*\.pyi&quot;   [tool.isort]   profile = &quot;black&quot;   known_third_party = [&quot;pytest&quot;]   line_length = 88                  # Overridden by [tool.darker] aboveWhile isort_ reads all of its options from the configuration file, Black_ only honorsthe ones listed above when called by ``darker``. Other tools are invoked assubprocesses and use their configuration mechanisms unmodified.Be careful to not use options which generate output which is unexpected forother tools. For example, VSCode only expects the reformat diff, so``lint = [ ... ]`` can't be used with it.*New in version 1.0.0:*- The ``-c``, ``-S`` and ``-l`` command line options.- isort_ is configured with ``-c`` and ``-l``, too.*New in version 1.1.0:* The command line options- ``-r`` / ``--revision``- ``--diff``- ``--check``- ``--no-skip-string-normalization``- ``-L`` / ``--lint``*New in version 1.2.0:* Support for- commit ranges in ``-r`` / ``--revision``.- a ``[tool.darker]`` section in ``pyproject.toml``.*New in version 1.2.2:* Support for ``-r :PRE-COMMIT:`` / ``--revision=:PRE_COMMIT:``*New in version 1.3.0:* The ``--skip-magic-trailing-comma`` and ``-d`` / ``--stdout``command line options*New in version 1.5.0:* The ``-W`` / ``--workers``, ``--color`` and ``--no-color``command line options*New in version 1.7.0:* The ``-t`` / ``--target-version`` command line option*New in version 1.7.0:* The ``-f`` / ``--flynt`` command line option.. _Black documentation about pyproject.toml: https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/the_basics.html#configuration-via-a-file.. _isort documentation about config files: https://timothycrosley.github.io/isort/docs/configuration/config_files/.. _public GitHub repositories which install and run Darker: https://github.com/search?q=%2Fpip+install+.*darker%2F+path%3A%2F%5E.github%5C%2Fworkflows%5C%2F.*%2F&amp;type=code.. _flynt documentation about configuration files: https://github.com/ikamensh/flynt#configuration-files.. _command line arguments: https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/the_basics.html#command-line-optionsEditor integration==================Many editors have plugins or recipes for integrating Black_.You may be able to adapt them to be used with ``darker``.See `editor integration`__ in the Black_ documentation.__ https://github.com/psf/black/#editor-integrationPyCharm/IntelliJ IDEA---------------------1.

Add these configuration options to VS code, ``Cmd-Shift-P``, ``Open Settings (JSON)``::    &quot;python.formatting.provider&quot;: &quot;black&quot;,    &quot;python.formatting.blackPath&quot;: &quot;&lt;install_location_from_step_2&gt;&quot;,    &quot;python.formatting.blackArgs&quot;: [],VSCode will always add ``--diff --quiet`` as arguments to Darker,but you can also pass additional arguments in the ``blackArgs`` option(e.g. ``[&quot;--isort&quot;, &quot;--revision=master...&quot;]``).Be sure to *not* enable any linters here or in ``pyproject.toml``since VSCode won't be able to understand output from them.Note that VSCode first copies the file to reformat into a temporary``&lt;filename&gt;.py.&lt;hash&gt;.tmp`` file, then calls Black (or Darker in this case) on thatfile, and brings the changes in the modified files back into the editor.Darker is aware of this behavior, and will correctly compare ``.py.&lt;hash&gt;.tmp`` filesto corresponding ``.py`` files from earlier repository revisions.Vim---Unlike Black_ and many other formatters, ``darker`` needs access to the Git history.Therefore it does not work properly with classical auto reformat plugins.You can though ask vim to run ``darker`` on file save with the following in your``.vimrc``:.. code-block:: vim   set autoread   autocmd BufWritePost *.py silent :!darker %- ``BufWritePost`` to run ``darker`` *once the file has been saved*,- ``silent`` to not ask for confirmation each time,- ``:!`` to run an external command,- ``%`` for current file name.Vim should automatically reload the file.Emacs-----You can integrate with Emacs using Steve Purcell's `emacs-reformatter`__ library.Using `use-package`__:.. code-block:: emacs-lisp    (use-package reformatter      :hook ((python-mode . darker-reformat-on-save-mode))      :config      (reformatter-define darker-reformat        :program &quot;darker&quot;        :stdin nil        :stdout nil        :args (list &quot;-q&quot; input-file))This will automatically reformat the buffer on save.You have multiple functions available to launch it manually:- darker-reformat- darker-reformat-region- darker-reformat-buffer__ https://github.com/purcell/emacs-reformatter__ https://github.com/jwiegley/use-packageUsing as a pre-commit hook==========================*New in version 1.2.1*To use Darker locally as a Git pre-commit hook for a Python project,do the following:1. Install pre-commit_ in your environment   (see `pre-commit Installation`_ for details).2. Create a base pre-commit configuration::       pre-commit sample-config &gt;.pre-commit-config.yaml3. Append to the created ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` the following lines:   .. code-block:: yaml      - repo: https://github.com/akaihola/darker        rev: 1.7.1        hooks:          - id: darker4. install the Git hook scripts and update to the newest version::       pre-commit install       pre-commit autoupdateWhen auto-updating, care is being taken to protect you from possible incompatibilitiesintroduced by Black updates. See `Guarding against Black compatibility breakage`_ formore information.If you'd prefer to not update but keep a stable pre-commit setup, you can pin Black andother reformatter/linter tools you use to known compatible versions, for example:.. code-block:: yaml   - repo: https://github.com/akaihola/darker     rev: 1.7.1     hooks:       - id: darker         args:           - --isort           - --lint mypy           - --lint flake8           - --lint pylint         additional_dependencies:           - black==22.12.0           - isort==5.11.4           - mypy==0.990           - flake8==5.0.4           - pylint==2.15.5.. _pre-commit: https://pre-commit.com/.. _pre-commit Installation: https://pre-commit.com/#installationUsing arguments---------------You can provide arguments, such as enabling isort, by specifying ``args``.Note the inclusion of the isort Python package under ``additional_dependencies``:.. code-block:: yaml   - repo: https://github.com/akaihola/darker     rev: 1.7.1     hooks:       - id: darker         args: [--isort]         additional_dependencies:           - isort~=5.9GitHub Actions integration==========================You can use Darker within a GitHub Actions workflowwithout setting your own Python environment.Great for enforcing that modifications and additions to your codematch the Black_ code style.Compatibility-------------This action is known to support all GitHub-hosted runner OSes. In addition, onlypublished versions of Darker are supported (i.e. whatever is available on PyPI).You can `search workflows in public GitHub repositories`_ to see how Darker is beingused... _search workflows in public GitHub repositories: https://github.com/search?q=%22uses%3A+akaihola%2Fdarker%22+path%3A%2F%5E.github%5C%2Fworkflows%5C%2F.*%2F&amp;type=codeUsage-----Create a file named ``.github/workflows/darker.yml`` inside your repository with:.. code-block:: yaml   name: Lint   on: [push, pull_request]   jobs:     lint:       runs-on: ubuntu-latest       steps:         - uses: actions/checkout@v3           with:             fetch-depth: 0          - uses: actions/setup-python@v4         - uses: akaihola/darker@1.7.1           with:             options: &quot;--check --diff --isort --color&quot;             src: &quot;./src&quot;             version: &quot;~=1.7.1&quot;             lint: &quot;flake8,pylint==2.13.1&quot;There needs to be a working Python environment, set up using ``actions/setup-python``in the above example. Darker will be installed in an isolated virtualenv to preventconflicts with other workflows.``&quot;uses:&quot;`` specifies which Darker release to get the GitHub Action definition from.We recommend to pin this to a specific release.``&quot;version:&quot;`` specifies which version of Darker to run in the GitHub Action.It defaults to the same version as in ``&quot;uses:&quot;``,but you can force it to use a different version as well.Darker versions available from PyPI are supported, as well as commit SHAs or branchnames, prefixed with an ``@`` symbol (e.g. ``version: &quot;@master&quot;``).The ``revision: &quot;master...&quot;`` (or ``&quot;main...&quot;``) option instructs Darkerto compare the current branch to the branching point from main branchwhen determining which source code lines have been changed.If omitted, the Darker GitHub Action will determine the commit range automatically.``&quot;src:&quot;`` defines the root directory to run Darker for.This is typically the source tree, but you can use ``&quot;.&quot;`` (the default)to also reformat Python files like ``&quot;setup.py&quot;`` in the root of the whole repository.You can also configure other arguments passed to Darker via ``&quot;options:&quot;``.It defaults to ``&quot;--check --diff --color&quot;``.You can e.g. add ``&quot;--isort&quot;`` to sort imports, or ``&quot;--verbose&quot;`` for debug logging.To run linters through Darker, you can provide a comma separated list of linters usingthe ``lint:`` option. Only ``flake8``, ``pylint`` and ``mypy`` are supported. Otherlinters may or may not work with Darker, depending on their message output format.Versions can be constrained using ``pip`` syntax, e.g. ``&quot;flake8&gt;=3.9.2&quot;``.*New in version 1.1.0:*GitHub Actions integration. Modeled after how Black_ does it,thanks to Black authors for the example!*New in version 1.4.1:*The ``revision:`` option, with smart default value if omitted.*New in version 1.5.0:*The ``lint:`` option... _Using linters:Using linters=============One way to use Darker is to filter linter output to only those linter messageswhich appeared after the modifications to source code files,as well as old messages which concern modified lines.Darker supports any linter with output in one of the following formats::    &lt;file&gt;:&lt;linenum&gt;: &lt;description&gt;    &lt;file&gt;:&lt;linenum&gt;:&lt;col&gt;: &lt;description&gt;Most notably, the following linters/checkers have been verified to work with Darker:- Mypy_ for static type checking- Pylint_ for generic static checking of code- Flake8_ for style guide enforcement- `cov_to_lint.py`_ for test coverage*New in version 1.1.0:* Support for Mypy_, Pylint_, Flake8_ and compatible linters.*New in version 1.2.0:* Support for test coverage output using `cov_to_lint.py`_.To run a linter, use the ``--lint`` / ``-L`` command line option with the lintercommand or a full command line to pass to a linter. Some examples:- ``-L flake8``: enforce the Python style guide using Flake8_- ``-L &quot;mypy --strict&quot;``: do static type checking using Mypy_- ``--lint=&quot;pylint --ignore='setup.py'&quot;&quot;``: analyze code using Pylint_- ``-L cov_to_lint.py``: read ``.coverage`` and list non-covered modified lines**Note:** Full command lines aren't fully tested on Windows. See issue `#456`_ for apossible bug.Darker also groups linter output into blocks of consecutive linesseparated by blank lines.Here's an example of `cov_to_lint.py`_ output::    $ darker --revision 0.1.0.. --check --lint cov_to_lint.py src    src/darker/__main__.py:94:  no coverage:             logger.debug(&quot;No changes in %s after isort&quot;, src)    src/darker/__main__.py:95:  no coverage:             break    src/darker/__main__.py:125: no coverage:         except NotEquivalentError:    src/darker/__main__.py:130: no coverage:             if context_lines == max_context_lines:    src/darker/__main__.py:131: no coverage:                 raise    src/darker/__main__.py:132: no coverage:             logger.debug(+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+|                               ⚠ NOTE ⚠                                |+=======================================================================+| Don't enable linting on the command line or in the configuration when || running Darker as a reformatter in VSCode.

You can force disable syntax highlighting on terminal output using- the ``color = false`` option in ``pyproject.toml``,- the ``PY_COLORS=0`` environment variable, and- the ``--no-color`` command line option.In the above lists, latter configuration methods override earlier ones, so the commandline options always take highest precedence... _Pygments: https://pypi.org/project/Pygments/Guarding against Black compatibility breakage=============================================Darker accesses some Black internals which don't belong to its public API. Darker isthus subject to becoming incompatible with future versions of Black.To protect users against such breakage, we test Darker daily against the `Black mainbranch`_ and strive to proactively fix any potential incompatibilities through thisprocess. If a commit to Black ``main`` branch introduces an incompatibility withDarker, we will release a first patch version for Darker that prevents upgrading Blackand a second patch version that fixes the incompatibility. A hypothetical example:1. Darker 9.0.0; Black 35.12.0   -&gt; OK2. Darker 9.0.0; Black ``main`` (after 35.12.0)   -&gt; ERROR on CI test-future_ workflow3. Darker 9.0.1 released, with constraint ``Black&lt;=35.12.0``   -&gt; OK4. Black 36.1.0 released, but Darker 9.0.1 prevents upgrade; Black 35.12.0   -&gt; OK5. Darker 9.0.2 released with a compatibility fix, constraint removed; Black 36.1.0   -&gt; OKIf a Black release introduces an incompatibility before the second Darker patch versionthat fixes it, the first Darker patch version will downgrade Black to the latestcompatible version:1. Darker 9.0.0; Black 35.12.0   -&gt; OK2. Darker 9.0.0; Black 36.1.0   -&gt; ERROR3. Darker 9.0.1, constraint ``Black&lt;=35.12.0``; downgrades to Black 35.12.0   -&gt; OK4. Darker 9.0.2 released with a compatibility fix, constraint removed; Black 36.1.0   -&gt; OKTo be completely safe, you can pin both Darker and Black to known good versions, butthis may prevent you from receiving improvements in Black. It is recommended to use the '``~=``' &quot;`compatible release`_&quot; version specifier forDarker to ensure you have the latest version before the next major release that maycause compatibility issues. See issue `#382`_ and PR `#430`_ for more information... _compatible release: https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#compatible-release.. _Black main branch: https://github.com/psf/black/commits/main.. _test-future: https://github.com/akaihola/darker/blob/master/.github/workflows/test-future.yml.. _#382: https://github.com/akaihola/darker/issues/382.. _#430: https://github.com/akaihola/darker/issues/430How does it work?=================Darker takes a ``git diff`` of your Python files,records which lines of current files have been edited or added since the last commit.It then runs Black_ and notes which chunks of lines were reformatted.Finally, only those reformatted chunks on which edited lines fall (even partially)are applied to the edited file.Also, in case the ``--isort`` option was specified,isort_ is run on each edited file before applying Black_.Similarly, each linter requested using the `--lint &lt;command&gt;` option is run,and only those linting messages are displayed which appeared after the modifications tothe source code files,or which were there already before but now fall on modified lines.License=======BSD.

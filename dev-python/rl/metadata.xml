	<longdescription>==rl==--------------------------------------------Alternative Python bindings for GNU Readline--------------------------------------------Overview============The `GNU Readline Library`_ is the canonical implementation of command lineediting, tab completion, and history for console-based applications.It is developed as part of Bash and available on virtually any platform.While Python ships with readline bindings in its standard library, theyonly implement a subset of readline's features, just enough to performidentifier completion at the Python interpreter prompt.The **rl** package aims to provide full implementations of GNU Readline's`Custom Completer`_ and `History`_ interfaces.It also contains high-level APIs to better organize the namespace andshield applications from low-level verbosity... _`GNU Readline Library`: https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html.. _`Custom Completer`: https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/readline.html#Custom-Completers.. _`History`: https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/history.html#History-FunctionsPackage Contents================rl exports these components:completer    Interface to the readline completer. Used to configure the completion    aspects of readline.completion    Interface to the active readline completion. Used to interact    with readline when a completion is in progress.history    Interface to the readline history. Used to read and write history files    and to manipulate history entries.readline    The readline bindings module. Contains everything known from the standard    library plus extensions specific to the rl package.  The *completer*,    *completion*, and *history* interfaces make use of this module, and you    should rarely need to interact with it directly.generator    A decorator turning any callable into a *completion entry function* that    can be handed to readline.print_exc    A decorator printing exceptions to stderr. Useful when writing Python    completions and hooks, as exceptions occurring there are usually    swallowed by the in-between C code.Documentation=============For further details please refer to the `API Documentation`_... _`API Documentation`: https://rl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Development===========rl development is hosted on GitHub_ where it also has an `issue tracker`_... _GitHub: https://github.com/stefanholek/rl.. _`issue tracker`: https://github.com/stefanholek/rl/issuesInstallation============rl requires Python 2.7 or higher. The installer builds GNU Readline 8.2and a Python extension module.On Mac OS X make sure you have Xcode Tools installed. Open a Terminalwindow and type::    gcc --versionYou either see some output (good) or an installer window pops up. Clickthe &quot;Install&quot; button to install the command line developer tools.A more detailed tutorial is available from the `Mac Install Guide`_... _`Mac Install Guide`: https://mac.install.guide/commandlinetools/index.htmlOn Linux and BSD systems you probably already have a C compiler, but you mayneed to verify the development environment is complete.For example, Ubuntu lacks the Python headers by default and Fedora ismissing some compiler configuration. Lastly, readline needs a termcap libraryto link to.Ubuntu/Debian::    sudo apt install build-essential    sudo apt install python3-dev    sudo apt install libncurses-devRedhat/Fedora::    sudo dnf install gcc    sudo dnf install redhat-rpm-config    sudo dnf install ncurses-develThen type::    pip install rlRelated=======`kmd.Kmd`_ is an rl-enabled version of `cmd.Cmd`_... _`kmd.Kmd`: https://github.com/stefanholek/kmd.. _`cmd.Cmd`: https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.htmlChangelog=========3.1 - 2022-10-31----------------- Include GNU Readline 8.2.  [stefan]- Improve documentation and example code. Promote using ``generator`` as a  decorator.  [stefan]- Document how ``directory_completion_hook`` interacts with new hooks added  in version 3.0.  [stefan]- Implement Python 3.6 ``readline.set_auto_history`` and the corresponding  ``history.auto``.  [stefan]- Fall back to ncurses if termcap auto-detection fails. This at least produces  a linker error instead of silently borking the extension.  [stefan]- Replace deprecated ``python setup.py test`` in tox.ini.  [stefan]- Remove deprecated ``test_suite`` from setup.py.  [stefan]- Remove setuptools from ``install_requires``.  [stefan]- Add a pyproject.toml file.  [stefan]- Include tests in sdist but not in wheel.  [stefan]3.0 - 2019-03-20----------------- rl is now GPLv3 because it statically links to GNU Readline.  [stefan]- Include GNU Readline 8.0.  [stefan]- Support Python 3.6 os.PathLike objects for filenames.  [stefan]- Handle new GIL checks in Python 3.6. See `PYTHONMALLOC`_.  [stefan]- Add ``history.max_file`` and ``history.append_file``.  [stefan]- Add ``directory_rewrite_hook``, ``filename_rewrite_hook``, and  ``filename_stat_hook``.  [stefan]- Catch up with bug fixes applied to the standard library readline module.  [stefan]- Stop using 2to3.  [stefan]- Remove ``reset`` APIs from the documentation. They override  ``~/.inputrc`` and should only be used in tests.

See Python `issue 12186`_.  [stefan]- Add a default ``display_matches_hook`` that behaves exactly like readline  behaves in Bash.  [stefan]- Add ``reset`` functions to completer, completion, and history.  [stefan].. _`issue 12186`: https://bugs.python.org/issue121861.14 - 2011-05-05------------------ Add xfree.c to sources when building GNU Readline 6.2.  [stefan]- Allow history indexes of type long.

[stefan]1.6 - 2010-03-07----------------- The history size can now be limited (&quot;stifled&quot;) by setting  ``history.max_entries``. This supersedes ``history.length`` which has been  removed.  [stefan]- Close a memory leak in ``get_current_history_length``. Also see Python  `issue 8065`_.  [stefan].. _`issue 8065`: https://bugs.python.org/issue80651.5.4 - 2010-03-01------------------- Avoid segfaults during codec lookup by calling ``PyGILState_Ensure`` in all  the right places.

[stefan]1.1 - 2009-11-16----------------- Remove all occurrences of old-style function typedefs to silence  compiler warnings.  [stefan]- Make the ``display_matches_hook`` work in Python 2.5. Fixes rl `issue/1`_.  [stefan]- No longer auto-refresh the prompt at the end of ``display_match_list``.  Applications should call ``redisplay(force=True)`` to restore the prompt.

Three cheers for Xcode's  ``leaks`` tool.  [stefan]1.0a7 - 2009-11-05------------------- Rename ``_readline`` module to ``readline`` since it's not private.  [stefan]- Remove ``dump`` and ``read_key`` APIs from public interfaces.  [stefan]1.0a6 - 2009-10-30------------------- Unclutter the ``completer`` interface by removing settings that can  just as well be made with ``parse_and_bind``.  [stefan]- Fix a memory leak in ``username_completion_function`` and  ``filename_completion_function``.  [stefan]- Add a custom epydoc stylesheet to make its reST rendering more pleasant.  [stefan]1.0a5 - 2009-10-29------------------- Make all ``completion`` properties writable. While not useful in  production, this allows us to write better tests.  [stefan]- Improve API documentation and add a call graph for the completion  process. This goes a long way in explaining how readline completion  works.  [stefan]1.0a4 - 2009-10-27------------------- Implement the ``generator`` factory using an iterator instead of a list.  [stefan]- Remove ``find_completion_word`` so people don't get ideas.  [stefan]- Don't list distribute as dependency, setuptools will do the  right thing.  [stefan]1.0a3 - 2009-10-22------------------- Add ``__slots__`` to interface objects to make them immutable.  [stefan]- Support Python 2.5, 2.6, and 3.1 (thanks to distribute).  [stefan]- Approach something like test coverage.  [stefan]1.0a2 - 2009-10-08------------------- Make the ``generator`` factory work for all types of callables.  [stefan]- Improve examples.

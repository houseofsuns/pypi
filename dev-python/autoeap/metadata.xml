The details of autoEAP are published in [Bódi et al.,2022,PASP,134,14503](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PASP..134a4503B) and [Plachy et al.,2019,ApJS,244,32](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJS..244...32P/abstract).A short summary of automatization is published [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200908786P/abstract).# Installation and dependenciesTo install the package, use:```bashpip install autoeap```## Example usageTo create your own photomery, you'll need a Target Pixel File, such as [this one.](https://github.com/konkolyseismolab/autoeap/blob/master/examples/ktwo212466080-c17_lpd-targ.fits)Then, after starting Python, you can do:```pythonyourtpf = '/path/to/your/tpf/ktwo212466080-c17_lpd-targ.fits'import autoeaptime, flux, flux_err = autoeap.createlightcurve(yourtpf)```Or if you want to let autoEAP download the TPF from MAST database, you can just provide a target name and _optionally_ a campaign number:```pythonimport autoeaptargetID = 'EPIC 212466080'campaign = 17time, flux, flux_err = autoeap.createlightcurve(targetID,campaign=campaign)```**With this last line, you can create autoEAP photometry for any K2 variable star.**Plotting our results gives:```pythonimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltplt.figure(figsize=(10,5))plt.plot(time,flux,'.')plt.xlabel('KBJD')plt.ylabel('Flux')plt.show()```![example scatter plot2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/konkolyseismolab/autoeap/master/docs/ktwo212466080-c17_raw.jpg)The details of the workflow is described in [docs](https://github.com/konkolyseismolab/autoeap/tree/master/docs).You can find Google Colab friendly tutorials [in the examples](https://github.com/konkolyseismolab/autoeap/tree/master/examples).### Apply K2 Systematics Correction (K2SC)If you want to apply K2SC correction for your freshly made raw-photometry, first you should install [K2SC](https://github.com/OxES/k2sc). AutoEAP is based on that package, so if you find K2SC useful, please cite [Aigrain et al.,2016,MNRAS,459,2408](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.459.2408A/abstract).Installation with ``george``:```bashpip install george k2sc```And then without much hassle, you can apply the correction in python:```pythonimport autoeaptargetID = 'EPIC 212466080'campaign = 17time, flux, flux_err = autoeap.createlightcurve(targetID,campaign=campaign,apply_K2SC=True)```The result is quite delightful:```pythonimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltplt.figure(figsize=(10,5))plt.plot(time,flux,'.')plt.xlabel('KBJD')plt.ylabel('Flux')plt.show()```![k2sc result](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/konkolyseismolab/autoeap/master/docs/ktwo212466080-c17_k2sc.jpg)### Apply trend correctionWe have also built-in a method to remove trends using low-order splines. To correct the raw light curve, do:```pythonimport autoeaptime, flux, flux_err = autoeap.createlightcurve(yourtpf,detrend=True)```Or do this to remove a spline from the K2SC light curve:```pythonimport autoeaptime, flux, flux_err = autoeap.createlightcurve(yourtpf,apply_K2SC=True,detrend=True)```## Available options - `apply_K2SC` If `True`, after the raw photomery, K2SC will be applied to remove systematics from the extracted light curve. - `detrend` If `True`, after the raw photomery, a low-order spline will be fitted and removed from the extracted light curve. If ``apply_K2SC`` is also `True`, then this step will be done after the K2SC. - `save_lc` If `True`, the intermediate and the final light curves will be save as a file. - `save_aperture` If `True` the final aperture will be saved to a FITS file. - `campaign` If local TPF file is not found, it will be downloaded from MAST, but ``campaign`` number should be defined as well, if the target has been observed in more than one campaign. Otherwise that campaign will be used in which the target were first observed. - `show_plots` If `True`, all the plots that visualize each step of photometry will be displayed. - `save_plots` If `True`, all the plots that visualize each step of photometry will be saved to a subdirectory. - `polyorder` The order of the detrending polynomial. Applies only if ``detrend`` is `True`. Default is `'auto'`. - `sigma_detrend` The number of standard deviations to use for sigma clipping limit before spline correction. Applies only if ``detrend`` is `True`. Default is `10`. - `max_missing_pos_corr` Maximum number of missing position correction (POS_CORR) values.     If too many POS_CORR is missing, then less reliable photometrically     estimated centroids will be used for K2SC. Missing POS_CORR values     reduce the number of light curve points! Default is `10`. - `TH` Threshold to segment each target in each TPF candence. Only used if targets cannot be separated normally. Default is `8`. Do not change this value unless you are aware of what you are doing! - `ROI_lower` The aperture frequency grid range of interest threshold given in absolute number of selections above which pixels are considered to define the apertures.  Do not change this value unless you are aware of what you are doing! Default is `100`. - `ROI_upper` The aperture frequency grid range of interest threshold given in relative number of selections w.r.t. the number of all cadences below which pixels are considered to define the apertures. Do not change this value unless you are aware of what you are doing! Default is `0.85`. - `**kwargs` Dictionary of arguments to be passed to ``k2sc.detrend``. [See options here](https://github.com/OxES/k2sc/blob/master/src/standalone.py#L41).## Command-line toolsAfter installation, ``autoEAP`` will be available from the command line: - ``autoEAP &lt;EPIC number or TPF path&gt; [options]`` Listed below are the usage instructions:```bash$ autoeap --helpusage: autoeap [-h] [--campaign &lt;campaign-number&gt;] [--applyK2SC]               [--removespline] [--polyorder &lt;detrending-polynomial-order&gt;]               [--sigmadetrend &lt;detrending-sigma-limit&gt;] [--saveplots]               [--maxmissingposcorr &lt;max-missing-pos-corr&gt;]               [--TH &lt;threshold-value&gt;] [--ROIlower &lt;lower-ROI-value&gt;]               [--ROIupper &lt;upper-ROI-value&gt;]               &lt;path-to-targettpf-or-EPIC-number&gt;Perform autoEAP photometry on K2 variable stars.positional arguments:  &lt;path-to-targettpf-or-EPIC-number&gt;                        The location of the local TPF file or an EPIC number to be downloaded from MAST.

See: [K2 approved targets &amp; programs.](https://keplergo.github.io/KeplerScienceWebsite/k2-approved-programs.html)The data we have already created have been uploaded to our [webpage](https://konkoly.hu/KIK/data_en.html).## Standalone PDM-based detrenderThe PDM-based polynomial fitting and detrending can be used as a standalone module to be applied to e.g. raw `autoEAP` light curves or any other data sets given a time series with times, fluxes and flux errors. The `detrend_wrt_PDM` method returns the corrected flux values.```pythonfrom autoeap.detrender import detrend_wrt_PDMcorrflux = detrend_wrt_PDM(time,               # Time values                           flux,               # Flux values                           flux_err,           # Flux errors                           polyorder='auto',   # Polynomial order or 'auto'                           sigma=10,           # Sigma value for sigma clipping before PDM calculation                           show_plots=True,    # Show the detrending process                           save_plots=False,   # Save the detrending process plot                           filename=None)      # to this file as PNG.```## ContributingFeel free to open PR / Issue, or contact us [here](bodi.attila@csfk.org) or [here](ps738@cam.ac.uk).## CitingIf you use data provided by this pipeline please cite [Bódi et al.,2022,PASP,134,14503](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PASP..134a4503B) and [Plachy et al.,2019,ApJS,244,32](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJS..244...32P/abstract).

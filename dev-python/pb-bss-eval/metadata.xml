All the credits goes to the original authors (see [here](https://github.com/fgnt/pb_bss)).  As can be seen in the [Manifest.in](./MANIFEST.in), only the evaluation sub-package can be installed and is released on PyPI.To install it, just run :```pip install numpy Cython  # required for pesq installpip install pb_bss_eval```This repository covers EM algorithms to separate speech sources in multi-channel recordings.  In particular, the repository contains methods to integrate Deep Clustering (a neural network-based source separation algorithm) with a probabilistic spatial mixture model as proposed in the Interspeech paper &quot;Tight integration of spatial and spectral features for BSS with Deep Clustering embeddings&quot; presented at Interspeech 2017 in Stockholm.```BibTex@InProceedings{Drude2017DeepClusteringIntegration,  Title                    = {Tight integration of spatial and spectral features for {BSS} with Deep Clustering embeddings},  Author                   = {Drude, Lukas and and Haeb-Umbach, Reinhold},  Booktitle                = {INTERSPEECH 2017, Stockholm, Sweden},  Year                     = {2017},  Month                    = {Aug}}```# InstallationInstall it directly from source```bashgit clone https://github.com/fgnt/pb_bss.gitcd pb_bsspip install --editable .```We expect that `numpy`, `scipy` and `cython` are installed (e.g. `conda install numpy scipy cython` or `pip install numpy scipy cython`).The default option is to install only the necessary dependencies.When you want to run the tests or execute the notebooks, use the one of the following commands for the installation:```bashpip install --editable .[all]  # Without a whitespace between `.` and `[all]`pip install git+https://github.com/fgnt/pb_bss.git#egg=pb_bss[all]```</longdescription>

	<longdescription>## DRF Nested Utils[![pypi package](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/drf-nested.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/drf-nested/)This package provides a set of utils to help developers implement nested data handling for Django Rest Framework.This package adds support for:* Direct relation handling (`ForeignKey`)* Reverse relation handling (i.e. allows working with models that have current as `ForeignKey`)* Direct and reverse `ManyToMany`, with special flow for the m2m relationships with custom `through` models* `GenericRelation` with special mixinsIt also provides mixins for handling `Unique` and `UniqueTogether` validators.## Mixins### Nested Serializer Mixins#### `BaseNestedMixin`Base mixin that contains the methods for retrieval of all related fields of the serializer model. It also provides all the `update_or_create` methods for each type of fields (`direct relation`, `reverse relation`, `many-to-many relation` and `generic relation`).#### `CreateNestedMixin`Mixin that allows creation of the nested models on serializer `create` call. You can provide a list of fields that should be forbidden on create, the list of fields should be placed into the `forbidden_on_create` field on serializer `Meta` class.Mixin uses `BaseNestedMixin` properties and `update_and_create` methods to create nested fields.#### `UpdateNestedMixin`Mixin that allows modification of the nested models on serializer `update` call.Mixin uses `BaseNestedMixin` properties and `update_and_create` methods to update nested fields.### Validator Mixins#### `UniqueFieldMixin`Mixin that allows usage of the `unique` fields with nested mixins. This mixin moves the validation process from `is_valid` to `create/update` call. This is done because the fields that should be used in the `unique` validation may not be set on the initial `is_valid` call and are set just before the nested `create/update` call. #### `UniqueTogetherMixin`Mixin that allows usage of the `unique_together` fields with nested mixins. This mixin moves the validation process from `is_valid` to `create/update` call. This is done because the fields that should be used in the `unique_together` validation may not be set on the initial `is_valid` call and are set just before the nested `create/update` call.### Helper Mixins#### `NestableMixin`Mixin that allows to specify the name of the nested field by setting `write_source` if the initial `source` of the field is different from the field name or the initial `source` is not writable (a property, for example).#### `ThroughMixin`Mixin that allows to specify if `through` model should be connected to current model after the `through` model `create/update` call.#### `GenericRelationMixin`Mixin that should be used on serializers that represent connected by `GenericRelation` models.## ExamplesYou can see an example project in `examples/` directory.## Notes&gt; If you are using a Many-to-Many field with `source` property or you have a `through` model on your serializer, you should add a `NestableMixin` to the target serializer and add a `write_source` field when you initialize that serializer.&gt; In case of the `source` property you should add an actual model field that would allow you to properly connect your model with related ones. &gt; In case of the `through` model you should have it set to the `related_name` of the connected `through` model&gt; You can also use `ThroughMixin` and set `connect_to_model` to False if you want to have the ability to keep the `through` model connection in case the `through` model ForeignKey should be different from the current model.</longdescription>

In any case your jobis all about working with data.As a data scientist you don't spend most of your time producing coolvisualizations or finding great insights. The majority of your time is spentwrangling with URLs, figuring out how to stitch together two tables, hopingthat the dates, won't break, without you knowing, or trying to generate thenext 124,538 keywords for an upcoming campaign, by the end of the week!``advertools`` is a Python package that can hopefully make that part of your job a little easier.Installation------------.. code:: bash   python3 -m pip install advertoolsSEM Campaigns-------------The most important thing to achieve in SEM is a proper mapping between thethree main elements of a search campaign**Keywords** (the intention) -&gt; **Ads** (your promise) -&gt; **Landing Pages** (your delivery of the promise)Once you have this done, you can focus on management and analysis. More importantly,once you know that you can set this up in an easy way, you know you can focuson more strategic issues. In practical terms you need two main tables to get started:* Keywords: You can `generate keywords &lt;https://advertools.readthedocs.io/en/master/advertools.kw_generate.html&gt;`_ (note I didn't say research)  with the  `kw_generate` function.* Ads: There are two approaches that you can use:  * Bottom-up: You can create text ads for a large number of products by simple    replacement of product names, and providing a placeholder in case your text    is too long. Check out the `ad_create &lt;https://advertools.readthedocs.io/en/master/advertools.ad_create.html&gt;`_ function for more details.  * Top-down: Sometimes you have a long description text that you want to split    into headlines, descriptions and whatever slots you want to split them into.    `ad_from_string &lt;https://advertools.readthedocs.io/en/master/advertools.ad_from_string.html&gt;`_    helps you accomplish that.* Tutorials and additional resources  * Get started with `Data Science for Digital Marketing and SEO/SEM &lt;https://www.oncrawl.com/technical-seo/data-science-seo-digital-marketing-guide-beginners/&gt;`_  * `Setting a full SEM campaign &lt;https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/sem-data-science&gt;`_ for DataCamp's website tutorial  * Project to practice `generating SEM keywords with Python &lt;https://www.datacamp.com/projects/400&gt;`_ on DataCamp  * `Setting up SEM campaigns on a large scale &lt;https://www.semrush.com/blog/setting-up-search-engine-marketing-campaigns-on-large-scale/&gt;`_ tutorial on SEMrush  * Visual `tool to generate keywords &lt;https://www.dashboardom.com/advertools&gt;`_ online based on the `kw_generate` functionSEO---Probably the most comprehensive online marketing area that is both technical(crawling, indexing, rendering, redirects, etc.) and non-technical (contentcreation, link building, outreach, etc.). Here are some tools that can helpwith your SEO* `SEO crawler: &lt;https://advertools.readthedocs.io/en/master/advertools.spider.html&gt;`_  A generic SEO crawler that can be customized, built with Scrapy, &amp; with several  features:  * Standard SEO elements extracted by default (title, header tags, body text,    status code, reponse and request headers, etc.)  * CSS and XPath selectors: You probably have more specific needs in mind, so    you can easily pass any selectors to be extracted in addition to the    standard elements being extracted  * Custom settings: full access to Scrapy's settings, allowing you to better    control the crawling behavior (set custom headers, user agent, stop spider    after x pages, seconds, megabytes, save crawl logs, run jobs at intervals    where you can stop and resume your crawls, which is ideal for large crawls    or for continuous monitoring, and many more options)  * Following links: option to only crawl a set of specified pages or to follow    and discover all pages through links* `robots.txt downloader &lt;https://advertools.readthedocs.io/en/master/advertools.sitemaps.html#advertools.sitemaps.robotstxt_to_df&gt;`_  A simple downloader of robots.txt files in a DataFrame format, so you can  keep track of changes across crawls if any, and check the rules, sitemaps,  etc.* `XML Sitemaps downloader / parser &lt;https://advertools.readthedocs.io/en/master/advertools.sitemaps.html&gt;`_  An essential part of any SEO analysis is to check XML sitemaps. This is a  simple function with which you can download one or more sitemaps (by  providing the URL for a robots.txt file, a sitemap file, or a sitemap index* `SERP importer and parser for Google &amp; YouTube &lt;https://advertools.readthedocs.io/en/master/advertools.serp.html&gt;`_  Connect to Google's API and get the search data you want. Multiple search  parameters supported, all in one function call, and all results returned in a  DataFrame* Tutorials and additional resources  * A visual tool built with the ``serp_goog`` function to get `SERP rankings on Google &lt;https://www.dashboardom.com/google-serp&gt;`_  * A tutorial on `analyzing SERPs on a large scale with Python &lt;https://www.semrush.com/blog/analyzing-search-engine-results-pages/&gt;`_ on SEMrush  * `SERP datasets on Kaggle &lt;https://www.kaggle.com/eliasdabbas/datasets?search=engine&gt;`_ for practicing on different industries and use cases  * `SERP notebooks on Kaggle &lt;https://www.kaggle.com/eliasdabbas/notebooks?sortBy=voteCount&amp;group=everyone&amp;pageSize=20&amp;userId=484496&amp;tagIds=1220&gt;`_    some examples on how you might tackle such data  * `Content Analysis with XML Sitemaps and Python &lt;https://www.semrush.com/blog/content-analysis-xml-sitemaps-python/&gt;`_  * XML dataset examples: `news sites &lt;https://www.kaggle.com/eliasdabbas/news-sitemaps&gt;`_, `Turkish news sites &lt;https://www.kaggle.com/eliasdabbas/turk-haber-sitelerinin-site-haritalari&gt;`_,    `Bloomberg news &lt;https://www.kaggle.com/eliasdabbas/bloomberg-business-articles-urls&gt;`_Text &amp; Content Analysis (for SEO &amp; Social Media)------------------------------------------------URLs, page titles, tweets, video descriptions, comments, hashtags are someexmaples of the types of text we deal with. ``advertools`` provides a fewoptions for text analysis* `Word frequency &lt;https://advertools.readthedocs.io/en/master/advertools.word_frequency.html&gt;`_  Counting words in a text list is one of the most basic and important tasks in  text mining. What is also important is counting those words by taking in  consideration their relative weights in the dataset. ``word_frequency`` does  just that.* `URL Analysis &lt;https://advertools.readthedocs.io/en/master/advertools.urlytics.html&gt;`_  We all have to handle many thousands of URLs in reports, crawls, social media  extracts, XML sitemaps and so on. ``url_to_df`` converts your URLs into  easily readable DataFrames.* `Emoji &lt;https://advertools.readthedocs.io/en/master/advertools.emoji.html&gt;`_  Produced with one click, extremely expressive, highly diverse (3k+ emoji),  and very popular, it's important to capture what people are trying to communicate  with emoji. Extracting emoji, get their names, groups, and sub-groups is  possible. The full emoji database is also available for convenience, as well  as an ``emoji_search`` function in case you want some ideas for your next  social media or any kind of communication* `extract_ functions &lt;https://advertools.readthedocs.io/en/master/advertools.extract.html&gt;`_  The text that we deal with contains many elements and entities that have  their own special meaning and usage. There is a group of convenience  functions to help in extracting and getting basic statistics about structured  entities in text; emoji, hashtags, mentions, currency, numbers, URLs, questions  and more. You can also provide a special regex for your own needs.* `Stopwords &lt;https://advertools.readthedocs.io/en/master/advertools.stopwords.html&gt;`_  A list of stopwords in forty different languages to help in text analysis.* Tutorial on DataCamp for creating the ``word_frequency`` function and  explaining the importance of the difference between `absolute and weighted word frequency &lt;https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/absolute-weighted-word-frequency&gt;`_* `Text Analysis for Online Marketers &lt;https://www.semrush.com/blog/text-analysis-for-online-marketers/&gt;`_  An introductory article on SEMrushSocial Media------------In addition to the text analysis techniques provided, you can also connect tothe Twitter and YouTube data APIs. The main benefits of using ``advertools``for this:* Handles pagination and request limits: typically every API has a limited  number of results that it returns. You have to handle pagination when you  need more than the limit per request, which you typically do. This is handled  by default* DataFrame results: APIs send you back data in a formats that need to be  parsed and cleaned so you can more easily start your analysis. This is also  handled automatically* Multiple requests: in YouTube's case you might want to request data for the  same query across several countries, languages, channels, etc. You can  specify them all in one request and get the product of all the requests in  one response* Tutorials and additional resources* A visual tool to `check what is trending on Twitter &lt;https://www.dashboardom.com/trending-twitter&gt;`_ for all available locations* A `Twitter data analysis dashboard &lt;https://www.dashboardom.com/twitterdash&gt;`_ with many options* How to use the `Twitter data API with Python &lt;https://www.kaggle.com/eliasdabbas/twitter-in-a-dataframe&gt;`_* `Extracting entities from social media posts &lt;https://www.kaggle.com/eliasdabbas/extract-entities-from-social-media-posts&gt;`_ tutorial on Kaggle* `Analyzing 131k tweets &lt;https://www.kaggle.com/eliasdabbas/extract-entities-from-social-media-posts&gt;`_ by European Football clubs tutorial on Kaggle* An overview of the `YouTube data API with Python &lt;https://www.kaggle.com/eliasdabbas/youtube-data-api&gt;`_Conventions-----------Function names mostly start with the object you are working on, so you can useautocomplete to discover other options:| ``kw_``: for keywords-related functions| ``ad_``: for ad-related functions| ``url_``: URL tracking and generation| ``extract_``: for extracting entities from social media posts (mentions, hashtags, emoji, etc.)| ``emoji_``: emoji related functions and objects| ``twitter``: a module for querying the Twitter API and getting results in a DataFrame| ``youtube``: a module for querying the YouTube Data API and getting results in a DataFrame| ``serp_``: get search engine results pages in a DataFrame, currently available: Google and YouTube| ``crawl``: a function you will probably use a lot if you do SEO| ``*_to_df``: a set of convenience functions for converting to DataFrames  (log files, XML sitemaps, robots.txt files, and lists of URLs)=======================Change Log - advertools=======================0.13.3 (2023-06-27)-------------------* Changed    - Allow optional trailing space in log files (contributed by @andypayne)* Fixed    - Replace newlines with spaces while parsing JSON-LD which was causing       errors in some cases.0.13.2 (2022-09-30)-------------------* Added    - Crawling recipe for how to use the ``DEFAULT_REQUEST_HEADERS`` to change      the default headers.* Changed    - Split long lists of URL while crawling regardless of the ``follow_links``      parameter* Fixed    - Clarify that while authenticating for Twitter only ``app_key`` and       ``app_secret`` are required, with the option to provide ``oauth_token``      and ``oauth_token_secret`` if/when needed.0.13.1 (2022-05-11)-------------------* Added    - Command line interface with most functions    - Make documentation interactive for most pages using ``thebe-sphinx``* Changed    - Use `np.nan` wherever there are missing values in ``url_to_df``* Fixed    - Don't remove double quotes from etags when downloading XML sitemaps    - Replace instances of ``pd.DataFrame.append`` with ``pd.concat``, which is      depracated.    - Replace empty values with np.nan for the size column in ``logs_to_df``0.13.0 (2022-02-10)-------------------* Added    - New function ``crawl_headers``: A crawler that only makes `HEAD` requests      to a known list of URLs.    - New function ``reverse_dns_lookup``: A way to get host information for a      large list of IP addresses concurrently.    - New options for crawling: `exclude_url_params`, `include_url_params`,      `exclude_url_regex`, and `include_url_regex` for controlling which links to      follow while crawling.* Fixed    - Any ``custom_settings`` options given to the ``crawl`` function that were      defined using a dictionary can now be set without issues.

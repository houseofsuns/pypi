	<longdescription># pybloomfiltermmap3[pybloomfiltermmap3](https://github.com/prashnts/pybloomfiltermmap3) is a Python 3 compatible fork of [pybloomfiltermmap](https://github.com/axiak/pybloomfiltermmap) by [@axiak](https://github.com/axiak).The goal of `pybloomfiltermmap3` is simple: to provide a fast, simple, scalable, correct library for Bloom filters in Python.[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PrashntS/pybloomfiltermmap3.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PrashntS/pybloomfiltermmap3)[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pybloomfiltermmap3/badge/?version=latest)](https://pybloomfiltermmap3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pybloomfiltermmap3.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pybloomfiltermmap3)[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dw/pybloomfiltermmap3.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pybloomfiltermmap3)[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pybloomfiltermmap3.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pybloomfiltermmap3)## Why pybloomfiltermmap3?There are a couple reasons to use this module:* It natively uses [mmaped files](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mmap).* It is fast (see [benchmarks](http://axiak.github.io/pybloomfiltermmap/#benchmarks)).* It natively does the set things you want a Bloom filter to do.## QuickstartAfter you install, the interface to use is a cross between a fileinterface and an ste interface. As an example:```python    &gt;&gt;&gt; import pybloomfilter    &gt;&gt;&gt; fruit = pybloomfilter.BloomFilter(100000, 0.1, '/tmp/words.bloom')    &gt;&gt;&gt; fruit.update(('apple', 'pear', 'orange', 'apple'))    &gt;&gt;&gt; len(fruit)    3    &gt;&gt;&gt; 'mike' in fruit    False    &gt;&gt;&gt; 'apple' in fruit    True```To create an in-memory filter, simply omit the file location:```python    &gt;&gt;&gt; cakes = pybloomfilter.BloomFilter(10000, 0.1)```*Caveat*: it is currently not possible to persist this filter later.## DocsCurrent docs are available at [pybloomfiltermmap3.rtfd.io](https://pybloomfiltermmap3.readthedocs.io/en/latest).## InstallTo install:```shell    $ pip install pybloomfiltermmap3```and you should be set.### Note to Python 2 to &lt; 3.5 usersThis library is specifically meant for Python 3.5 and above. [As of 2020](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/), we strongly advise you to switch to an actively maintained distribution of Python 3. If for any reason your current environment is restricted to Python 2, please see [pybloomfiltermmap](https://github.com/axiak/pybloomfiltermmap). Please note that the latter is not actively maintained and will lack bug fixes and new features.## History and Future[pybloomfiltermmap](https://github.com/axiak/pybloomfiltermmap) is an excellent Bloom filter implementation for Python 2 by [@axiak](https://github.com/axiak) and contributors. I, [@prashnts](https://github.com/prashnts), made initial changes to add support for Python 3 sometime in 2016 as the current [pybloomfiltermmap3](https://pypi.org/project/pybloomfiltermmap3/) on `PyPI`. Since then, with the help of contributors, there have been incremental improvements and bug fixes while maintaining the API from versions `0.4.x` and below.Some new features and changes were first introduced in version `0.5.0`. From this point on, the goal is to reach stability, as well as add a few more APIs to expand upon the use cases. While we can't guarantee that we won't change the current interface, the transition from versions `0.4.x` and below should be quick one liners. Please open an issue if we broke your build!Suggestions, bug reports, and / or patches are welcome!## Contributions and developmentWhen contributing, you should set up an appropriate Python 3 environment and install the dependencies listed in `requirements-dev.txt`.Package installation depends on a generated `pybloomfilter.c` file, which requires Cython module to be in your current environment.## Maintainers* [Prashant Sinha](https://github.com/prashnts)* [Vytautas Mizgiris](https://github.com/vmizg)## LicenseSee the LICENSE file.

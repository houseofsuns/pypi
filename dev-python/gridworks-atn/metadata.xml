They are what make electrical devices_transactive_. More specifically, each AtomicTNode is dedicated to the job of operating its very own[Transactive Device](https://gridworks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/transactive-device.html), and simultaneously bidding on its behalf into electricity markets.To learn about using this SDK, visit the [Gridworks Atn docs](https://gridworks-atn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

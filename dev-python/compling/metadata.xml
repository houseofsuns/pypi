	<longdescription># compling#### Computational Linguistic with Python[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)**compling** is a Python module that provides some **_Natural Language Processing_** and **_Computational Linguistics_** functionalities to work with human language data. It incorporates various _Data_ and _Text Mining_ features from other famous libraries (e.g. [spacy](https://pypi.org/project/spacy/), [nltk](https://pypi.org/project/nltk/), [sklearn](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/), ...) in order to arrange a pipeline aimed at the analysis of corpora of _JSON_ documents.### Documentation See documentation [here](http://pycompling.altervista.org/).### InstallationYou can install **compling** with:```sh$ pip install compling```**compling** requires:+ _Python_ (&gt;= 3.6)+ _numpy_+ _spacy_+ _nltk_+ _gensim_+ _tqdm_+ _unicodedata2_+ _unidecode_+ configparser_+ _vaderSentiment_+ _wordcloud_You also need to download:* a ++_spacy language model_++ &lt;br/&gt;See [here](https://spacy.io/models) the available models. You can choose based on the language of your corpus documents. By default, **complig** expects you to download _sm_ models. You can still choose to download larger models, but remember to edit the [_confg.ini_](#config.ini) file, so it can work properly.    _Example_ &lt;br/&gt;    Let's assume the language of your documents is _English_.     You could download the _spacy small english model_:    ```sh    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm    ```* some ++_nltk functionalities_++: &lt;br/&gt;    * _stopwords_        ```sh        $ python -m nltk.downloader stopwords        ```    * _punkt_        ```sh        $ python -m nltk.downloader punkt        ```### config.iniThe functionalities offered by **compling** may require a large variety of parameters. To facilitate their use, default values are provided for some parameters:- some can be changed in the function invocation. Many functions provide optional parameters;- others are stored in the ++_config.ini_++ file.  This file configures the processing of your corpora. It contains the values of some special parameters.   (e.g. _the language of documents in your corpus._)You can see a preview below:```ini[Corpus];The language of documents in your corpus.language = english;Documents in your corpus store their text in this key.text_key = text;Documents in your corpus store their date values as string in this format.;For a complete list of formatting directives, see: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior.date_format = %d/%m/%Y;The size of spacy model you want it to be used in the text processingspacy_model_size = md[Document_record];Document records metadata:;If lower==1, A lowercase version will be stored for each document.lower = 0;If lemma==1, A version with tokens replace by their lemma will be stored for each document.lemma = 0;If stem==1, A version with tokens replace by their stem will be stored for each document.stem = 0;If negations==1, A version where negated token are preceded by 'NOT_' prefix will be stored for each document.negations = 1;If named_entities==1, the occurring named entities will be stored in a list for each document.named_entities = 1; ...```##### ConfigManager**compling** provides the _ConfigManager_ class to make it easier for you to edit the _config.ini_ file and to help you handling the corpora processing .#### example of usage (compling)You can see a short example of usage at [https://github.com/FrancescoPeriti/compling](https://github.com/FrancescoPeriti/compling). See the [documentation](http://pycompling.altervista.org/) for more details.</longdescription>

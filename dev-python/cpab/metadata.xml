The regular grid has 100 equally spaced points. .. code-block:: python    T.visualize_tesselation().. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imartinezl/cpab/master/docs/source/_static/figures/visualize_tesselation.png    :align: center    :width: 500The velocity field is formed by a continuous piecewise affine function defined over 5 intervals. The parameters ``theta`` represent a basis of the null space for all continuous piecewise affine functions composed of 5 intervals. In this case, we have used the QR decomposition to build the basis. See the API documentation for more details about the transformation options.Taking into account the zero velocity constraints at the boundary, only 4 dimensions or degree of freedom are left to play with, and that indeed is the dimensionality of ``theta``, a vector of 4 values... code-block:: python    T.visualize_velocity(theta).. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imartinezl/cpab/master/docs/source/_static/figures/visualize_velocity.png    :align: center    :width: 500We can visualize the generated transformation based on the parameters ``theta``:.. code-block:: python    T.visualize_deformgrid(theta).. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imartinezl/cpab/master/docs/source/_static/figures/visualize_deformgrid.png    :align: center    :width: 500In addition, for optimization tasks, it is useful to obtain the gradient of the transformation with respect to parameters ``theta``. The gradient function can be obtained in closed-form solution. There are 4 different functions, one per dimension in ``theta``:.. code-block:: python    T.visualize_gradient(theta).. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imartinezl/cpab/master/docs/source/_static/figures/visualize_gradient.png    :align: center    :width: 500Citations---------This repository was presented at the International Conference of Machine Learning (ICML 2022). .. sourcecode:: bibtex    @inproceedings{martinez2022closed,        title={Closed-Form Diffeomorphic Transformations for Time Series Alignment},        author={Martinez, I{\~n}igo and Viles, Elisabeth and Olaizola, Igor G},        booktitle={International Conference on Machine Learning},        pages={15122--15158},        year={2022},        organization={PMLR}    }Furthermore, please cite previous articles by Freifeld et al. that are essential to this work... sourcecode:: bibtex    @article{freifeld2017transformations,        title={Transformations based on continuous piecewise-affine velocity fields},        author={Freifeld, Oren and Hauberg, S{\o}ren and Batmanghelich, Kayhan and Fisher, Jonn W},        journal={IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence},        volume={39},        number={12},        pages={2496--2509},        year={2017},        publisher={IEEE}    }    @inproceedings{freifeld2015highly,        title={Highly-expressive spaces of well-behaved transformations: Keeping it simple},        author={Freifeld, Oren and Hauberg, Soren and Batmanghelich, Kayhan and Fisher, John W},        booktitle={Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision},        pages={2911--2919},        year={2015}    }Installation------------As the compiled **cpab** package is hosted on the Python Package Index (PyPI) you can easily install it with ``pip``.To install **cpab**, run this command in your terminal of choice:.. code-block:: shell-session    $ pip install cpabor, alternatively:.. code-block:: shell-session    $ python -m pip install cpabIf you want to get **cpab**'s latest version, you can refer to therepository hosted at github:.. code-block:: shell-session    python -m pip install https://github.com/imartinezl/cpab/archive/master.zipEnvironment Setup-----------------Requirements^^^^^^^^^^^^**cpab** builds on ``numpy``, ``torch``, ``scipy``, ``ninja``,  and ``matplotlib`` libraries.Python 3^^^^^^^^To find out which version of ``python`` you have, open a terminal window and try the following command:.. code-block:: shell-session    $ python3 --version    Python 3.6.9If you have ``python3`` on your machine, then this command should respond with a version number. If you do not have ``python3`` installed, follow these `instructions &lt;https://realpython.com/installing-python&gt;`_.Pip^^^``pip`` is the reference Python package manager. It’s used to install and update packages. In case ``pip`` is not installed in your OS, follow these `procedure &lt;https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/&gt;`_.Virtual Environment^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^``venv`` creates a “virtual” isolated Python installation and installs packages into that virtual installation. It is always recommended to use a virtual environment while developing Python applications. To create a virtual environment, go to your project’s directory and run venv... code-block:: shell-session    $ python3 -m venv envBefore you can start installing or using packages in your virtual environment you’ll need to activate it. .. code-block:: shell-session    $ source env/bin/activateSource Code-----------cpab is developed on GitHub, where the code is`always available &lt;https://github.com/imartinezl/cpab&gt;`_.You can either clone the public repository:.. code-block:: shell-session    $ git clone git://github.com/imartinezl/cpab.gitOr, download the `tarball &lt;https://github.com/imartinezl/cpab/tarball/main&gt;`_:.. code-block:: shell-session    $ curl -OL https://github.com/imartinezl/cpab/tarball/main    # optionally, zipball is also available (for Windows users).Once you have a copy of the source, you can embed it in your own Pythonpackage, or install it into your site-packages easily:.. code-block:: shell-session    $ cd cpab    $ python -m pip install .MIT LicenseCopyright (c) 2021 Iñigo MartínezPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copyof this software and associated documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to dealin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rightsto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sellcopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software isfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in allcopies or substantial portions of the Software.THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS ORIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

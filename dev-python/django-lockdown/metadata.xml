Add ``'lockdown'`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``.   If you want to use one of ``django-lockdowns`` default lock down forms,   you'll additionally have to ensure that you have enabled   ``django.contrib.auth`` as part of to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``.2. To enable admin preview of locked-down sites or views with   passwords, set the `LOCKDOWN_PASSWORDS`_ setting to a tuple of one or   more plain-text passwords.3. Protect the entire site by using middleware, or protect individual views   by applying a decorator to them.For more advanced customization of admin preview authorization, seethe `LOCKDOWN_FORM`_ setting.Dependencies------------``django-lockdown`` requires `Python`_ 3.6 or later and `Django`_ 2.2 or later.As an alternative to CPython `PyPy`_ 3.5 and 3.6 are supported as well... _Python: https://www.python.org/.. _Django: https://www.djangoproject.com/.. _PyPy: https://pypy.org/Usage=====Using the middleware--------------------To lock down the entire site, add the lockdown middleware to your middlewares::    MIDDLEWARE = [        # ...        'lockdown.middleware.LockdownMiddleware',    ]Optionally, you may also add URL regular expressions to a`LOCKDOWN_URL_EXCEPTIONS`_ setting.Using the decorator-------------------- Import the decorator::    from lockdown.decorators import lockdown- Apply the decorator to individual views you want to protect. For example::    @lockdown()    def secret_page(request):        # ...The decorator accepts seven arguments:``form``  The form to use for providing an admin preview, rather than the form  referenced by `LOCKDOWN_FORM`_. Note that this must be an actual form class,  not a module reference like the setting.``until_date``  The date to use rather than the date provided by `LOCKDOWN_UNTIL`_.``after_date``  The date to use rather than the date provided by `LOCKDOWN_AFTER`_.``logout_key``  A preview logout key to use, rather than the one provided by  `LOCKDOWN_LOGOUT_KEY`_.``session_key``  The session key to use, rather than the one provided by  `LOCKDOWN_SESSION_KEY`_.``url_exceptions``  A list of regular expressions for which matching urls can bypass the lockdown  (rather than using those defined in `LOCKDOWN_URL_EXCEPTIONS`_).``remote_addr_exceptions`` A list of IP-addresses or IP-subnets for which matching URLs can bypass the lockdown (rather than using those defined in `LOCKDOWN_REMOTE_ADDR_EXCEPTIONS`_).``extra_context``  A dictionary of context data that will be added to the default context data  passed to the template.Any further keyword arguments are passed to the admin preview form. The defaultform accepts one argument:``passwords``  A tuple of passwords to use, rather than the ones provided by  `LOCKDOWN_PASSWORDS`_.Settings========LOCKDOWN_ENABLED----------------An optional boolean value that, if set to False, disables``django-lockdown`` globally. Defaults to True (lock down enabled).LOCKDOWN_PASSWORDS------------------One or more plain-text passwords which allow the previewing of the site orviews protected by django-lockdown::    LOCKDOWN_PASSWORDS = ('letmein', 'beta')If this setting is not provided (and the default `LOCKDOWN_FORM`_ is beingused), there will be no admin preview for locked-down pages.If a `LOCKDOWN_FORM`_ other than the default is used, this setting has noeffect.LOCKDOWN_URL_EXCEPTIONS-----------------------An optional list/tuple of regular expressions to be matched against incomingURLs. If a URL matches a regular expression in this list, it will not belocked. For example::    LOCKDOWN_URL_EXCEPTIONS = (        r'^/about/$',   # unlock /about/        r'\.json$',   # unlock JSON API    )LOCKDOWN_VIEW_EXCEPTIONS------------------------An optional list of regular expressions to be matched against theresolved views of incoming requests. If the URL of an incoming requestresolves to one of the views in the list, it will not be locked.That's useful if you want to lock down a whole site using the middleware,but want to whitelist some localized URLs.For example::    from yourapp import one_view_to_unlock, another_view_to_unlock    LOCKDOWN_VIEW_EXCEPTIONS = [        one_view_to_unlock,        another_view_to_unlock    ]LOCKDOWN_REMOTE_ADDR_EXCEPTIONS-------------------------------An optional list of IP-addresses or IP-subnets to be matched against therequesting IP-address (from `requests.META['REMOTE_ADDR']`). If therequesting IP-address is in this list, it will not be locked. For example::    LOCKDOWN_REMOTE_ADDR_EXCEPTIONS = [        '127.0.0.1',        '::1',    ]LOCKDOWN_TRUSTED_PROXIES-------------------------------A list of trusted proxy IP-addresses to be used in conjunction with `LOCKDOWN_REMOTE_ADDR_EXCEPTIONS` when a reverse-proxy or load balancer is used.If the requesting IP address is from the trusted proxies list the last address from the `X-Forwared-For` header (from `requests.META['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR']`) will be checked against `LOCKDOWN_REMOTE_ADDR_EXCEPTIONS` and locked or unlocked accordingly.For example::    LOCKDOWN_TRUSTED_PROXIES = [        '172.17.0.1',    ]    LOCKDOWN_REMOTE_ADDR_EXCEPTIONS = [        '172.17.0.5',    ]LOCKDOWN_UNTIL--------------Used to lock the site down up until a certain date. Set to a``datetime.datetime`` object.If neither ``LOCKDOWN_UNTIL`` nor `LOCKDOWN_AFTER`_ is provided (the default),the site or views will always be locked.LOCKDOWN_AFTER--------------Used to lock the site down after a certain date. Set to a ``datetime.datetime``object.See also: `LOCKDOWN_UNTIL`_.LOCKDOWN_LOGOUT_KEY-------------------A key which, if provided in the query string of a locked URL, will log out theuser from the preview. LOCKDOWN_FORM-------------The default lockdown form allows admin preview by entering a presetplain-text password (checked, by default, against the `LOCKDOWN_PASSWORDS`_setting). To set up more advanced methods of authenticating access tolocked-down pages, set ``LOCKDOWN_FORM`` to the Python dotted path to a Django``Form`` subclass. This form will be displayed on the lockout page. If the formvalidates when submitted, the user will be allowed access to locked pages::    LOCKDOWN_FORM = 'path.to.my.CustomLockdownForm'A form for authenticating against ``django.contrib.auth`` users is providedwith django-lockdown (use ``LOCKDOWN_FORM = 'lockdown.forms.AuthForm'``). Itaccepts two keyword arguments (in the ``lockdown`` decorator):``staff_only``  Only allow staff members to preview. Defaults to ``True`` (but the default  can be provided as a `LOCKDOWN_AUTHFORM_STAFF_ONLY`_ setting).``superusers_only``  Only allow superusers to preview. Defaults to ``False`` (but the default  can be provided as a `LOCKDOWN_AUTHFORM_SUPERUSERS_ONLY`_ setting).LOCKDOWN_AUTHFORM_STAFF_ONLY----------------------------If using ``lockdown.forms.AuthForm`` and this setting is ``True``, only staffusers will be allowed to preview (True by default).Has no effect if not using ``lockdown.forms.AuthForm``.LOCKDOWN_AUTHFORM_SUPERUSERS_ONLY---------------------------------If using ``lockdown.forms.AuthForm`` and this setting is ``True``, onlysuperusers will be allowed to preview (False by default). Has no effect if notusing ``lockdown.forms.AuthForm``.LOCKDOWN_SESSION_KEY--------------------Once a client is authorized for admin preview, they will continue tobe authorized for the remainder of their browsing session (usingDjango's built-in session support). ``LOCKDOWN_SESSION_KEY`` definesthe session key used; the default is ``'lockdown-allow'``.Templates=========``django-lockdown`` uses a single template, ``lockdown/form.html``. Thedefault template displays a simple &quot;coming soon&quot; message and thepreview authorization form, if a password via `LOCKDOWN_PASSWORDS`_ is set.If you want to use a different template, you can use Djangos template`loaders`_ to specify a path inside your project to search for templates,before searching for templates included in ``django-lockdown``.In your overwritten template the lockdown preview form is available in thetemplate context as ``form``... _loaders: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/templates/api/#template-loadersCHANGES=======4.0.0 (2021-02-14)------------------- Remove support for end-of-life Django versions (1.11, 2.0 and 2.1).- Add support for Python 3.9 and remove support for Python 3.5.- Add support for Django 3.1.3.0.0.

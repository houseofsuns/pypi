It provides components for modeling lines, registers, blocks and sections in a declarative way and aggregate these blocks as components for defining files.Suppose that a complex text file needs to be parsed and the contents of lines with a specific identifier must be extracted and validated. For instance, the line follows the format:```DATA_HIGH  ID001   sudo.user  10/20/2025  901.25```If `DATA_HIGH` is the identifier that specifies the lines to be read, than one can model it with the `Register` class in the `cfinterface` framework.```pythonclass DATA_HIGH(Register):    IDENTIFIER = &quot;DATA_HIGH&quot;    IDENTIFIER_DIGITS = 9    LINE = Line(        [            LiteralField(size=6, starting_position=11),            LiteralField(size=9, starting_position=19),            DatetimeField(size=10, starting_position=30, format=&quot;%M/$d/%Y&quot;),            FloatField(size=6, starting_position=42, decimal_digits=2),        ]    )```A `Register` depends on the definition of a `Line` object, that is composed of `Field` objects. By modeling these elements on a declarative way, the user gains access to reading / writing functions on the fly, and the `Register` may be added to a `RegisterFile` object, so that it can be read / written together with many other registers to files.Despite the `Register` model, files can also be composed of `Blocks` and `Sections`, and their interfaces can be done to `text` or `binary` formats. For more information, the docs are available [here](https://rjmalves.github.io/cfi).## Install`cfinterface` requires python &gt;= 3.7. It this requirement is met, than one may install the framework with```python -m pip install cfinterface```## DocumentationGuides, tutorials and references may be found at the package's official site: https://rjmalves.github.io/cfi</longdescription>

	<longdescription>ASCII Designer==============A library that:* creates GUI from ASCII-art (with well-defined syntax)* maps widgets to virtual class attributes* relieves you from the boring parts of Form building while leaving you in   control.Did you ever design a form by scribbling something like this in your editor::        Text to transform:   [ Text_      ]                Select transformation:                (x) Uppercase        ( ) Lowercase        ( ) Title-case                    [ OK ]            [ Cancel ]... and wished that you could be done with design and start coding? Wish no longer::    from ascii_designer import AutoFrame    class TextTransformer(AutoFrame):        f_body='''                                |    &lt;-&gt;       |            Text to transform:   [ Text_      ]                        Select transformation:                        (x) Uppercase            ( ) Lowercase            ( ) Title-case                            [ OK ]            [ Cancel ]~        '''        def ok(self):            text = self.text            if self.uppercase:                text = text.upper()            elif self.lowercase:                text = text.lower()            elif self.titlecase:                text = text.title()            print(text)            self.close()                    def cancel(self):            self.close()                if __name__ == '__main__':        TextTransformer().f_show()Some comments, incidentally highlighting the features of this library:* As you probably guessed, all the magic happens in ``AutoFrame``. The   ``f_show`` call triggers rendering of the form. All the reserved attributes   are prepended with ``f_`` to get out of your way when subclassing.* There is a **well-defined syntax** for how to get the usual widget types. In the   example you can find labels (plain text), a text box, radio buttons and normal   buttons.* The columns are defined by the **header row** with the pipe characters. The   minus sign denotes stretching columns. (The ``&lt;`` / ``&gt;`` chars are just   decoration.)* **Column-span** is easily done by having not-a-space underneath the pipe   symbol. **Row-span** can also be done by prepending subsequent cells with a   ``{`` character.* **Anchoring** is controlled by whether the cell is space-padded or not. For   example, the Text box stretches, while the cancel button is centered. The   tilde character can be used instead of a fragile trailing space.* **Widget IDs** are automatically generated by lowercasing and whitelisting the   captions.* If a method exists with the same name as a widget id, it is **automatically   bound** to the usually-wanted event (click in case of button, value-changed in   case of basically anything else). Oh, and ``close`` and ``quit`` are already   there for your convenience.* Otherwise, you can retrieve and set the widget's value by using its id like  a class **attribute**.* ``f_show()`` captures all the usual boilerplate and simply f***ing shows   the frame. It can be used for both the toplevel and additional frames.* Also note how the class name automatically turned into the window title.   Override by setting ``.f_title``.* The created widgets are **&quot;raw&quot;, native widgets**. You can configure the toolkit   to use. Currently there is a Qt and a Tkinter implementation. The native   widget can accessed using ``form[&quot;widget_id&quot;]`` (or   ``form.f_controls[&quot;widget_id&quot;]``).     The general philosophy is to not paint everything over with wrappers. Instead, the library focuses on specific tasks - building the layout, event-/value binding - and lets you do everything else with the API you know and (maybe) love.    INSTALLATION------------::    pip install ascii_designer    Requirements: Python &gt;= 3, ``attrs``. To use the Qt toolkit you need ``qtpy``.

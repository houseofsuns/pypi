It is designed to intelligently process text input containing the chemical formula and provide associated information on the inquired molecule. It is able to provide the molar mass, check a formula's validity, and provide a balanced combustion equation if the input is combustible. This tool can be utilized for various educational and research purposes for simple and fast information retrieval.We are using a dataset that contains established element data properties from [this site](https://github.com/Bluegrams/periodic-table-data/blob/master/Periodica.Data/Data/ElementData.csv).## Installation`chembox` is developed and tested on Python 3.10. You can install it from PyPi via pip:```bash$ pip install chembox```## UsageThe package includes 4 functions for solving chemistry problems:- `get_elements`a parser that takes a chemical formula in string format and returns a dictionary that contains the elements and their respective count. - `is_valid`: a checker that returns a boolean indicating whether a given input is chemically reasonable.- `get_molec_props`: a method that takes a chemical formula in string format and returns a dataframe with various useful properties of each element in the formula.- `get_combustion_equation`: a method that takes a text chemical formula that only contains carbon (`C`) and hydrogen (`H`) and outputs a balanced equation resulting from combustion.A detailed example of usage can be found [here](https://chembox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example.html).## DatasetIn order to be able to perform some of the functions above, a dataset will need to be used that contains various atomic properties of the elements in the periodic table. The data can be found in the Chembox repo [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/chembox/tree/main/src/chembox/data) which was sourced from [here](https://github.com/Bluegrams/periodic-table-data/tree/master/Periodica.Data/Data). Please note that we do not take credit for the dataset, it is merely for use with our functions.## Fitting into the Python ecosystemA similar package [chemsolve](https://github.com/amogh7joshi/chemsolve) is available online that employs a similar string-parsing design and molar mass calculation.What we do differently:- We include a dataframe of the molecule properties to give the user enhanced functionality and insights.- `chemsolve` accepts user-defined reactions. In our package, we include methods for automated combustion equation generation and balancing.## ContributingInterested in contributing? Check out the contributing guidelines.

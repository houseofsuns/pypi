	<longdescription># Kodexa[![Build and Package with Poetry](https://github.com/kodexa-ai/kodexa/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/kodexa-ai/kodexa/actions/workflows/main.yml)![img.png](https://docs.kodexa.com/img.png)Kodexa is a platform for building intelligent document processing pipelines. It is a set of tools and services thatallow you to build a pipeline that can take a document, extract the content, and then process it to extract theinformation you need.It is built on a set of core principles:* **Document Centric** - Kodexa is built around the idea of a document. A document is a collection of content  nodes that are connected together. This is a powerful model that allows you to build pipelines that can  extract content from a wide range of sources.* **Pipeline Oriented** - Kodexa is built around the idea of a pipeline. A pipeline is a series of steps that  can be executed on a document. This allows you to build a pipeline that can extract content from a wide range  of sources.* **Extensible** - Kodexa is built around the idea of a pipeline. A pipeline is a series of steps that can be executed  on a document. This allows you to build a pipeline that can extract content from a wide range of sources.* **Label Driven** - Kodexa focuses on the idea of labels. Labels are a way to identify content within a document  and then use that content to drive the processing of the document.# Python SDKThis repository contains the Python SDK for Kodexa. The SDK is the primary way to interact with Kodexa. It allows you todefine actions, models, and pipelines that can be executed on Kodexa. It also includes a complete SDK client forworking with a Kodexa platform instance.## Documentation &amp; ExamplesDocumentation is available at the [Kodexa Documentation Portal](https://docs.kodexa.com)## Current Development[//]: # (Replace it with the diagrams and descriptions for build releases)**BUILD VERSION FLOW**![build-version-flow.png](docs%2Fbuild-version-flow.png)Build version will differ based on the branches that are published to pypi.**GITHUB PROCESS**![github-process.png](docs%2Fgithub-process.png)Changes that contain bugs, features, and fixes should first be pushed to the test branch. Once these changes are thoroughly tested, they can be submitted as a pull request to the main branch. The pull request should be reviewed and approved by an appropriate person before the changes can be merged.## Set-upWe use poetry to manage our dependencies, so you can install them with:    poetry installYou can then run the tests with:    poetry run pytest# ContributingWe welcome contributions to the Kodexa platform.

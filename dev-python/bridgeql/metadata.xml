	<longdescription># BridgeQL`bridgeql` is part of VMware's support for open source developmentand community.A library which will add feature to serve your model over rest API* This will allow users to make ORM query based on any models present in the django app* This will ask user to provide request in defined format and will serve the API response as json data* This will allow users to make filter, selection, ordering, slicing and count of model objectsAs of today we only support for [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), will add support for [sqlalchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) soon.## License`bridgeql` is release under the BSD-2 license, see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-2-Clause## Django Integration### InstallationYou can install it directly from [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/bridgeql/) using```shellpip install bridgeql```The bridgeql library can be integrated to the Django app by editing settingsfile by including `bridgeql` in the `settings.INSTALLED_APPS` variable.Another change required is to add a url to your existing project as```    projectname/projectname/settings.py``````pythonINSTALLED_APPS = [    ...    'bridgeql',    ...    ]```**URLs Configuration**In your project you can edit `urls.py`, to include the `bridgeql` urls.```pythonfrom bridgeql.django import urls as bridgeql_urls...urlpatterns = [    ...    path('api/bridgeql/', include(bridgeql_urls)),    ...]...```This way your app will be ready to serve the REST API to expose model query, you can request an API like follows:```python    params = {       'db_name': 'db1',       'app_name': 'machine', # required       'model_name': 'Machine', # required       'filter': {           'os__name': 'os-name-1'        },        'fields': ['ip', 'name', 'id'],        'exclude': {           'name': 'machine-name-11'        },        'order_by': ['ip'],        'limit': 5,        'offset': 10, # default 0    }    api_url = '&lt;yoursite.com&gt;/api/bridgeql/dj_read'    resp = make_get_api_call(api_url, {'payload': json.dumps(params)})    result = resp.json()```The above parameters will translate into running the model query for `Machine` model of `machine` django app.```pythonMachine.objects.using('db1')                .filter(os__name = 'os-name-1')                .exclude(name = 'machine-name-11')                .values(['ip', 'name', 'id'])                .order_by('ip')[10:15] # offset: offset + limit```____### BridgeQL SettingsSettings available in `BridgeQL` and their default values**BRIDGEQL_ALLOWED_APPS**Default: `[list of local apps]` (list)By default, it will try to lookup your local apps for the project, considering `settings.BASE_DIR` or `settings.SITE_ROOT` (whichever is found) as your project root directory. If none of this will be available, `WARNING` will be there to setup `BRIDGEQL_ALLOWED_APPS` as application starts up.Adding values as list of desired apps to `BRIDGEQL_ALLOWED_APPS` will allow you expose models only for the selected apps.This way you can add django backend apps as well as third party apps e.g. `django.contrib.auth` which can expose `User` model.You can combine next settings `BRIDGEQL_RESTRICTED_MODELS` to restrict few columns of that particular model e.g `password`.```pythonBRIDGEQL_ALLOWED_APPS = ['machine', 'django.contrib.auth']```______**BRIDGEQL_RESTRICTED_MODELS**Default: `{}` (Empty dictionary)Dictionary mapping **app_label.model_name** strings to list/bool(True). The value represents list of fields to be restricted for the model as provided in key. If the value is set to `True`, all the fields of that model will be restricted to lookup.```pythonBRIDGEQL_RESTRICTED_MODELS = {    'auth.User': True,    'machine.OperatingSystem': ['license_key'],}```______**BRIDGEQL_AUTHENTICATION_DECORATOR**Default: ```{  'reader': '',  'writer': ''}```Above setting allows you to use an authentication decorator to authenticate your client's requests.You can provide a custom authentication decorator, for reader and writer separately, whichever suits your application usecase, e.g login_required, same_subnet, etc.Default value for `BRIDGEQL_AUTHENTICATION_DECORATOR` will allow you to access API without authentication.```pythonBRIDGEQL_AUTHENTICATION_DECORATOR = {    'reader': 'bridgeql.auth.basic_auth',    'writer': 'bridgeql.auth.basic_auth'}````bridgeql.auth.basic_auth` is available as a basic authentication method where you can pass authorization header as `Authorization: Basic base64(username:password)` for each request.____### Build &amp; Run1. make test2. source venv/bin/activate &amp;&amp; tox3. python -m pip install --upgrade build4. python -m build## Documentation## ContributingThe bridgeql project team welcomes contributions from the community.

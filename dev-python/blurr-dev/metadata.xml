The BTS merges the schema and computation model for data processing.The BTS is a __data transform definition__ for structured data. The BTS encapsulates the *business logic* of data transforms and Blurr orchestrates the *execution* of data transforms. Blurr is runner-agnostic, so BTSs can be run by event processors such as Spark, Spark Streaming or Flink.# Is Blurr for you?Yes, if: you are well on your way on the ML 'curve of enlightenment', and are thinking about how to do online scoring![Curve](docs/images/curve.png)# Playground[Launch playground](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XU8G7as4cuPYqcoV5rJAd8yMuXUPXU8Q)# Tutorial and Docs&gt;Coming up with features is difficult, time-consuming, requires expert knowledge.

We are so glad that you share our passion for building MLOps!Please create a [new issue](https://github.com/productml/blurr/issues/new) to begin a discussion. Alternatively, feel free to pick up an existing issue!Please sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeUP5RFuXH0Kbi4CnV6V3IZ-xyJmd3KQP_2Ij-pTvN-_h7wUg/viewform) before raising a pull request.# Data Science 'Joel Test'Inspired by the (old school) [Joel Test](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/) to rate software teams, here's our version for data science teams. What's your score?1. Data pipelines are versioned and reproducible2. Pipelines (re)build in one step3. Deploying to production needs minimal engineering help4. Successful ML is a long game. You play it like it is5. Kaizen. Experimentation and iterations are a way of life# RoadmapBlurr is currently in Developer Preview. __Stay in touch!__: Star this project or email hello@blurr.ai- ~~Local transformations only~~- ~~Support for custom functions and other python libraries in the BTS~~- ~~Spark runner~~- S3 support for data sink- DynamoDB as an Intermediate Store- Features server</longdescription>

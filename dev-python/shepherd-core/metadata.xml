Most functionality is showcased there. The [extra](https://github.com/orgua/shepherd-datalib/tree/main/shepherd_core/extra)-directory holds data-generators relevant for the testbed. Notably is a trafficbench-experiment that's used to derive the link-matrix.### Data-Models in Detail- new orchestration ``/data-models`` with focus on remote shepherd-testbed- classes of sub-models  - ``/base``: base-classes, configuration and -functionality for all models  - ``/testbed``: meta-data representation of all testbed-components  - ``/content``: reusable meta-data for fw, h5 and vsrc-definitions  - ``/experiment``: configuration-models including sub-systems  - ``/task``: digestible configs for shepherd-herd or -sheep  - behavior controlled by ``ShpModel`` and ``content``-model- a basic database is available as fixtures through a ``tb_client``  - fixtures selectable by name &amp; ID  - fixtures support inheritance- models support  - auto-completion with neutral / sensible values  - complex and custom datatypes (i.e. PositiveInt, lists-checks on length)  - checking of inputs and type-casting  - generate their own schema (for web-forms)  - pre-validation  - store to &amp; load from yaml with typecheck through wrapper  - documentation- experiment-definition is designed securely  - types are limited in size (str)  - exposes no internal paths- experiments can be transformed to task-sets (``TestbedTasks.from_xp()``)## InstallationThe Library is available via PyPI and can be installed with```shell  pip install shepherd-core -U  # or for the full experience (includes core)  pip install shepherd-data -U```For bleeding-edge-features or dev-work it is possible to install directly from GitHub-Sources (here `dev`-branch):```Shellpip install git+https://github.com/orgua/shepherd-datalib.git@dev#subdirectory=shepherd_core -U```If you are working with ``.elf``-files (embedding into experiments) you make &quot;objcopy&quot; accessible to python. In Ubuntu, you can either install ``build-essential`` or ``binutils-$ARCH`` with arch being ``msp430`` or ``arm-none-eabi`` for the nRF52.```shell  sudo apt install build-essential```For more advanced work with ``.elf``-files (modify value of symbols / target-ID) you should install```shell  pip install shepherd-core[elf]```and also make sure the prereqs for the [pwntools](https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/install.html) are met.For creating an inventory of the host-system you should install```shell  pip install shepherd-core[inventory]```</longdescription>

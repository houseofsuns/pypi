	<longdescription>Djangorecipe: easy install of Django with buildout==================================================With djangorecipe you can manage your django site in a way that is familiar tobuildout users. For example:- ``bin/django`` to run django instead of ``bin/python manage.py``.- ``bin/test`` to run tests instead of ``bin/python manage.py test yourproject``.  (Including running coverage &quot;around&quot; your test).- ``bin/django`` automatically uses the right django settings. So you can have  a ``development.cfg`` buildout config and a ``production.cfg``, each telling  djangorecipe to use a different django settings module. ``bin/django`` will  use the right setting automatically, no need to set an environment variable.Djangorecipe is developed on github athttps://github.com/rvanlaar/djangorecipe, you can submit bug reports there. Itis tested with travis-ci and the code quality is checked via landscape.io:.. image:: https://secure.travis-ci.org/rvanlaar/djangorecipe.png?branch=master   :target: http://travis-ci.org/rvanlaar/djangorecipe/.. image:: https://landscape.io/github/rvanlaar/djangorecipe/master/landscape.svg?style=flat   :target: https://landscape.io/github/rvanlaar/djangorecipe/master   :alt: Code HealthSetup-----------You can see an example of how to use the recipe below with some of the mostcommon settings::    [buildout]    show-picked-versions = true    parts =        django    eggs =        yourproject        gunicorn    develop = .    # ^^^ Assumption: the current directory is where you develop 'yourproject'.    versions = versions    [versions]    Django = 1.8.2    gunicorn = 19.3.0    [django]    recipe = djangorecipe    settings = development    eggs = ${buildout:eggs}    project = yourproject    test = yourproject    scripts-with-settings = gunicorn    # ^^^ This line generates a bin/gunicorn-with-settings script with    # the correct django environment settings variable already set.Earlier versions of djangorecipe used to create a project structure for you,if you wanted it to. Django itself generates good project structures now. Justrun ``bin/django startproject &lt;projectname&gt;``. The main directory created isthe one where you should place your buildout and probably a ``setup.py``.Startproject creates a ``manage.py`` script for you. You can remove it, as the``bin/django`` script that djangorecipe creates is the (almost exact)replacement for it.See django's documentation for `startproject&lt;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/django-admin/#django-admin-startproject&gt;`_.You can also look at `cookiecutter &lt;https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/&gt;`_.Supported options-----------------The recipe supports the following options.project  This option sets the name for your project.settings  You can set the name of the settings file which is to be used with  this option. This is useful if you want to have a different  production setup from your development setup. It defaults to  `development`.test  If you want a script in the bin folder to run all the tests for a  specific set of apps this is the option you would use. Set this to  the list of app labels which you want to be tested. Normally, it is  recommended that you use this option and set it to your project's name.scripts-with-settings  Script names you add to here (like 'gunicorn') get a duplicate script  created with '-with-settings' after it (so:  ``bin/gunicorn-with-settings``). They get the settings environment variable  set. At the moment, it is mostly useful for gunicorn, which cannot be run  from within the django process anymore. So the script must already be passed  the correct settings environment variable.  **Note**: the package the script is in must be in the &quot;eggs&quot; option of your  part. So if you use gunicorn, add it there (or add it as a dependency of  your project).eggs  Like most buildout recipes, you can/must pass the eggs (=python packages)  you want to be available here. Often you'll have a list in the  ``[buildout]`` part and re-use it here by saying ``${buildout:eggs}``.coverage  If you set ``coverage = true``, ``bin/test`` will start coverage recording  before django starts. The ``coverage`` library must be importable. See the  extra coverage notes further below.The options below are for older projects or special cases mostly:dotted-settings-path  Use this option to specify a custom settings path to be used. By default,  the ``project`` and ``settings`` option values are concatenated, so for  instance ``myproject.development``. ``dotted-settings-path =  somewhere.else.production`` allows you to customize it.extra-paths  All paths specified here will be used to extend the default Python  path for the `bin/*` scripts. Use this if you have code somewhere without a  proper ``setup.py``.control-script  The name of the script created in the bin folder. This script is the  equivalent of the `manage.py` Django normally creates. By default it  uses the name of the section (the part between the `[ ]`). Traditionally,  the part is called ``[django]``.initialization  Specify some Python initialization code to be inserted into the  `control-script`. This functionality is very limited. In particular, be  aware that leading whitespace is stripped from the code given.wsgi  An extra script is generated in the bin folder when this is set to  `true`. This is mostly only useful when deploying with apache's  mod_wsgi. The name of the script is the same as the control script, but with  ``.wsgi`` appended. So often it will be ``bin/django.wsgi``.wsgi-script  Use this option if you need to overwrite the name of the script above.deploy_script_extra  In the `wsgi` deployment script, you sometimes need to wrap the application  in a custom wrapper for some cloud providers. This setting allows extra  content to be appended to the end of the wsgi script. For instance  ``application = some_extra_wrapper(application)``. The limits described  above for `initialization` also apply here.testrunner  This is the name of the testrunner which will be created. It  defaults to `test`.Coverage notes--------------Starting in django 1.7, you cannot use a custom test runner (like django-nose)anymore to automatically run your tests with coverage enabled. The new appinitialization mechanism already loads your ``models.py``, for instance,before the test runner gets called. So your ``models.py`` shows up as largelyuntested.With ``coverage = true``, ``bin/test`` starts coverage recording before djangogets called. It also prints out a report and export xml results (for recordingtest results in Jenkins, for instance) and html results.Behind the scenes, ``true`` is translated to a default of ``report xml_reporthtml_report``. These space-separated function names are called in turn on thecoverage instance. See the `coverage API docs&lt;http://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html&gt;`_ for the availablefunctions. If you only want a quick report and xml output, you can set``coverage = report xml_report`` instead.Note that you cannot pass options to these functions, like html outputlocation. For that, add a ``.coveragerc`` next to your ``buildout.cfg``. Seethe `coverage configuration file docs&lt;http://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html&gt;`_. Here is an example::    [run]    omit =        */migrations/*        *settings.py    source = your_app    [report]    show_missing = true    [html]    directory = htmlcov    [xml]    output = coverage.xmlExample configuration for mod_wsgi---------------------------------------------------If you want to deploy a project using mod_wsgi you could use thisexample as a starting point::    &lt;Directory /path/to/buildout&gt;         Order deny,allow         Allow from all    &lt;/Directory&gt;    &lt;VirtualHost 1.2.3.4:80&gt;         ServerName      my.rocking.server         CustomLog       /var/log/apache2/my.rocking.server/access.log combined         ErrorLog        /var/log/apache2/my.rocking.server/error.log         WSGIScriptAlias / /path/to/buildout/bin/django.wsgi    &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;Corner case: there is a problem when several wsgi scripts are combined in asingle virtual host instance of Apache. This is due to the fact that Djangouses the environment variable DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE. This variable gets setonce when the first wsgi script loads. The rest of the wsgi scripts will fail,because they need a different settings modules. However the environmentvariable DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE is only set once. The new `initialization`option that has been added to djangorecipe can be used to remedy this problemas shown below::    [django]    settings = acceptance    initialization =        import os        os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = '${django:project}.${django:settings}'Generating a control script for PyDev---------------------------------------------------Running Django with auto-reload in PyDev requires adding a small snippetof code::  import pydevd  pydevd.patch_django_autoreload(patch_remote_debugger=False, patch_show_console=True)just before the `if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:` in the `manage.py` module (or inthis case the control script, normally ``bin/django``, that is generated). Thefollowing example buildout generates two control scripts: one for command-lineusage and one for PyDev, with the required snippet, using the recipe's`initialization` option::    [buildout]    parts = django pydev    eggs =        mock    [django]    recipe = djangorecipe    eggs = ${buildout:eggs}    project = dummyshop    [pydev]    &lt;= django    initialization =        import pydevd        pydevd.patch_django_autoreload(patch_remote_debugger=False, patch_show_console=True)Example usage of django-configurations--------------------------------------django-configurations (http://django-configurations.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)is an application that helps you organize your Django settings into classes.Using it requires modifying the manage.py file.  This is done easily using therecipe's `initialization` option::    [buildout]    parts = django    eggs =        hashlib    [django]    recipe = djangorecipe    eggs = ${buildout:eggs}    project = myproject    initialization =        # Patch the manage file for django-configurations        import os        os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'myproject.settings')        os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_CONFIGURATION', 'Development')        from configurations.management import execute_from_command_line        import django        django.core.management.execute_from_command_line = execute_from_command_lineChanges=======2.2.1 (2016-06-29)------------------- Bugfix for 2.2: ``bin/test`` was missing quotes around an option. [reinout]2.2 (2016-06-29)----------------- Added optional ``coverage`` option. Set it to ``true`` to automatically run  coverage around your django tests. Needed if you used to have a test runner  like django-nose run your coverage automatically. Since django 1.7, this  doesn't work anymore. With the new &quot;coverage&quot; option, ``bin/test`` does it  for you. [reinout]- Automated tests (travis-ci.org) test with django 1.4, 1.8 and 1.9 now. And  pypi, python 2.7 and python 3.4. [reinout]2.1.2 (2015-10-21)------------------- Fixed documentation bug: the readme mentioned ``script-with-settings``  instead of ``scripts-with-settings`` (note the missing ``s`` after  ``script``). The correct one is ``script-with-settings``.  [tzicatl]2.1.1 (2015-06-15)------------------- Bugfix: ``script-entrypoints`` entry point finding now actually works.2.1 (2015-06-15)----------------- Renamed ``script-entrypoints`` option to ``scripts-with-settings``. It  accepts script names that would otherwise get generated (like ``gunicorn``)  and generates a duplicate script named like ``bin/gunicorn-with-settings``.  Technical note: this depends on the scripts being setuptools &quot;console_script  entrypoint&quot; scripts.2.0 (2015-06-10)----------------- Removed project generation. Previously, djangorecipe would generate a  directory for you from a template, but Django's own template is more than  good enough now. Especially: it generates a subdirectory for your project  now. Just run ``bin/django startproject &lt;projectname&gt;``.  See django's documentation for `startproject  &lt;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/django-admin/#django-admin-startproject&gt;`_.  You can also look at `cookiecutter &lt;https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/&gt;`_.  This also means the ``projectegg`` option is now deprecated, it isn't needed  anymore.- We aim at django 1.7 and 1.8 now. Django 1.4 still works, (except that that  one doesn't have a good startproject command).- Gunicorn doesn't come with the django manage.py integration, so ``bin/django  run_gunicorn`` doesn't work anymore. If you add ``script-entrypoints =  gunicorn`` to the configuration, we generate a ``bin/django_env_gunicorn``  script that is identical to ``bin/gunicorn``, only with the environment  correctly set.  **Note: renamed in 2.1 to ``scripts-with-settings``**.  This way, you can use the wsgi.py script in your project (copy it from the  django docs if needed) with ``bin/django_env_gunicorn yourproject/wsgi.py``  just like suggested everywhere. This way you can adjust your wsgi file to  your liking and run it with gunicorn.  For other wsgi runners (or programs you want to use with the correct  environment set), you can add a full entry point to ``script-entrypoints``,  like ``script-entrypoints = gunicorn=gunicorn.app.wsgiapp:run`` would be the  full line for gunicorn. Look up the correct entrypoint in the relevant  package's ``setup.py``.  Django's 1.8 ``wsgi.py`` file looks like this, see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/howto/deployment/wsgi/::      import os      from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application      os.environ.setdefault(&quot;DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE&quot;, &quot;yourproject.settings&quot;)      application = get_wsgi_application()- The ``wsgilog`` option has been deprecated, the old apache mod_wsgi script  hasn't been used for a long time.- Removed old pth option, previously used for pinax. Pinax uses proper python  packages since a long time, so it isn't needed anymore.1.11 (2014-11-21)------------------ The ``dotted-settings-path`` options was only used in management script. Now  it is also used for the generated wsgi file and the test scripts.1.10 (2014-06-16)------------------ Added ``dotted-settings-path`` option. Useful when you want to specify a  custom settings path to be used by the ``manage.main()`` command.- Renamed ``deploy_script_extra`` (with underscores) to  ``deploy-script-extra`` (with dashes) for consistency with the other  options. If the underscore version is found, an exception is raised.1.9 (2014-05-27)----------------- ``bin/test`` now passes along command line arguments to the underlying  management command. Previously, only the equivalent of ``manage.py test  list_of_apps`` would be done. Now command line arguments are passed as-is  after the list of apps.- Added ``deploy_script_extra`` option. It is appended to the wsgi script.  Useful for instance for a cloud hoster where you need to wrap your wsgi  application object in a custom call.1.8 (2014-05-27)----------------- Supporting buildout's relative-paths setting now.1.7 (2013-12-11)----------------- Add option to change the wsgi script name. Thanks hedleyroos (Fixes pull #74)1.6 (2013-10-28)----------------- Djangorecipe works with django 1.6 now.- Tested with Django 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6. Pre-1.4 support is gone, now. Also  tested on Python 2.6/2.7, 3.2/3.3.- Moved to buildout 2 support only.- Removed generation of fastcgi script. You can run it easily as ``bin/django  runfcgi`` and it will be deprecated in Django 1.7 anyway.1.5 (2013-01-25)----------------- Removed support for a different python version than the one you use to run  buildout with. Previously, you could run your buildout with 2.6 but get  Django to use 2.7 instead. zc.buildout 2.0 doesn't allow it anymore, so we  removed it too.1.4 (2013-01-15)----------------- Added initialization code support. Thanks to anshumanb, jjmurre. (Closes #58).1.3 (2012-09-07)----------------- Removed deprecation warning in Django 1.4. Fixes #49, thanks Shagi.- Added documentation for use with mr.developer. Thanks shagi (closes issue #45)- Added Travis support.1.2.1 (2012-05-15)------------------- Fixed broken 1.2 release (missing ``*.rst`` files due to a recent txt-to-rst  rename action).1.2 (2012-05-14)----------------- Removed location path from recipe. Thanks bleskes (fixes issue #50).1.1.2------ Added correct url to the deprecation warning1.1.1------ Fixed Python3 Trove classifiers1.1---- Support python3.- Changed buildout and the tests to run the tests under nose.- Removed some old pre 0.99 unittests that dealt with download support.1.0---- Stable release with a real 1.0 version.- Made djangorecipe more pep08 compliant.0.99----- Djangorecipe now depends on Django. The use of the `version =` statement  is deprecated. Specify the django version in the  `[versions]` section. Install django via mr.developer if you need to use  an svn/git/hg repository. For other uses  Versionpin djangorecipe to 0.23.1 if you don't want to upgrade.  Thanks to Reinout van Rees for help with this release.- Removed subversion and download support.0.23.1------- Added a missing 'import os'0.23----- Support for settings/urls boilerplate for django 1.2 and django 1.3.  It defaults to 1.3 when the version isn't 1.2.0.22----- Added support for svn urls with spaces. Thanks to Brad103 (fixes #537718).- Updated code and buildout to use newest zc.recipe.egg,  zc.recipe.testrunner and python-dateutil.0.21----- The admin url is now configured for django 1.1 or higher. Thanks to  Sam Charrington (fixes #672220).- Bootstrap.py updated (fixes #501954).0.20----- The recipe know makes the `django` package know to setuptools during install.  This closes #397864. Thanks to Daniel Bruce and Dan Fairs for the patch.- Fixed #451065 which fixes a problem with the WSGI log file option.- Added the posibilty to configure more FCGI related settings. Thanks to Vasily  Sulatskov for the patch.0.19.2------- The generated WSGI &amp; FCGI scripts are now properly removed when  options change (fixes #328182). Thanks to Horst Gutmann for the  patch.- Scripts are now updated when dependencies change. This fixes #44658,  thanks to Paul Carduner for the patch.0.19.1------- Applied fix for the change in WSGI script generation. The previous  release did not work properly.0.19----- When running again with non-newest set the recipe will no longer  update the Subversion checkout. Thanks to vinilios for the patch.- The WSGI and FCGI scripts are now generated using Buildout's own  system. This makes them more similar to the generated manage script  with regard to the setup of paths. Thanks to Jannis Leidel for the  patch.0.18----- Paths from eggs and extra-paths now get precedence over the default  system path (fixes #370420). Thanks to Horst Gutmann for the patch.- The generated WSGI script now uses the `python` option if  present. This fixes #361695.0.17.4------- Fixed a problem when not running in verbose mode (fixes #375151).0.17.3------- Removed dependency on setuptools_bzr since it does not seem to work  like I expected.0.17.2------- Changed the download code to use urllib2. This should make it work  from behind proxies (fixes #362822). Thanks to pauld for the patch.0.17.1------- Fixed a problem with the new WSGI logging option #348797. Thanks to  Bertrand Mathieu for the patch.- Disable generation of the WSGI log if &quot;wsgilog&quot; isn't set, thanks to  Jacob Kaplan-Moss for the patch.- Updated buildout.cfg and .bzrignore, thanks Jacob Kaplan-Moss.0.17----- Added an option to specify a log file for output redirection from  the WSGI script. Thanks to Guido Wesdorp for the patch.0.16----- Subversion aliases are now supported (something like  svn+mystuff://myjunk). Thanks to Remco for the patch.0.15.2------- Update to move pth-files finder from the __init__ method to the  install method so it runs in buildout-order, else it looks for pth  files in dirs that may not yet exist. Thanks to Chris Shenton for  the update to his original patch.0.15.1------- Update to make the previously added pth-files option better  documented.0.15----- Added &quot;pth-files&quot; option to add libraries to extra-paths from  site .pth files. Thanks to Chris Shenton for the patch.0.14----- The recipe now supports creating a FCGI script. Thanks to Jannis  Leidel for the patch.- When downloading a Django recipe for the first time the recipe now  properly reports the url it is downloading from.0.13----- Specifying a user name within a subversion url now works. The code  that determined the revision has been updated. This fixes issue  #274004. Thanks to Remco for the patch.- Updated the template for creating new projects. It now uses the  current admin system when generating it's `urls.py` file. This fixes  issue #276255. Thanks to Roland for the patch.0.12.1------- Re-upload since CHANGES.txt was missing from the release0.12----- The recipe no longer executes subversion to determine whether the  versions is to be downloaded using subversion. This fixes issue  #271145. Thanks to Kapil Thangavelu for the patch.- Changed the `pythonpath` option to `extra-paths`. This makes the  recipe more consistent with other recipes (see issue #270908).0.11----- Another go at fixing the updating problem (#250811) by making sure  the update method is always called. It would not be called in the  previous version since the recipe wrote a random secret (if it  wasn't specified) to the options for use with a template. Buildout  saw this as a change in options and therefore always decided to  un-install &amp; install.- When both projectegg and wsgi=True are specified, the generated wsgi  file did not have the correct settings file in it. This has been  fixed with a patch from Dan Fairs.- The recipe now has logging. All print statements have been replaced  and a few extra logging calls have been added. This makes the recipe  more informative about long running tasks. Thanks erny for the patch  from issue #260628.0.10----- The recipe no longer expects the top level directory name in a  release tarball to be consistent with the version number. This fixes  issue #260097. Thanks to erny for reporting this issue and  suggesting a solution.- Revision pinns for the svn checkout now stay pinned when re-running  the buildout. This fixes issue #250811. Thanks to Remco for  reporting this.- Added an option to specify an egg to use as the project. This  disables the code which creates the basic project structure. Thanks  to Dan Fairs for the patch from issue #252647.0.9.1------ Fixed the previous release which was broken due to a missing  manifest file0.9---- The settings option is fixed so that it supports arbitrary depth  settings paths (example; `conf.customer.development`).- The version argument now excepts a full svn url as well. You can use  this to get a branch or fix any url to a specific revision with the  standard svn @ syntax- The wsgi script is no longer made executable and readable only by  the user who ran buildout. This avoids problems with deployment.</longdescription>

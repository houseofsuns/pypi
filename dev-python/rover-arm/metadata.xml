To install in dev version you could do```pip install 'rover-arm[dev]'```Keyboard ControlsRoverUp, Down, Left, Right Arrows to steer the Rover.  ArmA, D -&gt; Move the end-effector in X-axisW, S -&gt; Move the end-effector in Y-axisQ, E -&gt; Move the end-effector in Z-axis-, + -&gt; Open / Close the fingers of the robot armNote: W, S are also hot keys to adjust view in pybullet env (so ignore the changes or press again to undo the change.)Code to control the bot using keyboard in human mode (needs to be run in local)```import rover_arm.keyboard_control as kcimport rover_armimport gymenv = gym.make('rover-arm-pick-v0', render_mode = 'human')keyboard_controller = kc.KeyboardAction()keyboard_controller.start_listening()observation = env.reset()done = Falsewhile not done:    action = keyboard_controller.action    observation, reward, done, info = env.step(action)    # print(action, observation, reward)# print(reward, done, info)```Task2: Pick the object from the closer tray and place it on the distant tray Use the env &quot;rover-arm-place-v0&quot; for task2```env = gym.make('rover-arm-place-v0')```</longdescription>

	<longdescription># Easy REPLA simple python class for creating Read Evaluate Print Line (REPL) interfaces.## RequirementsThis module requires Python 3.7 or higher. Additionally this library makes use of the [GNU readline Interface](https://docs.python.org/3/library/readline.html), so it will only work on Unix based systems.## UsageThis module exposes the `REPL` class which can be used to quickly create a REPL interface. REPL will read in a line of user input via a custom input function that allows you to edit the text by moving the cursor with the arrow keys, as well as view the history of previous inputs.```pythonfrom easyrepl import REPLfor line in REPL():    # do something with line    print(line)```which will create a simple echoing REPL interface that repeats any line you type into it.```bash&gt;&gt;&gt; hellohello&gt;&gt;&gt; worldworld&gt;&gt;&gt;```The input allows common terminal shortcuts like:- **Ctrl-D**: exit REPL- **Ctrl-L**: clear screen- **Ctrl-R**: search history- **Left/Right Arrow**: move cursor left/right- **Up/Down Arrow**: previous/next history- **Ctrl-A**: move cursor to beginning of line- **Ctrl-E**: move cursor to end of line- **Alt-B**: move cursor backward one word- **Alt-F**: move cursor forward one word- **Ctrl-K**: delete from cursor to end of line- **Ctrl-U**: delete from cursor to beginning of line- **Ctrl-W**: delete from cursor to beginning of word- **Alt-D**: delete from cursor to end of word- **Ctrl-C**: no operation- etc.Additionally, multi-line input can be achieved by starting a line with triple quotes (`&quot;&quot;&quot;` or `'''`), and ending the final line with a matching triple quote. Triple quotes in the middle of a line will have no effect.```&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;... This is a multi-line input... that will continue until... the user enters three quotes... at the end of a line... &quot;&quot;&quot;This is a multi-line inputthat will continue untilthe user enters three quotesat the end of a line&gt;&gt;&gt;```Note that a single newline will be stripped from the beginning and end of the input if present.</longdescription>

This is done with a hidden metadata added to the comment so it could be detected in a subsequent run, and update or hide previous messages if needed.## Basic usageCreate a Github token with `repo` scope and export it as `PR_COMMENTER_GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable```pr-commenter your/repo 12 comment.txt```Or from the standard input, using `-` as the file name```cat comment.txt | pr-commenter your/repo 12 -```This will simply create a new comment in the PR 12 with the content of `comment.txt`But there is much more. ## Advanced exampleSuposse you have a template `failed_tests.j2` like this```jinja2{% if not is_append %}## Failed tests{% endif %} [suite {{ CI_SUITE_NAME }}]({{ CI_SUITE_URL }}):```bash{% for line in input_lines %}{{ line }}{% endfor %}```Then your test-runner produces a file `failures.txt`  with the list of failed tests like this:```tests/test_client.py::test_client_simpletests/test_client.py::test_client_complex```So we want to add a **single comment** to the PR with the failed tests for two different suites executions triggered by the same &quot;commit&quot;. In the post-build phase of both suites, you can run something like ```bashpr-commenter your/repo $PR failures.txt -t failed_tests.j2 --build=$COMMIT```The first suite that finish will post a comment like this````markdown&lt;!-- pr-commenter: failed_tests.j2 abc123 --&gt;## Failed tests [suite client](http://the-client-url):```bashtests/test_client.py::test_client_simpletests/test_client.py::test_client_complex```````Then the second suite will find that previous comment that was for the same template and same and commit (`&quot;abc123&quot;` in the example), so pr-commenter willedit the comment and append the new content. The result will be something like this:````markdown&lt;!-- pr-commenter: failed_tests.j2 abc123 --&gt;## Failed tests [suite client](http://the-client-url):```bashtests/test_client.py::test_client_simpletests/test_client.py::test_client_complex```[suite server](http://the-server-url):```bashtests/test_server.py::test_server_1```````In a next commit, the first suite that finishes will post a new comment, but this time the commit will be different, so the previous &quot;abc123&quot; comment will be minimized. ## TemplatesIt uses Jinja2 templates. The stdin/files is passed and a variable `input_lines`And `is_append` will be `True` in case the new comment will be appended to an existentone (so you can ommit the header or footer, for instance). In addition, the complete `os.environ` dictionary is passed, so all the environment variables are available in the template.## Install- Install the package with pipx```pip install --user pipxpipx install pr-commenter```Alternatively, with pip```pip install --user pr-commenter```- Create a Github token with `repo` scope and export it as `PR_COMMENTER_GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable</longdescription>

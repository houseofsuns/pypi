Python 3.9 DOES have a wheel file for confluent-kafka so that's your safest bet. ## API[Sphinx Docs](https://jeffersonlab.github.io/jaws-libp/)## BuildThis [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/) project is built with [setuptools](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/setuptools.html) and may be run using the Python [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) feature to isolate dependencies.   The [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) tool can be used to download dependencies.```git clone https://github.com/JeffersonLab/jaws-libpcd jaws-libppython -m build```**Note for JLab On-Site Users**: Jefferson Lab has an intercepting [proxy](https://gist.github.com/slominskir/92c25a033db93a90184a5994e71d0b78)**See**: [Python Development Notes](https://gist.github.com/slominskir/e7ed71317ea24fc19b97a0ec006ff4f1)## Release1. Bump the version number in setup.cfg and commit and push to GitHub (using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)).   1. Create a new release on the GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/jaws-libp/releases) page corresponding to same version in setup.cfg (Enumerate changes and link issues)1. Clean build by removing `build`, `dist`, and `docsrc/source/_autosummary` directories1. Activate [virtual env](https://gist.github.com/slominskir/e7ed71317ea24fc19b97a0ec006ff4f1#activate-dev-virtual-environment)1. From venv build package, build docs, lint, test, and publish new artifact to PyPi with:```python -m buildsphinx-build -b html docsrc/source build/docspylint src/jaws_libppytestpython -m twine upload --repository pypi dist/*```4. Update Sphinx docs by copying them from build dir into gh-pages branch and updating index.html (commit, push).## See Also - [jaws-libj (Java)](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/jaws-libj) - [Developer Notes](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/jaws-libp/wiki/Developer-Notes)</longdescription>

Binary installers for the latest released version are available at the [PythonPackage Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/divina)```shpip install divina```## Dependencies- [dask - Adds support for arbitrarily large datasets via remote, parallelized compute](https://www.dask.org)- [dask-ml - Provides distributed-optimized implementations of many popular models](https://ml.dask.org)- [s3fs - Allows for easy and efficient access to S3](https://github.com/dask/s3fs)- [pyarrow - Enables persistence of datasets as storage and compute efficent parquet files](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/)- [prefect - Enables task orchestration, tracking and persistence](https://prefect.io)## TestingFor local integration testing, run the following commands in order to create the necessary Prefect and Min.io containers.```shdocker pull jhurdle/divina-storagedocker pull jhurdle/divina-prefectdocker run -p 9000:9000 jhurdle/divina-storage docker run -p 4200:4200 jhurdle/divina-prefect pytest divina/divina/tests```## License[AGPL](LICENSE)## BackgroundWork on ``divina`` started at [Coysu Consulting](https://www.coysu.com/) (a technology consulting firm) in 2020 andhas been under active development since then.## Getting HelpFor usage questions, the best place to go to is [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/divina).## Discussion and DevelopmentMost development discussions take place on GitHub in this repo.## Contributing to divina All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas are welcome.If you are simply looking to start working with the divina codebase, navigate to the [GitHub &quot;issues&quot; tab](https://github.com/secrettoad/divina/issues) and start looking through interesting issues.</longdescription>

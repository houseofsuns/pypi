The segmentation results are uploaded as napari layers into the viewer automatically with the name structure of *imgename_prediction*.## Installation1. Please install either GPU or CPU version of tensorflow that is compatible with your `cuda` and `cudnn` libraries before installing the plugin depending on your system.One of the plugin dependency is `yapic` that currently has sensitivity to tensorflow versions.2. You can install `napari-yapic-prediction` via [pip]:    ```pip install napari-yapic-prediction```## ContributingContributions are very welcome.

This behaviour may change in the future as more and more diverse management systems... code-block:: python  from base import MgmtSystemAPIBase  class RHEVMSystem(MgmtSystemAPIBase):      _stats_available = {      'num_vm': lambda self: self.api.get_summary().get_vms().total,      'num_host': lambda self: len(self.list_host()),      'num_cluster': lambda self: len(self.list_cluster()),      'num_template': lambda self: len(self.list_template()),      'num_datastore': lambda self: len(self.list_datastore()),    }      def __init__(self, hostname, username, password, **kwargs):      super(RHEVMSystem, self).__init__(kwargs)The call to ``super`` is necessary to set up the logger if noe has not been passed in with the ``logger``keyword.The developer can then add their own methods to interact with their own management system. Commonly accessiblestatistics are generally all named the same across management systems. In this way we can treat multiple managementsystems the same and use an identical method to check the number of vms on a RHEV system, to a VMware system.Exceptions currently sit in a single module, this will probably change later with each management system having it's ownpackage and exceptions stored there.This module was originally developed for assisting in the ManageIQ testing team.Contributing------------The guidelines to follow for this project can be found in the cfme `dev_guide &lt;http://cfme-tests.readthedocs.org/guides/dev_guide.html&gt;`_.</longdescription>

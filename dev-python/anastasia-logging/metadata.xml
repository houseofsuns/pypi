About *logging* Python Library** ##This repository is based in python base log management library called [logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html).Commonly, when this library is intended to be used, for a basic usage a simple logging import is recommended to be used in order to avoid additional settings in our internal scripts.```import logginglogging.warning(&quot;I am a very usefull warning&quot;)OUTPUT =&gt; WARNING:root:I am a very usefull warning```But, for more complex repositories, is recommended to manage different loggers according to their necessities. For a customized logging behaviour, a Logger class must be declared from logging.```import logginglogger = logging.Logger(&quot;custom_logger&quot;)logger.warning(&quot;I am a very usefull warning&quot;)OUTPUT =&gt; I am a very usefull warning```Have you noticed in the first import logging example that appears the word *root* in the output console? This is because when you use ```import logging``` directly, a default Logger class is instanciated with name *root* along with default configurations.This repository contains a class called **AnastasiaLogger**, which inherits from Logger class and standarize logging definitions and has some improvments over debugging (```.debug()```), information (```.info()```), warning (```.warning()```), error (```.error()```), critical (```.critical()```) and fatal (```.fatal()```) methods.```from anastasia_logging import AnastasiaLoggerlogger = AnastasiaLogger()logger.warning(&quot;I am a very usefull warning&quot;)OUTPUT =&gt; 2023-05-08 10:39:17 UTC/GMT-0400 | [ANASTASIA-JOB] WARNING: I am a very usefull warning```If a script already has a logging usage, it is possible to replace ```import logging``` with ```import anastasia_logging as logging``` and no modifications are required from the script side to work!```import anastasia_logging as logginglogging.warning(&quot;I am a very usefull warning&quot;)OUTPUT =&gt; 2023-05-08 10:39:17 UTC/GMT-0400 | [ANASTASIA-JOB] WARNING: I am a very usefull warning```## **2. Enhancements and Additional Functionalities** ##### **2.1 Log Output Standarization** ###AnastasiaLogger has a common structure in order to show information, which is the following one:```YYYY-MM-DD HR:MN:SS UTC/GMT(+-)HHMN | [TAG] LEVEL: message```TAG is define by default as ANASTASIA-JOB (can be changed during class instantiation), and LEVEL is defined according to level method called.TAG is intended to differentiate responsabilities along scripts in other repositories.### **2.2 Predefined Parameters for AnastasiaLoggers from Environment Variables** ###For a faster logging behaviour along an entire repository, some variables that AnastasiaLogger can recieve can be predefined as environment variables, which are:* ```ANASTASIA_LOG_NAME```: name identification of logger instance (default=```&quot;anastasia-log&quot;```)* ```ANASTASIA_LOG_TAG```: tag identification for job type for StreamHandlers (console) and FileHandlers (file) (default=```&quot;ANASTASIA-JOB&quot;```)* ```ANASTASIA_LOG_LEVEL```: define severity hierarchy for log generation (default=```&quot;INFO&quot;```)* ```ANASTASIA_LOG_SAVELOG```: generate ```.log``` file containing logs generated (default=```&quot;0&quot;``` (deactivated))* ```ANASTASIA_LOG_PATH```: define a custom name for log file (default=```&quot;anastasia-log.log&quot;```)If it is not the case, AnastasiaLogger will instanciate with default parameters.### **2.3 Code Tags Standarization** ###In order to have a common identification for upper level implementations, AnastasiaLogger holds a standarized code implementations according to different topics.The coding structure is the following one:| **Code** |         **Topic**      ||:---------:|:-------------------------:||     0    |       Unindentified       ||    1XX   |       Data related      ||    2XX   |   Mathematical related    ||    3XX   |        AI related         ||    4XX   |     Resources related ||    5XX   | Operative System related ||    6XX   |       API related         ||    7XX   |       AWS related         |Methods ```debug()```, ```info()```, ```warning()```, ```error()```, ```critical()``` and ```fatal()``` can be declared with a code as parameter in order to extended log with a code description.```import anastasia_logging as logginglogging.warning(&quot;I am a dataset warning&quot;, 100)OUTPUT =&gt; 2023-05-08 11:55:27 UTC/GMT-0400 | [ANASTASIA-JOB] WARNING: &lt;W100&gt; I am a dataset warning```If a code is already predefined and no message is introduced, a default message will appear according to code declared.### **2.4 Print Functionality** ###For a easy visualization in console without interacting with an AnastasiaLogger, you can use ```print``` like a python built-in print call.```import anastasia_logging as logginglogging.print(&quot;Some prints to show&quot;)OUTPUT =&gt; 2023-05-08 11:55:27 UTC/GMT-0400 | [ANASTASIA-JOB] PRINT: Some prints to show```## **3. Versioning** ##### v1.3.4 ###* Fixes:    * Fixed edge cases in ```ANASTASIA_LOG_LEVEL``` and ```ANASTASIA_LOG_PATH``` assiganation values### v1.3.3 ###* Fixes:    * Fixed edge case of ```ANASTASIA_LOG_SAVELOG``` environment variable detection if value entered is not a digit### v1.3.2 ###* Fixes:    * Fixed parameter assignation for ```ANASTASIA_LOG_SAVELOG``` environment variable### v1.3.1 ###* Fixes:    * Default unindentified ```debug```, ```critical``` and ```fatal``` standard codes fixed### v1.3.0 ###* Features:    * Functions ```critical```, ```fatal``` and ```debug``` incorporated### v1.2.0 ###* Features:    * Function ```print``` incorporated    * Functions ```info```, ```warning```, ```error``` and ```print``` can return the formatted message for further usage### v1.1.1 ###* Fixes:    * Function ```basicConfig``` was skipping predefined structures with tags and log streamhandlers### v1.1.0 ###* Features:    * Function ```basicConfig``` equivalent from logging implemented for root AnastasiaLogger### v1.0.0 ###* Features:    * ```AnastasiaLogger``` Class abstraction    * Standar code description definitions for ```INFO```, ```WARNING``` and ```ERROR```    * Predefined ```AnastasiaLogger``` parameters loaded from environment variables</longdescription>

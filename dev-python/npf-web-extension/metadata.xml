	<longdescription># Network Performance Framework Web ExtensionThis repository is an extension to NPF (&lt;https://github.com/tbarbette/npf&gt;). The architecture has been built based on npf's internal architecture. It should be used along as part of npf's workflow.It can also be used as a standalone tool. It is recommended to install the python package via `pip install npf-web-extension`.For more advanced usage, the app can be built using the commands available below and then opening the `template.html` file inside a browser. After opening the file, the following command can be run inside the browser to display a configuration.```jswindow.updateConfiguration(configurationData);```the signature of the `updateConfiguration` method is available inside the `App.tsx` file.## Available Scripts### `npm start`Runs the app in development mode available at address `http://localhost:3000`### `npm run test`Runs the test suite covering all methods used by the app### `npm run coverage`Runs the test suite covering all methods used by the app### `npm run build`Builds the app for production and optimizes it.### `npm run deploy`Builds the app for production, optimizes it then prepares it for deployment.## Releases- V0.6.4  - Complete rewriting of the internal architecture  - Added download button to download chart as pdf  - Added infobox when toggling fullscreen  - Fixed pie charts not resizing properly  - Fixed graphs not being splitted properly  - Improved rendering performance.

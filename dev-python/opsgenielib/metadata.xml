	<longdescription>===========opsgenielib===========A python library for Opsgenie* Documentation: https://opsgenielib.readthedocs.org/en/latestDevelopment Workflow====================The workflow supports the following steps * lint * test * build * document * upload * graphThese actions are supported out of the box by the corresponding scripts under _CI/scripts directory with sane defaults based on best practices.Sourcing setup_aliases.ps1 for windows powershell or setup_aliases.sh in bash on Mac or Linux will provide with handy aliases for the shell of all those commands prepended with an underscore.The bootstrap script creates a .venv directory inside the project directory hosting the virtual environment. It uses pipenv for that.It is called by all other scripts before they do anything. So one could simple start by calling _lint and that would set up everything before it tried to actually lint the projectOnce the code is ready to be delivered the _tag script should be called accepting one of three arguments, patch, minor, major following the semantic versioning scheme.So for the initial delivery one would call    $ _tag --minorwhich would bump the version of the project to 0.1.0 tag it in git and do a push and also ask for the change and automagically update HISTORY.rst with the version and the change provided.So the full workflow after git is initialized is: * repeat as necessary (of course it could be test - code - lint :) )   * code   * lint   * test * commit and push * develop more through the code-lint-test cycle * tag (with the appropriate argument) * build * upload (if you want to host your package in pypi) * document (of course this could be run at any point)Important Information=====================This template is based on pipenv. In order to be compatible with requirements.txt so the actual created package can be used by any part of the existing python ecosystem some hacks were needed.So when building a package out of this **do not** simple call    $ python setup.py sdist bdist_egg**as this will produce an unusable artifact with files missing.**Instead use the provided build and upload scripts that create all the necessary files in the artifact.Project Features================* TODOHistory-------0.0.1 (12-04-2019)---------------------* First code creation0.0.11 (28-05-2019)-------------------* removal of .json on set_maintenance_policy0.0.12 (28-05-2019)-------------------* added functions0.0.13 (28-05-2019)-------------------* maintenance policies - list functions - are now teambased0.0.14 (28-05-2019)-------------------* added function: count_alerts_by_query0.0.15 (10-06-2019)-------------------* 'added functionality: adding more than 1 policy to a set_maintenance_policy'0.0.16 (10-06-2019)-------------------* refactoring0.0.17 (11-06-2019)-------------------* 2nd try on adding multiple arguments for set_maintenance_policy0.0.18 (09-08-2019)-------------------* function names with more explicit names + reusing url endpoints to make the code more dry0.0.19 (09-08-2019)-------------------* Adding the functionality to enable and disable alert/notification policies0.0.20 (16-08-2019)-------------------* cancel_maintenance_policy now supports multiple ID's0.0.21 (17-08-2019)-------------------* Allowing the input of multiple ID's for delete_maintenance_policy0.0.22 (18-08-2019)-------------------* Adding multiple arguments for: disable/enable/delete notification- &amp; alert policy0.0.23 (20-08-2019)-------------------* Small fixes regarding the loops in multiple functions0.0.24 (07-09-2019)-------------------* Added the function: list_schedule_timeline_by_team_name0.0.25 (02-10-2019)-------------------* Adding users endpoint and the function list users0.0.26 (03-10-2019)-------------------* Added function close_alerts0.0.27 (09-10-2019)-------------------* Removed the team-id from list_maintenance_policy and renamed the function name0.0.28 (11-10-2019)-------------------* Added pagination for query_alerts0.0.29 (29-11-2019)-------------------* Class name changed from OpsGenie to Opsgenie and the functions with maintenance_policy were renamed to maintenance so removing the policy part.0.0.30 (04-01-2020)-------------------* Added function create_alert_policy0.0.31 (19-06-2020)-------------------* Adding more parameters to the function: list_schedule_timeline_by_team_name0.0.32 (23-06-2020)-------------------* Return empty array when response.json()['data'] is empty0.0.33 (26-06-2020)-------------------* Better way of limiting results of query_alerts to 2000 results maximum0.0.34 (29-06-2020)-------------------* added limit param to the query_alerts method0.0.35 (12-10-2020)-------------------* Cleaning up0.0.36 (21-03-2023)-------------------* Using the existing dataclasses more in the output for teams0.0.37 (22-03-2023)-------------------* Created Alert policy class and modified the other functions to use that class0.0.38 (22-03-2023)-------------------* Added functions: get_alert_policy_by_name &amp; set_maintenance_hours_by_name0.0.39 (02-04-2023)-------------------* Modeling MaintenancePolicy0.0.40 (09-04-2023)-------------------* Returning maintenancepolicy object instead of json and finding a alert policy is now case insensitive0.0.41 (09-04-2023)-------------------* fixing a bug in cancel_maintenance0.0.42 (15-08-2023)-------------------* Adding: heartbeat, team, user profile/notification functions0.0.43 (15-11-2023)-------------------* AlertPolicy filter was not parsed correctly</longdescription>

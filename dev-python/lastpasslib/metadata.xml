	<longdescription>===========lastpasslib===========A library able to retrieve and decrypt all items in lastpass along with their change history and attachments.* Documentation: https://lastpasslib.readthedocs.org/en/latestProject Features================* Can completely decrypt all secrets, attachments, and all history of every field that supports it.* Can save the blob locally.* Can save attachments of secrets.* Exposes share info to and from people.Project Inspiration===================Initial inspiration was taken from https://github.com/konomae/lastpass-python. More features were needed and I could notreally follow the design of that project so well, so I ended up rewriting all of it with a new design that made sense tome and implemented all the required features on that. This project is now quite further that the original project feature wise.During my reverse engineering efforts I also found https://github.com/cfbao/lastpass-vault-parser/blob/master/lastpass-vault-format.mdsadly a little too late. Also extended my model further than the documentation of that project.History-------0.0.1 (08-02-2023)---------------------* First code creation0.1.0 (11-02-2023)------------------* Initial release0.2.0 (17-02-2023)------------------* Implement retrieving secrets by group and shared folder.0.3.0 (17-02-2023)------------------* Implement friendly interface to retrieve passwords and secure notes by group and shared folder.0.4.0 (19-02-2023)------------------* Implement folder grouping and retrieval.0.5.0 (24-02-2023)------------------* Implement folder filtering out on secret parsing.0.6.0 (24-02-2023)------------------* Implement a consistent interface for update datetime reporting.0.7.0 (01-03-2023)------------------* Implement root folder, personal folders and shared folders.

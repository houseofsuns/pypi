It mostly focuses on- Staying up-to-date with information Bandcamp provide in the JSON metadata- Parsing **all possible** (if relevant) metadata from various places  - For example, a catalog number given in the release or media description- Correctness of the data  - For example, determining artist names from various artists releases- Compliance with MusicBrainz fields format, to remove the need for pre-processing if, for  example, one wishes to upload the metadata to MB.Thanks to [unrblt] for [beets-bandcamp] providing the idea and initial implementation.[beets]: https://github.com/beetbox/beets[unrblt]: https://github.com/unrblt[beets-bandcamp]: https://github.com/unrblt/beets-bandcamp# Installation## Recommended method1. Install `beets` with `pipx` so that it's isolated from your system and other projects```bashpipx install beets```2. Inject `beetcamp` and other dependencies that you need```bashpipx inject beets beetcamp [python-mpd2 ...]```3. Add `bandcamp` to the `plugins` list to your beets configuration file.## OtherwiseNavigate to your `beets` virtual environment and install the plug-in with```bash   pip install beetcamp```# CLIThe plugin exposes some of its functionality through a command-line application `beetcamp`:```xmlusage: beetcamp [-h] [-a] [-l] [-t] [release_url | query]Get bandcamp release metadata from the given &lt;release-url&gt; or performbandcamp search with &lt;query&gt;. Anything that does not start with https://will be assumed to be a query. Search type flags: -a for albums, -l forlabels and artists, -t for tracks. By default, all types are searched.positional arguments:  release_url  Release URL, starting with https:// OR  query        Search queryoptions:  -h, --help   show this help message and exit  -a, --album  Search albums  -l, --label  Search labels and artists  -t, --track  Search tracks  -o INDEX, --open INDEX                        Open search result indexed by INDEX in the browser```- Use `beetcamp &lt;bandcamp-release-url&gt;` to return release metadata in JSON format.- Use `beetcamp [-alt] &lt;query&gt;` to search albums, labels and tracks on Bandcamp and return  results in JSON. - Search results are indexed - add `-o &lt;index&gt;` in order to open the chosen URL in the browser.You can see how the data looks below (the output is prettified with [rich-tables]).![image](https://github.com/snejus/beetcamp/blob/fe6ea71a0ab0035d657d13f664de957befb4552c/images/search.png?raw=true)[rich-tables]: https://github.com/snejus/rich-tables# Configuration## Default```yamlbandcamp:  include_digital_only_tracks: true  search_max: 2  art: yes  comments_separator: &quot;\n---\n&quot;  exclude_extra_fields: []  genre:    capitalize: no    maximum: 0    always_include: []    mode: progressive # classical, progressive or psychedelic```---#### `include_digital_only_tracks`- Type: **bool**- Default: `true`For media that isn't `Digital Media`, include all tracks, even if their titles contain**digital only** (or alike).If you have `False` here, then, for example, a `Vinyl` media of an album will only includethe tracks that are supposed to be found in that media.---#### `search_max`- Type: **int**- Default: `2`.Number of items to fetch through search, maximum is 18. Usually, a matching release shouldbe found among the first two items.---#### `art`- Type: **bool**- Default: `false`.Add a source to the[FetchArt](http://beets.readthedocs.org/en/latest/plugins/fetchart.html) plug-in todownload album art for Bandcamp albums (requires `FetchArt` plug-in enabled).---#### `comments_separator`- Type: **string**- Default: `&quot;\n---\n&quot;`.The separator that divides release, media descriptions and credits within the `comments`field. By default you would get    Description    ---    Media description    ---    Credits#### `exclude_extra_fields`- Type: **list**- Default: _`empty`_List of fields that you _do not_ want to see in the metadata. For example, if you find theinclusion of `comments` irrelevant and are not interested in lyrics, you could specify```yamlbandcamp:  search_max: 5  exclude_extra_fields:    - lyrics    - comments```and the plugin will skip them.You cannot exclude `album`, `album_id`, `artist_id`, `media` and `data_url` album fields.---#### `genre` (new since 0.11.0)- Type: **object**- Default:  ```yaml  genre:    capitalize: no    maximum: 0 # no maximum    mode: progressive    always_include: []  ```**genre.capitalize**: **Classical, Techno** instead of default **classical, techno**.For consistency, this option also applies to the `style` field.**genre.maximum** caps the maximum number of included genres. This may be ofvalue in those cases where artists/labels begin the list with the most relevant keywords,however be aware it is rarely the case.**genre.mode** accepts one of the following options: **classical** (less genres) or **progressive** or**psychedelic** (more genres). Each later one is more flexible regarding what is a validgenre and what is not. See below (we use the list of [musicbrainz genres] for reference).**genre.always_include**: genre patterns that override the mode and always matchsuccessfully. For example, if you want to bypass checks for every keyword that ends with`core`, you could specify```yamlgenre:  always_include:    - &quot;core$&quot;```##### `genre` modesWe can place all keywords into the following buckets:| type  |                                      |                                                                      || :---: | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- || **1** | **`genre`**                          | a valid single-word musicbrainz genre                                || **1** | **`more specific genre`**            | a valid musicbrainz genre made of multiple words                     || **2** | **`somegenre`** **`someothergenre`** | each of the words is a valid musicbrainz genre, but the combo is not || **3** | very specific **`genre`**            | not all words are valid genres, but the very last one is             || **4** | maybe **`genre`** but                | but it is followed by noise at the end                               || **4** | some sort of location                | irrelevant                                                           |- **classical** mode strictly follows the musicbrainz list of genres, therefore it covers  **type 1** only- **progressive** mode, in addition to the above, takes into account each of the words that  make up the keyword and will be fine as long as each of those words maps to some sort of  genre from the musicbrainz list. It covers **types 1 and 2**.- **psychedelic** (or **noise**) mode, in addition to the above, treats the keyword as a  valid genre as long as **the last word** in it maps to some genre - covering **types 1 to 3**.  This one should include the hottest genre naming trends but is also liable to covering the  latest `&lt;some-label&gt;-&lt;genre&gt;` or `&lt;some-city&gt;-&lt;some-very-generic-genre&gt;` trends which may  not be ideal. It should though be the best option for those who enjoy detailed, fine-grained  stats.- **type 4** is ignored in each case (can be overridden and included through the `genre.include` option).See below for some examples and a comparison between the modes.|  type | keyword                 | classical | progressive | psychedelic || ----: | ----------------------- | :-------: | :---------: | :---------: || **1** | **`techno`**            |     ✔     |      ✔      |      ✔      || **1** | **`funk`**              |     ✔     |      ✔      |      ✔      || **1** | **`ambient`**           |     ✔     |      ✔      |      ✔      || **1** | **`noise`**             |     ✔     |      ✔      |      ✔      || **1** | **`ambient techno`**    |     ✔     |      ✔      |      ✔      || **2** | **`techno`** **`funk`** |     ✖     |      ✔      |      ✔      || **4** | funky                   |     ✖     |      ✖      |      ✖      || **4** | bleep                   |     ✖     |      ✖      |      ✖      || **3** | funky **`techno`**      |     ✖     |      ✖      |      ✔      || **4** | bleepy beep             |     ✖     |      ✖      |      ✖      || **3** | bleepy beep **`noise`** |     ✖     |      ✖      |      ✔      || **4** | bleepy **`noise`** beep |     ✖     |      ✖      |      ✖      |# UsageThis plug-in uses Bandcamp release URL as `album_id` (`.../album/...` for albums and`.../track/...` for singletons).

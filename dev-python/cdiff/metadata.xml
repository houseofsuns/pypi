Environment variable CDIFF_OPTIONS may be        used to specify default options that will be placed at the beginning        of the argument list.Read diff from local modification in a *Git/Mercurial/Svn* workspace (outputfrom e.g. ``git diff``, ``svn diff``):.. code-block:: bash    cd proj-workspace    cdiff                       # view colored incremental diff    cdiff -s                    # view side by side, use default text width 80    cdiff -s -w 90              # use text width 90 other than default 80    cdiff -s -w 0               # auto set text width based on terminal size    cdiff -s file1 dir2         # view modification of given files/dirs only    cdiff -s -w90 -- -U10       # pass '-U10' to underneath revision diff tool    cdiff -s -w90 -U10          # '--' is optional as it's unknown to cdiff    cdiff -s --cached           # show git staged diff (git diff --cached)    cdiff -s -r1234             # show svn diff to revision 1234Read log with changes in a *Git/Mercurial/Svn* workspace (output from e.g.``git log -p``, ``svn log --diff``), note *--diff* option is new in svn 1.7.0:.. code-block:: bash    cd proj-workspace    cdiff -l                    # read log along with changes    cdiff -ls                   # equivalent to cdiff -l -s, view side by side    cdiff -ls -w90              # set text width 90 as well    cdiff -ls file1 dir2        # see log with changes of given files/dirs onlyEnvironment variable ``CDIFF_OPTIONS`` may be used to specify default optionsthat will be placed at the beginning of the argument list, for example:.. code-block:: bash    export CDIFF_OPTIONS='-s -w0'    cdiff foo                   # equivalent to &quot;cdiff -s -w0 foo&quot;If you feel more comfortable with a command such as ``git cdiff`` to triggerthe cdiff command, you may symlink the executable to one named ``git-cdiff``as follows:.. code-block:: bash    cdiff_dir=$(dirname $(which cdiff))    ln -s &quot;${cdiff_dir}/cdiff&quot; &quot;${cdiff_dir}/git-cdiff&quot;Pipe in a diff:.. code-block:: bash    git log -p -2 | cdiff       # view git log with changes of last 2 commits    git show 15bfa | cdiff -s   # view a given git commit, side by side    svn diff -r1234 | cdiff -s  # view svn diff comparing to given revision    diff -u file1 file2 | cdiff # view diff between two files (note the '-u')    diff -ur dir1 dir2 | cdiff  # view diff between two dirs    # View diff in a GitHub pull request, side by side    curl https://github.com/ymattw/cdiff/pull/11.diff | cdiff -s    # View a patch file in unified or context format, the latter depends on    # command `filterdiff` from package `patchutils` which is available in    # major Linux distros and MacPorts.    #    cdiff -s &lt; foo.patchRedirect output to another patch file is safe:.. code-block:: bash    svn diff -r PREV | cdiff -s &gt; my.patchNotes-----Cdiff has following known issues:- Does not recognize `normal` diff, and depends on ``filterdiff`` (patchutils)  to read `context` diff- Side by side mode has alignment problem for wide chars- Terminal might be in a mess on exception (type ``reset`` can fix it)Pull requests are very welcome, please make sure your changes can pass unittests and regression tests by run ``make test`` (required tool *coverage* canbe installed with ``pip install coverage``).

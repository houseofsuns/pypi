	<longdescription>This project contains the documentation for three functions: `transpose2d`, `window1d`, and `convolution2d`. These functions perform matrix transposition, sliding window generation, and 2D convolution, respectively.de2_1 directory contains the project files, whereas tests contains the tests files. This library was built using poetry and published to pypi.The project can be installed from here https://pypi.org/project/de2-1/## transpose2dThe `transpose2d` function transposes a 2D matrix by flipping its rows and columns. It takes a 2D list of floats as input and returns a 2D list of floats as output.### Arguments- `input_matrix` (List[List[float]]): The input matrix to be transposed. It is expected to be a 2D list of floats.### Returns- `List[List[float]]`: The transposed matrix as a 2D list of floats.### Examples- python input_matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]] - result = transpose2d(input_matrix) print(result) # [[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]]### Notes- The input_matrix should be a 2D list of floats.- The function uses the `zip(*input_matrix)` expression to perform the transpose operation.- The rows of the input_matrix become the columns of the transposed matrix, and vice versa.- The resulting transposed matrix has dimensions (number of columns, number of rows) compared to the input matrix.- The function returns the transposed matrix as a 2D list of floats.## window1dThe `window1d` function generates overlapping windows of a specified size from a 1D input array. It takes a 1D input array and optional parameters for window size, shift, and stride, and returns a list of windows, where each window is either a list or a 1D NumPy array.### Arguments- `input_array` (List | np.ndarray): The 1D input array.- `size` (int): The size of the window.- `shift` (int, optional): The shift value between windows. Default is 1.- `stride` (int, optional): The stride value for moving the window. Default is 1.### Returns- `List[Union[List, np.ndarray]]`: A list of windows, where each window is either a list or a 1D NumPy array.### Raises- `TypeError`: If the input_array is not a list or a 1D NumPy array.- `ValueError`: If the size, shift, or stride is not a positive integer.### Examples- python input_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] size = 3 shift = 2 stride = 1 - result = window1d(input_array, size, shift, stride) - print(result) # [[1, 2, 3], [3, 4, 5], [5, 6, 7], [7, 8, 9]]### Notes- The input_array should be a 1D array, either a list or a 1D NumPy array.- The size represents the length of each window.- The shift determines the step size for moving the window starting position.- The stride determines the step size for moving the window elements.- If the window cannot fit entirely within the input_array, it is skipped.- The function returns a list of windows, where each window is either a list or a 1D NumPy array.## convolution2dThe `convolution2d` function performs 2D convolution on an input matrix using a given kernel. at### Arguments- `input_matrix` (List[List[float]]): The input matrix to be convolved. and is expected to be a 2D list of floats.- `kernel` (List[List[float]]): The 2D kernel to be used for the convolution., and is expected to be a 2D list of floats.### Returns- `List[List[float]]`: The convolved output matrix as a 2D list of floats.－### Examples- python input_matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]] - kernel = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]-  result = convolution2d(input_matrix, kernel) - print(result) # [[5, 9], [16, 27]]### Notes- The input_matrix should be a 2D list of floats. and the kernel should be a 2D list of floats. the convolved output matrix has the same number of rows as the input_matrix and one less column than the kernel. - The function returns the convolved output matrix as a 2D list of floats.### Algorithm1. Initialize an empty output matrix with the same number of rows as the input_matrix and one less column than the kernel.ommes. but not necessarily the same shape. The output matrix will have the same number of rows as the input_matrix and one less column than the kernel.2. Iterate through each element in the input_matrix.3. For each element, iterate through the kernel and apply the kernel to the corresponding element in the input_matrix.4. Accumulate the results of the kernel application and store them in the output matrix.5. Return the output matrix.</longdescription>

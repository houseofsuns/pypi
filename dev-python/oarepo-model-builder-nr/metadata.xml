	<longdescription># NR modelThis github project generates:* `nr-metadata` - runtime support containing marshmallow, serializers, ... for NR metadata (documents and data)* `oarepo-model-builder-nr` - a plugin for oarepo-model-builder to generate ## Incompatible changesNone yet. If you introduce any incompatible changes (vs previous major version),enumerate them here and link the readme file from the previous major versionfor reference.## UsageSee the `examples/model.yaml` file for a skeleton of a repository which uses nr metadata document model. An even easier way is to use the[nrp](https://narodni-repozitar.github.io/developer-docs/docs/technology/invenio/nrp-toolchain/) command to generate a documents- or data- compatible repository. See the same pages to get help about the model contents.## BranchesBranches are always named &quot;aa.bb&quot; and denote the version of the contained metadata schema.## Updating packagePackage needs to be updated whenever the version of oarepo-model-builder and other builder plugins changes and influences the generated files.The package version is always in the form of `aa.bb.ccc`, where `aa.bb` is the versionof the metadata schema and `ccc` is the version of the python package.To rebuild python packages:- [ ] Create a development branch (named after the issue inside linear or github issue)- [ ] Implement your changes- [ ] Increase the version number in `version` file- [ ] Run `build.sh` (note - this has to be run after modification to the `version` file)- [ ] Create a merge request to the `aa.bb` branch- [ ] Create a new github release.## Updating modelTo update the model version, - [ ] start by creating a new branch with the name `aa.bb`, where `aa.bb` represents the new model version.     For example, if the current version is `2.0` and your changes are minor,     the new version should be `2.1`, while major changes warrant     a version bump to `3.0`.- [ ] Set this branch as the default branch on GitHub. - [ ] Rename files inside the `model` directory to include the correct version- [ ] Change the model version inside the `build.sh` script- [ ] Make your modifications to the files within the model directory - [ ] Update the content of the `version` file to reflect the new version as `aa.bb.0`- [ ] Execute the `build.sh` script to ensure that everything builds correctly - [ ] Push your changes to GitHub- [ ] Mark the branch as the default branch- [ ] Create a new GitHub release.</longdescription>

	<longdescription># karp-backend-5**This package is the legacy version of Karp, [go here for the current version(https://github.com/spraakbanken/karp-backend)]**## master[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/spraakbanken/karp-backend-v5/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/spraakbanken/karp-backend-v5)[![](https://github.com/spraakbanken/karp-backend-v5/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/spraakbanken/karp-backend-v5/actions)**This package - code and documentation - is still under construction.**Karp is the lexical platform of Språkbanken.Now migrated to Python 3.6+.# Karp in DockerFor easy testing, use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) to run Karp-b.- Follow the steps given [here](https://github.com/spraakbanken/karp-docker)- Run `docker-compose up -d`- Test it by running `curl localhost:8081/app/test`**If you want to use Karp without Docker, keep on reading.**# Prerequisites- [ElasticSearch6](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/elasticsearch-6-3-0)- SQL, preferrably [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/)- a WSGI server  for example [mod_wsgi](http://modwsgi.readthedocs.io/en/develop/) with [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/), Waitress, Gunicorn, uWSGI. . .- an authentication server. Read more about this [here](https://github.com/spraakbanken/karp-docker/blob/master/dummyauth/README.md)- [Python &gt;= 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/) with [pip](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/stable/installing/)# InstallationKarp uses virtuals envs for python. To get running:- run `make install`- or:  1. Create the virtual environment using `python3 -m venv venv`.  2. Activate the virtual environment with `source venv/bin/activate`.  3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`# ConfigurationSet the environment varibles `KARP5_INSTANCE_PATH` and `KARP5_ELASTICSEARCH_URL`:1. using `export VAR=value`2. or creating a file `.env` in the root of your cloned path with `VAR=value`3. `KARP5_INSTANCE_PATH` - the path where your configs are. If you have cloned this repo you can use `/path/to/karp-backend/`.4. `KARP5_ELASTICSEARCH_URL` - the url to elasticsearch. Typically `localhost:9200`Copy `config.json.example` to `config.json` and make your changes.You will also need to make configurations for your lexicons.Read more [here](doc/manual.md).# TestsTODO: DO MORE TESTS!Run the tests by typing: `make test`Test that `karp-backend` is working by starting it`make run` or `python run.py`# Known bugsCounts from the `statistics` call may not be accurate when performingsubaggregations (multiple buckets) on big indices unless the queryrestricts the search space. Using[`breadth_first`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html#_collect_mode) mode does not (always) help.Possible workarounds:- use [composite aggregation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-composite-aggregation.html) instead, but this does not work with filtering.- set a bigger shard_size (27 000 works for saldo), but this might break your ES cluster.- have smaller indices (one lexicon per index) but this does not help for big lexicons or statistics over many lexicons.- don't allow deeper subaggregations than 2. Chaning the `size` won't help.# ElasticsearchIf saving stops working because of `Database Exception: Error during update. Message: TransportError(403, u'cluster_block_exception', u'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];').`, you need to unlock the relevant ES index.### This is how you do it:Repeat for every combination of `host` and `port` that is relevant for you. But you only need to do it once per cluster.- Check if any index is locked: `curl &lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/_all/_settings/index.blocks*`  - If all is open, Elasticsearch answers with `{}`  - else it answers with `{&lt;index&gt;: { &quot;settings&quot;: { &quot;index&quot;: { &quot;blocks&quot;: {&quot;read_only_allow_delete&quot;: &quot;true&quot;} } } }, ... }`- To unlock all locked indices on a `host` and `port`:  - `curl -X PUT &lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/_all/_settings -H 'Content-Type: application' -d '{&quot;index.blocks.read_only_allow_delete&quot;: null}'`</longdescription>

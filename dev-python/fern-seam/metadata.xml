	<longdescription># Seam Python Library[![pypi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/fern-seam.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fern-seam)[![fern shield](https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%8C%BF-SDK%20generated%20by%20Fern-brightgreen)](https://github.com/fern-api/fern)## DocumentationAPI documentation is available at https://docs.seam.co/latest/api-clients/overview.## InstallationAdd this dependency to your project's build file:```bashpip install fern-seam# orpoetry add fern-seam```## Usage```pythonfrom seamapi import Seamseam_client = Seam(api_key=&quot;MY_API_KEY&quot;)response = seam_client.access_codes.update_and_wait_until_ready(    access_code_id=&quot;my access code id&quot;,    name=&quot;access code name&quot;,    code=&quot;access code&quot;,    starts_at=dt.datetime(2023, 3, 1, 12, 0, 0),    ends_at=dt.datetime(2023, 3, 5, 12, 0, 0),)print(response.access_code_id)```## Async clientThis SDK also includes an async client, which supports the `await` syntax:```pythonfrom seamapi import AsyncSeamseam_client = AsyncSeam(api_key=&quot;MY_API_KEY&quot;)async def update_access_code() -&gt; None:    response = seam_client.access_codes.update_and_wait_until_ready(        access_code_id=&quot;my access code id&quot;,        name=&quot;access code name&quot;,        code=&quot;access code&quot;,        starts_at=dt.datetime(2023, 3, 1, 12, 0, 0),        ends_at=dt.datetime(2023, 3, 5, 12, 0, 0),    )    print(response.access_code_id)asyncio.run(update_access_code())```## Environment VariablesIf your environment has the variable `SEAM_API_KEY` then you don't need to excplicitly pass in an api key. ```from seamapi import Seamseam_client = Seam()```## Beta statusThis SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning the package version to a specific version in your pyproject.toml file. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally looking for the latest version.## ContributingWhile we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically. Additions made directly to this library would have to be moved over to our generation code, otherwise they would be overwritten upon the next generated release. Feel free to open a PR as a proof of concept, but know that we will not be able to merge it as-is. We suggest opening an issue first to discuss with us!On the other hand, contributions to the README are always very welcome!</longdescription>

This is usually set correctly unless you are compiling canproto yourself. This is also called `-DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=1` for cmake.pycapnp has additional development dependencies, including cython and pytest. See requirements.txt for them all.## Building and installationInstall with `pip install pycapnp`. You can set the CC environment variable to control which compiler is used, ie `CC=gcc-8.2 pip install pycapnp`.Or you can clone the repo like so:```bashgit clone https://github.com/capnproto/pycapnp.gitcd pycapnppip install .```If you wish to install using the latest upstream C++ Cap'n Proto:```bashpip install \    --install-option &quot;--libcapnp-url&quot; \    --install-option &quot;https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto/archive/master.tar.gz&quot; \    --install-option &quot;--force-bundled-libcapnp&quot; .```To force bundled python:```bashpip install --install-option &quot;--force-bundled-libcapnp&quot; .```Slightly more prompt error messages using distutils rather than pip.```bashpython setup.py install --force-bundled-libcapnp```The bundling system isn't that smart so it might be necessary to clean up the bundled build when changing versions:```bashpython setup.py clean```## Python VersionsPython 3.7+ is supported.Earlier versions of Python have asyncio bugs that might be possible to work around, but may require significant work (3.5 and 3.6).## DevelopmentGit flow has been abandoned, use master.To test, use a pipenv (or install requirements.txt and run pytest manually).```bashpip install pipenvpipenv installpipenv run pytest```### Binary PackagesBuilding a dumb binary distribution:```bashpython setup.py bdist_dumb```Building a Python wheel distributiion:```bashpython setup.py bdist_wheel```## Documentation/ExampleThere is some basic documentation [here](http://capnproto.github.io/pycapnp/).Make sure to look at the [examples](examples). The examples are generally kept up to date with the recommended usage of the library.The examples directory has one example that shows off pycapnp quite nicely. Here it is, reproduced:```pythonimport osimport capnpimport addressbook_capnpdef writeAddressBook(file):    addresses = addressbook_capnp.AddressBook.new_message()    people = addresses.init('people', 2)    alice = people[0]    alice.id = 123    alice.name = 'Alice'    alice.email = 'alice@example.com'    alicePhones = alice.init('phones', 1)    alicePhones[0].number = &quot;555-1212&quot;    alicePhones[0].type = 'mobile'    alice.employment.school = &quot;MIT&quot;    bob = people[1]    bob.id = 456    bob.name = 'Bob'    bob.email = 'bob@example.com'    bobPhones = bob.init('phones', 2)    bobPhones[0].number = &quot;555-4567&quot;    bobPhones[0].type = 'home'    bobPhones[1].number = &quot;555-7654&quot;    bobPhones[1].type = 'work'    bob.employment.unemployed = None    addresses.write(file)def printAddressBook(file):    addresses = addressbook_capnp.AddressBook.read(file)    for person in addresses.people:        print(person.name, ':', person.email)        for phone in person.phones:            print(phone.type, ':', phone.number)        which = person.employment.which()        print(which)        if which == 'unemployed':            print('unemployed')        elif which == 'employer':            print('employer:', person.employment.employer)        elif which == 'school':            print('student at:', person.employment.school)        elif which == 'selfEmployed':            print('self employed')        print()if __name__ == '__main__':    f = open('example', 'w')    writeAddressBook(f)    f = open('example', 'r')    printAddressBook(f)```Also, pycapnp has gained RPC features that include pipelining and a promise style API. Refer to the calculator example in the examples directory for a much better demonstration:```pythonimport capnpimport socketimport test_capability_capnpclass Server(test_capability_capnp.TestInterface.Server):    def __init__(self, val=1):        self.val = val    def foo(self, i, j, **kwargs):        return str(i * 5 + self.val)def server(write_end):    server = capnp.TwoPartyServer(write_end, bootstrap=Server(100))def client(read_end):    client = capnp.TwoPartyClient(read_end)    cap = client.bootstrap()    cap = cap.cast_as(test_capability_capnp.TestInterface)    remote = cap.foo(i=5)    response = remote.wait()    assert response.x == '125'if __name__ == '__main__':    read_end, write_end = socket.socketpair(socket.AF_UNIX)    # This is a toy example using socketpair.    # In real situations, you can use any socket.    server(write_end)    client(read_end)```Changelog=============## v1.3.0 (2023-01-26)- Update to bundled capnproto-0.10.3- Add Python 3.11 to Github Actions builds (#306)- Prevent race condition in example code (#305)## v1.2.2 (2022-12-01)- Update bundled bundled capnp to 0.8.1 due to CVE-2022-46149- Bundle lib/capnp_api.h and helpers/capabilityHelper.cpp (#301)- Avoid reading random values for reader options from dangling reference (#300)## v1.2.1 (2022-09-11)- Fix packaging for Apple Silicon## v1.2.0 (2022-08-29)- Added support for Apple Silicon## v1.1.1 (2022-05-23)- Added Python 3.10 support- aarch64 wheel support- Fix doc string for `_DynamicResizableListBuilder`- fix for unreleased buffers under mmap (issue 280)## v1.1.0 (2021-06-09)- Validated compatibility with Python 3.10.0b2- Remove all bare except- Improve `_StructModuleWhich` to inherit from `enum.Enum`- Add Union on top level union messages- Fixed memory leak in `_SegmentArrayMessageReader`- Removed many pycodestyle warnings- Avoid crash if `__file__` is not set by importer- Fixed module.pyx `_set_&lt;field&gt;` for boolean fields- Fixed setup.py.tmpl support for `*.c++` files- Fixed `_gen.py` for python3 as `dict_keys` object are not indexable.- Add test data to sdist- Add `pyproject.yaml`- Add missing inheritance to `_Schema` for `_StructSchema`## v1.0.0 (2020-11-20)- Validated Python 3.9 (3.7 and 3.8 are also supported)- Updated package to include LICENSE file- Updated examples to avoid run_forever() as ctrl+c will not work- Adding xfail to pytest cases which fail sometimes due to network port oddities (please use asyncio, as Python handles things more gracefully)## v1.0.0b2 (2020-06-14)- Minimum capnproto version is now 0.8.0- Added asyncio ssl calculator test- Added poll_once to TwoPartyServer API- More cleanup- Fix absolute and circular imports- Fix Promise aliasing issue (Promise to \_Promise)- Documentation update- Updated installation instructions- Added RPC documentation for asyncio## v1.0.0b1 (2019-12-26)- Python 3.7+ required (asyncio support)- TLS/SSL support using asyncio- Windows support- General cleanup- May be incompatible with code written for pycapnp 0.6.4 and lower- Removing pypandoc/pandoc packaging requirement- Minimum capnproto version is now 0.7.0## v0.6.4 (2019-01-31)- Fix bugs in `read_multiple_bytes` (thanks to @tsh56)- Remove end-of-life Python versions 2.6, 3.2, and 3.3.

Python 3.2 still should work fine, but it's more trouble than it's worth to write unicode tests that work in both it and Python2.- Fix problems with null characters in Text/Data fields. Fixes #19## 0.4.0 (2013-12-12)- Initial working version of RPC- Add get_root_as_any to _MessageReader- Add capnp.pxd for public declarations of cython classes- Fix problems compiling with gcc4.7## v0.3.18 (2013-11-05)- Change naming of ReaderOption parameters to be pep8 compliant## v0.3.17 (2013-11-05)- Add ReaderOptions to read/read_packed/from_bytes## v0.3.16 (2013-10-28)- Add defaults flag to capnp-json. Also remove 'which' field- Add capnp-json serializer script. Also fix bugs in from_dict- Fix build for clang/python3. Also remove -fpermissive- Add `as_builder` method to Struct Reader- Add warning when writing the same message more than once- First working version of capability interfaces- Wrap InterfaceSchema- Fix setting string fields to support all types of strings- Fix changed API for DynamicObject/ObjectPointer## v0.3.15 (2013-09-19)- Add not having installed the C++ libcapnp library to 'Common Problems'- Add _short_str function for use in capnp_test_pycapnp.py- Add test script for testing with https://github.com/kaos/capnp_test- Add handling of DynamicObject- Fix lists of lists or dicts for from_dict## v0.3.14 (2013-09-04)- Fix problem with to_dict## v0.3.13 (2013-09-04)- Add _DynamicStructBuilder.to_bytes() and &lt;struct module&gt;.from_bytes()- Change == on StructSchema to return cbool- Add Builder and Reader ABCs for each struct type## v0.3.12 (2013-09-03)- Fix handling of empty path '' in load_module- Add from_dict- Fix bug in exception handling for which(). Also standardize exceptions.- Change import hook to require modules to end in '_capnp'- Add import monkey patch function.- Change naming for functions to conform to PEP 8. Also deprecate old read/write API- Update preferred method for reading/writing messages from files## v0.3.11 (2013-09-01)- Forgot to change project name in setup.py## v0.3.10 (2013-09-01)- Change all references to old project name (change from capnpc-python-cpp to pycapnp)- Change DynamicValue.Reader lists to be returned as _DynamicListReader- Unify setters for DynamicList and DynamicStruct- Add shortcuts for reading from / writing to files.  In Python, it doesn't make much sense to force people to muck around with MessageReaders and MessageBuilders since everything is landing on the heap anyway.  Instead, let's make it easy:  MyType.read[Packed]From(file) reads a file and returns a MyType reader.  MyType.newMessage() returns a MyType builder representing the root of a new message.  You can call this builder's write[Packed]To(file) method to write it to a file.- Store Builders by value rather than allocate them separately on the heap (matches treatment of Readers).  v0.3 fixes the bug that made this not work.- Wrap MessageBuilder::setRoot().- Add tests based on TestAllTypes from the C++ test.capnp.  Fix problems uncovered in capnp.pyx.- Implement __str__ and __repr__ for struct and list builders.  __str__ uses prettyPrint while __repr__ shows the type name and the low-whitespace stringification.  Also implement __repr__ for StructSchema, just because why not?## v0.3.9 (2013-08-30)- Change load to use a global SchemaParser. Make structs settable as field- Add docstrings for new functions and _DynamicResizableListBuilder## v0.3.8 (2013-08-29)- Add initial tests- Add _capnp for original Cython module. Meant for testing.- Lowercase schema so it conforms to member naming conventions- Expose _StructSchema's raw node- Add some useful _StructSchema, reader, and builder methods- Add full orphan functionality. Also, allow special orphan lists- Finish up adding docstrings to all public classes/methods## v0.3.7 (2013-08-26)- Add a ton of docstrings and add to official docs- Add DynamicOrphan## v0.3.6 (2013-08-26)- Add intersphinx for linking to python docs- Add C++ library version check## v0.3.5 (2013-08-25)- Add handling of constants in schemas- Fix new error with DynamicValue.Builder no longer being copyable## v0.3.4 (2013-08-22)- Fix Void namespace change- Updated capnp schema to conform with new union rules## v0.3.3 (2013-08-22)- Fix for the removal of DynamicUnion from the C++ API## v0.3.2 (2013-08-21)- Add MANIFEST.in to include README## v0.3.1 (2013-08-21)- Update docs with lines about upgrading setuptools## 0.3.0 (2013-08-21)- Initial commit of docs- Add querying unnamed enums to structs## 0.2.1 (2013-08-13)- Fix enum interface change for benchmark- Random formatting cleanup- Allow import paths in the schema loader- Add travis CI## 0.2.0 (2013-08-12)- Initial working version</longdescription>

	<longdescription># JIRA Agile MetricsA tool to extract Agile metrics and charts from JIRA projects.## InstallationRequires Python 3.6 or later.Install Python 3 and the `pip` package manager. Then run:    $ pip install jira-agile-metricsYou can do this globally, but you may want to use a virtual Python environment(`venv`) instead to keep things self-contained.See [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](http://python-guide.org/en/latest/) forthe full details about how to install Python and venvs.This should install a binary called `jira-agile-metrics` in the relevant `bin`directory. You can test it using:    $ jira-agile-metrics --help... which should print a help message.### Using DockerIf you prefer, you can use [Docker](http://docker.com) to install and run`jira-agile-metrics` with all the relevant dependencies in place. Afterinstalling Docker, run:    $ docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/data optilude/jira-agile-metrics:latest config.ymlThis will run `jira-agile-metrics` with the configuration file `config.yml` fromthe current directory, writing outputs also to the current directory. Theargument `-v $PWD:/data` mounts the `/data` volume, where output files will bewritten, to the current working directory. You can of course specify adifferent bind mount.### Using Docker in batch modeThere is a second Docker image, which can be used to run multiple config filesin batch mode, for example to generate metrics overnight.To use it, create a directory containing one or more configuration files, withthe extension `.yml` or `.yaml`, and a _different_ directory for the outputs.Assuming these are `/path/to/config` and `/path/to/output`, you can runthe following Docker command periodically, e.g. using `cron` or anotherscheduler:    $ docker run --rm -v /path/to/config:/config -v /path/to/output:/data optilude/jira-agile-metrics:batch-latestWhen this is finished, you should see a directory under the `output` directoryfor each of the config files in the `config` directory, containing the reportsand charts. You will also find a file called `metrics.log` containing the logoutput during the run, which may be helpful in diagnosing any problems.Any command line arguments passed to `docker run` after the image name will bepassed directly to `jira-agile-metrics`. So, for example, if you wanted to usethe `-n` option to limit the number of results fetched from JIRA (for testingpurposes), you can pass `-n 10` (or some different number) at the end of thecommand line above.## UsageThe basic usage pattern is to run `jira-agile-metrics` with a configurationfile, written in YAML format (see below), which describes:- how to connect to a remote JIRA instance (this can also be set using command  line options);- what metrics (spreadsheet-like data files, charts as images) to output;- various settings used to calculate those metrics; and- a description of the stages of the workflow the relevant JIRA tickets go  through.The tool will then connect to JIRA using its web services API, run a query tothe relevant tickets and their history, and calculate the requierd metrics.The outputs are written to local filesystem files. Data files can be written inCSV, XLSX or JSON formats (depending on the extension of the desired outputfile), whilst charts are written as PNG images.### Server mode`jira-agile-metrics` comes with a simple web server that can be used to producemetrics by uploading a configuration file and downloading a ZIP file with dataand charts. To start it, run:    $ jira-agile-metrics --server 5000This will start a server on port `5000` (you can also specify a bind host nameor IP address, e.g. `0.0.0.0:5000`). Visit this address in a web browser andupload a file.In this mode, all other command line options are ignored.**Note:** The web server is designed for low-volume usage only, and does nothave a sophisticated security model. It is simply a more accessible front endto the features of the command line tool. The server will wait, synchronously,whilst JIRA is queried and charts are produced, which can take a long time.During this time, the browser will wait, and threads will block.**Warning:** The web server does not encrypt requests, which means that bydefault JIRA credentials are transmitted in plain-text. You are strongly advicedto configure a reverse proxy (e.g. `nginx`) with SSL enabled in front of it.#### Using Docker to run the web serverThere is a separate Docker image for running the web server, which uses `nginx`and `uwsgi` for improved performance and stability (but still not SSL, whichwould need to be configured with a domain-specific certificate):    $ docker run -d --rm -p 8080:80 --name jira_metrics optilude/jira-agile-metrics:server-latestThis will run the server in daemon mode and bind it to port `8080` on the localhost. To stop it, run:    $ docker stop jira_metricsSee the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com) for more details.### An important note about passwordsThe tool uses a simple username/password combination to connect to JIRA. Youneed to ensure this user exists in the remote JIRA instance, and has therequired permissions.There are three ways to provide the credentials for JIRA -- in particular, thepassword, which should be kept scret. You should think carefully about whichapproach makes most sense for you.- The safest option is to not set it in either the configuration file, or as  a command line option. In this case, you will be prompted to input a  password (and username, if you didn't set this either) each time the tool  is run.- You can use the `--username` and/or `--password` command line options to set  credentails when you invoke the `jira-agile-metrics` command. This keeps  them out of the configuration file, but if you do this in an interactive  shell that records command history (i.e. virtually all of them), your  password will likely be stored in plain text in the command history!- If you are confident you can keep the configuration file secret, you can  store them there, under the `Connection` section (see below).### What issues should you include?The most common use case is to calculate metrics for a team using a JIRA issuetype called something like `Story`, going through a workflow with stages like`Backlog`, `Committed`, `Elaboration`, `Build`, `Code review`, `Test`, and `Done`,and allowing a set of resolutions like `Completed`, `Withdrawn`, and `Duplicate`.`jira-agile-metrics` lets you use JIRA JQL syntax to specify which issues youare interested in. See the JIRA documentation for more details (or construct asearch using the JIRA UI and then have JIRA show you the corresponding JQL).### Creating a configuration fileHere is an example configuration file for a basic example using the workflowabove:    # How to connect to JIRA. Can also include `Username` and `Password`    Connection:        Domain: https://myjira.atlassian.net # your JIRA instance    # What issues to search for. Uses JQL syntax.    Query: Project=ABC AND IssueType=Story AND (Resolution IS NULL OR Resolution IN (Completed, Withdrawn))    # The workflow we want to analyse. By convention, the first stage should be    # the backlog / initial state, and the final stage should indicate the work    # is done.    #    # We map analytics names to JIRA status names. It's possible to collapse    # multiple JIRA statuses into a single workflow stage, as with `QA` below.    Workflow:         Backlog: Backlog        Committed: Committed        Elaboration: Elaboration        Build: Build        QA:            - Code review            - Test        Done: Done    # What outputs to produce. These are all optional. If an option isn't set    # the relevant metric will not be produced.    Output:        # CSV files with raw data for input to other tools or further analysis in a spreadsheet        # If you use .json or .xlsx as the extension, you can get JSON data files or Excel        # spreadsheets instead        Cycle time data:            - cycletime.csv            - cycletime.json        CFD data: cfd.csv        Scatterplot data: scatterplot.csv        Histogram data: histogram.csv        Throughput data: throughput.csv        Percentiles data: percentiles.csv        # Various charts        Scatterplot chart: scatterplot.png        Scatterplot chart title: Cycle time scatter plot        Histogram chart: histogram.png        Histogram chart title: Cycle time histogram        CFD chart: cfd.png        CFD chart title: Cumulative Flow Diagram        Throughput chart: throughput.png        Throughput chart title: Throughput trend        Burnup chart: burnup.png        Burnup chart title: Burn-up        Burnup forecast chart: burnup-forecast.png        Burnup forecast chart title: Burn-up forecast        Burnup forecast chart trials: 100 # number of Monte Carlo trials to run to estimate completion date        # Burnup forecast chart throughput window: 60 # Days in the past to use for calculating historical throughput        # Burnup forecast chart throughput window end: 2018-06-01 # Calculate throughput window to this date (defaults to today)        # Burnup forecast chart target: 100 # items to complete in total; by default uses the current size of the backlog        # Burnup forecast chart deadline: 2018-06-01 # deadline date, in ISO format; if not set, no deadline is drawn.        # Burnup forecast chart deadline confidence: .85 # percentile to use to compare forecast to deadline        WIP chart: wip.png        WIP chart title: Work in Progress        Ageing WIP chart: ageing-wip.png        Ageing WIP chart title: Ageing WIP        Net flow chart: net-flow.png        Net flow chart title: Net flowHint: If you prefer to manage your queries as saved filters in JIRA, you canuse the special JQL syntax of `filter=123`, where `123` is the filter ID.If you save this file as e.g. `config.yaml`, you can run:    $ jira-agile-metrics config.yamlThis should prompt you for a username and password, and then connect to yourJIRA instance, fetch the issues matching the query, calculate metrics, andwrite a number of CSV and PNG files to the current working directory (you canuse the `--output-directory` option to write to another directory).When testing configuration, it is often helpful to fetch just a small number ofissues to speed things up. You can either do this by making your query morerestrictive, or by using the `-n` flag to limit the number of issues fetched:    $ jira-agile-metrics -n 20 config.yamlIf you want more information about what's going on, use the `-v` flag:    $ jira-agile-metrics -v config.yamlAnd if you are realy curious:    $ jira-agile-metrics -vv config.yaml## Reusing elements of a config fileIf you want to reuse some configuration elements (e.g., `Connection`,`Workflow`) across multiple configuration files, you can use the `Extends`option to &quot;import&quot; one file into another.For example, if you had a file called `common.yaml` with:    Connection:        Domain: https://myjira.atlassian.net    Workflow:         Backlog: Backlog        Committed: Committed        Elaboration: Elaboration        Build: Build        QA:            - Code review            - Test        Done: Done    Output:        Quantiles:            - 0.5            - 0.75            - 0.95Another file, e.g. `team1.yaml`, could then reuse these settings with:    Extends: common.yaml    Output:        Cycle time data: team1-cycletime.csv        CFD chart: team1-cfd.png        CFD chart title: Team 1: CFDThe extended filename is resolved relative to the file being loaded, so inthis example they would be in the same directory. You can use relative orabsolute paths. Note that the path separator for relative paths is always `/`(forward slash), even on Windows!When one file extends another, the extending file can override any optionsset in the extended file. So, for example, if `team1.yaml` also set `Quantiles`under `Output`, the list from `common.yaml` would be overridden in its entirety.This is the case for any option under `Output`, and for the `Query` / `Queries`and `Workflow` options in their entirety. Any `Attributes` will be merged.You can use `Extends` recursively, i.e. an extended file can extend anotherfile.**Note:** The `Extends` feature is not available in server mode. If a file withan `Extends` line is uploaded to the server, an error will be thrown.## Available metrics`jira-agile-metrics` can produce a number of data files and charts, which canbe enabled in the `Output` section of the configuration file, or with acorresponding command line option.**Note:** In the configuration file, you can specify output file *names*, butnot absolute or relative paths. Files will always be written to the currentworking directory. This is to prevent unexpeced behaviour and the potential ofoverwriting other files when configuration files are moved around or used ona remote machine. No such restriction applies to output files specified incommand line arguments.### Cycle time detailsDetails about each ticket and the date it entered each stage of the workflow.Both the CSV and JSON versions of this file can be used by the[Actionable Agile Analytics](http://actionableagile.com/) tool, which offerspowerful, interactive analysis of Agile flow.In the configuration file:    Output:        Cycle time data: cycletime.csvYou can also use `.json` or `.xlsx` formats. To output multiple files, use alist like:    Output:        Cycle time data:            - cycletime.json            - cycletime.xlsx            - cycletime.csvNote: the &quot;Blocked Days&quot; calculation relies on the &quot;Flagged&quot; feature in JIRA,showing the total number of days (rounded up to the nearest whole day) that eachticket was flagged as impeded. Impediments raised whilst the ticket is in thebacklog or done do not count.### Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD)Raw data for creating a valid Cumulative Flow Diagram, in spreadsheet format,and/or an image file of the same. The CFD shows the number of work items ineach stage of the flow as a stacked area chart, day by day. This allows us tovisualise WIP, cycle time, and throughput.![](./docs/images/cfd.png)In the configuration file:    Output:        CFD data: cfd.csv        CFD chart: cfd.png        CFD chart title: Cumulative Flow DiagramYou can also use `.json` or `.xlsx` formats for the data file.  To outputmultiple files, use a list like:    Output:        CFD data:            - cfd.json            - cfd.xlsx            - cfd.csvTo only show the 30 most recent days in the chart:        CFD window: 30### Cycle time scatter plotRaw data for creating a valid Cycle Time scatter plot graph, and/or an imagefile of the same. This chart plots the end-to-end cycle time (excluding timespent in the backlog) for each work item against its completion date, andoverlays quantiles (e.g. 85% of tickets took 18 days or fewer)![](./docs/images/scatterplot.png)In the configuration file:    Output:        Scatterplot data: scatterplot.csv        Scatterplot chart: scatterplot.png        Scatterplot chart title: Cycle time scatter plotYou can also use `.json` or `.xlsx` formats for the data file. To outputmultiple files, use a list like:    Output:        Scatterplot data:            - scatterplot.json            - scatterplot.xlsx            - scatterplot.csvBy default, the quantiles used are the 50th, 85th and 95th percentile, but youcan specify a different list with the `Quantiles` option under `Output`:        Quantiles:            - 0.3            - 0.5            - 0.75            - 0.85            - 0.95Note that this option affects all charts that use quantiles.To get the quantile values (number of day at each quantile) in a data file, use:        Percentiles data: percentiles.csvTo only show the 30 most recent days in the chart:        Scatterplot window: 30### Cycle time histogramThis is a different view of the cycle time , calculatd and/or plotted as ahistogram.![](./docs/images/histogram.png)In the configuration file:    Output:        Histogram data: histogram.csv        Histogram chart: histogram.png        Histogram chart title: Cycle time histogramYou can also use `.json` or `.xlsx` formats for the data file. To outputmultiple files, use a list like:    Output:        Histogram data:            - histogram.json            - histogram.xlsx            - histogram.csvThis also respects the `Quantiles` option (see above).To only show the 30 most recent days in the chart:        Histogram window: 30### ThroughputWeekly throughput, i.e. the number of items completed week by week. The chartalso shows a trend line.![](./docs/images/throughput.png)In the configuration file:    Output:        Throughput data: throughput.csv        Throughput chart: throughput.png        Throughput chart title: Throughput trendYou can also use `.json` or `.xlsx` formats for the data file.To change the frequency from weekly to something else, use:        Throughput frequency: 1DHere, `1D` means daily. The default is `1W-MON`, which means weekly starting onMondays.To only show the 6 most recent periods (e.g. weeks) in the chart:        Throughput window: 6### WIP box plotShows a box plot of WIP, week by week (or some other frequency).![](./docs/images/wip.png)In the configuration file:        WIP chart: wip.png        WIP chart title: Work in ProgressTo change the frequency from weekly to something else, use:        WIP frequency: 1DHere, `1D` means daily. The default is `1W-MON`, which means weekly starting onMondays.To only show the 6 most recent periods (e.g. weeks) in the chart:        WIP window: 6### Net flow chartShows the difference between arrivals and departures week on week. In aperfectly stable system, the net flow would be 0.![](./docs/images/net-flow.png)In the configuration file:        Net flow chart: net-flow.png        Net flow chart title: Net flowTo change the frequency from weekly to something else, use:        Net flow frequency: 1DHere, `1D` means daily. The default is `1W-MON`, which means weekly starting onMondays.To only show the 6 most recent periods (e.g. weeks) in the chart:        Net flow window: 6### Ageing WIP chartShows the cycle time to date for each work item, grouped into the stages ofthe workflow. This can help identify slow-moving tickets.![](./docs/images/ageing-wip.png)In the configuration file:        Ageing WIP chart: ageing-wip.png        Ageing WIP chart title: Ageing WIP### Burn-up chartA basic Agile burn-up chart, based on a count of items completed and in thebacklog.![](./docs/images/burnup.png)In the configuration file:        Burnup chart: burnup.png        Burnup chart title: Burn-upTo only show the 30 most recent days in the chart:        Burnup window: 30### Burn-up chart with forecast lineA more advanced version of the burn-up chart, which will run a Monte Carlosimulation based on historical throughput to forecast a completion date forthe scope.![](./docs/images/burnup-forecast.png)The simulation can be calibrated with a series of options to set:- The number of trials to run. Each trial will be drawn as a hypotehtical  burn-up to completion.- The window of time from which to sample historical throughput. This should  be representative of the near future, and ideally about 6-12 weeks long.- The target to aim for, as a number of stories to have completed. Defaults  to the size of the backlog, but can be set to an assumed figure.- A deadline date, which, if set, can be compared to a forecast at a given  confidence interval.In the configuration file:        Burnup forecast chart: burnup-forecast.png        Burnup forecast chart title: Burn-up forecast        Burnup forecast chart trials: 100 # number of Monte Carlo trials to run to estimate completion date        Burnup forecast chart throughput window: 60 # Days in the past to use for calculating historical throughput        Burnup forecast chart throughput window end: 2018-06-01 # Calculate throughput window to this date (defaults to last day of burnup)        Burnup forecast chart target: 100 # items to complete in total; by default uses the current size of the backlog        Burnup forecast chart deadline: 2018-06-01 # deadline date, in ISO format; if not set, no deadline is drawn.        Burnup forecast chart deadline confidence: .85 # percentile to use to compare forecast to deadlineTo only show the 30 most recent days in the chart:        Burnup forecast window: 30## ImpedimentsIf you use the &quot;Flagged&quot; feature in JIRA to mark (and unmark) tickets as impededwhen they are blocked, you can produce charts showing the number of impedimentsraised, and the cumulative amount of time tickets have spent being impeded,broken down by month and either the flag set or the the workflow stage a ticketwas in when the flag was set. You can also write out the impediment events to afile.![](./docs/images/impediments.png)![](./docs/images/impediments-days.png)![](./docs/images/impediments-status.png)![](./docs/images/impediments-status-days.png)The charts can be enabled with:    Impediments data: impediments.csv    Impediments window: 6    Impediments chart: impediments.png    Impediments chart title: Number of impediments    Impediments days chart: impediments-days.png    Impediments days chart title: Total impeded days    Impediments status chart: impediments-status.png    Impediments status chart title: Number of impediments by status    Impediments status days chart: impediments-status-days.png    Impediments status days chart title: Total impeded days by statusNote that by default, only a single value (`&quot;Impediment&quot;`) is available for the`Flagged` field in JIRA, and indeed only one field can be set when using the`&quot;Set flag&quot;` option on a JIRA Agile board. However, you can enable additionalvalues in the field configuration for the relevant field, and make that fieldavailable on the issue edit screen.The `Impediments window`, which is optional, can be used to limit the chart toshowing only the most recent months' data: six in this case.The `Impediments chart` and `Impediments status chart` will count the number ofimpediment events that were active each month, i.e. a ticket was flagged asimpeded at some point during the month.The `Impediments days chart` and `Impediments status days chart` uses the sameunderlying logic, but instead of counting impediments, it sums the number ofdays of all impediments in each month.Note that:- Impediments raised against tickets in the backlog or in the &quot;done&quot; column are  not shown.- If a ticket is flagged and then resolved before being unflagged, the impeded  time is calculated to the resolution date.- If a ticket is still flagged at the time the chart is generated, the impeded  day count will run to today's date.- Blocking time is always rounded up to the nearest whole day.## Defect densityThree charts for analysing the amount of defects that have been openhistorically, grouped in various ways into stacked bar graphs.![](./docs/images/defects-by-priority.png)![](./docs/images/defects-by-type.png)![](./docs/images/defects-by-environment.png)These charts all rely on a separate JIRA query:    Defects query: issueType = BugAgain, you can use the `filter=123` JQL syntax to delegate the query specificsto a named filtered.The three available groupings are:- Show how many defects remained open each month, grouped by _priority_.- Show how many defects remained open each month, grouped by _type_.- Show how many defects remained open each month, grouped by _environment_.They each require you to specify the name of the relevant field, and a chartoutput. You can also optionally specify a list of allowed values for each field,which lets you control the order. Finally, you can specify a &quot;window&quot; of howmany of the most recent months to show (the default is to show all months forwhich there is data). Here is an example that enables all charts, and limits toshowing the six most recent months in each:    Defects query: issueType = Bug    Defects window: 6    Defects priority field: Priority    Defects priority values:        - Low        - Medium        - High    Defects type field: Root cause    Defects type values:        - Config        - Data        - Code    Defects environment field: Environment    Defects environment values:        - SIT        - UAT        - PROD    Defects by priority chart: defects-by-priority.png    Defects by priority chart title: Defects by priority    Defects by type chart: defects-by-type.png    Defects by type chart title: Defects by type    Defects by environment chart: defects-by-environment.png    Defects by environment chart title: Defects by environmentIf you omit any of the chart names, the relevant chart will not be produced. Ifyou omit any of the field names, the relevant chart will not be stacked. If youomit the values list, all unique values will be shown.## Technical debtTwo charts that show the nature and age of recorded (unresolved) technical debt.![](./docs/images/tech-debt.png)![](./docs/images/tech-debt-age.png)These require a separate JIRA query. You should also identify the fieldindicating priority:    Debt query: issueType = &quot;Tech debt&quot;    Debt priority field: Priority    Debt priority values:        - Low        - Medium        - HighAs ever, use `filter=123` to use a named filter instead. If you omit the`Debt priority values` option, all unique priority values will be used, inalphabetical order.The first chart shows the open technical debt items each month as a stacked barchart grouped by priority. You can optionally specify a &quot;window&quot; to show onlya limited number of the most recent months:    Debt window: 3    Debt chart: tech-debt.png    Debt chart title: Technical debtThe second chart shows the number of open technical debt items by their currentage in days, broken down by priority, and stacked into &quot;bins&quot;:    Debt age chart: tech-debt-age.png    Debt age chart title: Technical debt age    Debt age chart bins:        - 30        - 60        - 90This will use the age brackets 0-30 days, 31-60 days, 61-90 days, and over 90days (which also happens to be the default).## Waste (withdrawn items)This chart shows how many work items are withdrawn or cancelled after workhas started. It relies on a separate JIRA query, and assumes that withdrawnwork items are all &quot;resolved&quot; in JIRA. Moreover, it assumes that these workitems follow the same workflow as that used for the other charts and files,i.e. as mapped in the `Workflow` section of the configuration file.![](./docs/images/waste.png)Here is an example:    Waste query: issueType = Story AND resolution IN (Withdrawn, Invalid)    Waste window: 10    Waste frequency: 2W-WED    Waste chart: waste.png    Waste chart title: WasteThis will show withdrawn items broken down by the period in which they werewithdrawn for the the 10 most recent periods. The default period length ismonthlyasfd, but here we have set it to `2W-WED`, which means a two-week periodstarting on a Wednesday. `Waste window` and `Waste frequency` are bothoptional.## Progress reportAn status report that uses Monte Carlo simulation forecasting at the epiclevel.The report is presented as a self-contained HTML file with embeddedimages. It relies on a small number of commonly used, externally hostedlibraries (the *Bootstrap* CSS/JS library and its *jQuery* dependency; the*Fontawesome* icon font), but can be served from any static web server or openedas a local file on any modern web browser. It should also print reasonably well,although the embedded images showing context-specific Cumulative Flow Diagramsand Cycle Time Scatter Plots are only accessible by clicking on the relevanticons in a browser.![](./docs/images/progressreport.png)The status report is based on the principle of *outcomes* (e.g. projects,releases, objectives) that are broken down into *epics*, which will eventuallybe further broken down into *stories*. Epics are assumed to be fully owned byexactly one *team*. Epics and stories are represented by JIRA ticketsdiscoverable by JQL queries specified in the configuration file, whereasoutcomes and teams are enumerated in the configuration file directly.A forecast to complete is then produced for each epic by calculating:- the presumed number of stories in the epic (randomly sampling between a  minimum and maximum number of stories as set on the epic ticket in JIRA, or  using the total number of stories raised against the epic, if higher);- the number of stories raised against the epic that have been completed to  date;- and the presumed throughput of the relevant team (randomly sampled, either  from a range of the minimum to maximum number of stories the team can complete  per week, or through a JQL query that identifies the team's historical  performance).This is done many times over in a Monte Carlo simulation, to identify a range ofplausible completion dates. If a deadline is set on an epic, the forecast tocomplete will be compared with it, to highlight the likelihood of hitting thedeadline. (Deadlines may also be set at the outcome-level, in which case theoutcome deadline is the default for all epics.)The simulation takes into account that a single team may have multiple epics tocomplete. A team can be configured to have an epic WIP limit of 1 (the default)or more. If the team is working on more than one epic at a time, it is assumedto distribute its throughout roughly evenly across all active epics, and to workthrough the epics in the order in which their respective outcomes are listed inthe configuration file, and then in the order in which they are returned by thequery used to find them.Here is a complete example configuration file that produces a report akin tothe screenshot above:    Connection:        # not shown    # ...    # Used for calculating progress against an epic, and team throughput: to    # identify whether stories are in the backlog, in progress, or completed.

The special        # placeholder `{outcome}` will be replaced by the outcome key (or name,        # if the key is not set). May be overridden by the `Epic query` set on        # an individual outcome. If not set, the `Epic query` must be specified        # on each outcome, and it is not possible to use outcomes as tickets.        Progress report epic query template: project = ABC AND type = Epic AND Outcome = {outcome} ORDER BY created        # The query used to identify stories for an epic. The placeholders        # `{epic}`, `{outcome}`, and `{team}` may be used to parameterise the        # query.        Progress report story query template: project = ABC AND type = Story AND &quot;Epic link&quot; = {epic}        # A list of teams. At least one team is required, and each team must        # have a `Name` and *either* `Min throughput` and `Max throughput`        # (stories per week), *or* a query in `Throughput samples`. `WIP`        # (number of epics the team may work on in parallel) and        # `Throughput samples window` (number of weeks in the past from which to        # draw samples) are optional. The placeholder `{team}` can be used to        # reference the team name in the samples query.        Progress report teams:            - Name: Red              Min throughput: 5              Max throughput: 10            - Name: Blue              WIP: 2              Throughput samples: project = ABC AND type = Story AND Team = {team}              Throughput samples window: 6        # A list of outcomes. May be omitted, in which case epics will not be        # grouped into outcomes and the `Progress report epic query template`        # specifies a non-parameterised query for all relevant epics. If        # included, each outcome must have a `Name`. `Key`, which is used in        # the epic query template, is optional, defaulting to the same value as        # `Name`. `Deadline` can be used to specify a deadline for all epics        # in the report, which can be overridden on a per-epic basis.        # `Epic query` may be used to specify a particular query for        # epics, overriding the more general `Progress report epic query template`.        Progress report outcomes:            - Name: MVP              Key: O1              Deadline: 2019-01-01            - Name: Asia launch              Key: O2            - Name: Europe revamp              Key: O3              Epic query: project = ABC and type = FeatureIn this example, we have listed the outcomes explicitly in the configurationfile. It is also possible for the outcomes to be managed as JIRA ticket (or evento mix the two approaches). To do this, you need to specify a query for findingthe outcomes:        Progress report outcome query: project = ABC AND type = Outcome AND resolution IS EMPTY ORDER BY summary        # Optionally give a field name for the outcome-level deadline, which        # will be used as a fallback if epic-level deadlines are not set        Progress report outcome deadline field: Due dateIf using tickets to specify outcomes, `Progress report epic query template` mustbe set. The `{outcome}` placeholder will be replaced by the relevant outcometicket `key`. You can thus use a linked issue field to specify the outcome.In a simpler use case, you can model a single team performing all work, and/ordispense with the &quot;outcome&quot; level entirely, modelling only epics. The estimatedmin/max story count and the entire concept of deadlines are also optional.Here is a minimal example:    # ...    Workflow:        Backlog: Backlog        Committed: Next        Build: Build        Test:            - Code review            - QA        Done: Done    Output:        Quantiles:            - 0.75            - 0.85            - 0.95        Progress report: progress-minimal.html        Progress report title: Acme Corp Websites        Progress report epic min stories field: Story count        Progress report epic query template: project = ABC AND type = Epic AND resolution IS EMPTY ORDER BY created        Progress report story query template: project = ABC AND type = Story AND &quot;Epic link&quot; = {epic}        Progress report teams:            - Name: Default              Min throughput: 5              Max throughput: 10You can also turn off forecasts for some or all teams, if you don't haveconfidence in the predictability of team pace or in the underlying data quality.You will still get the progress bars and charts. In this case, you can eitheromit the `Min throughput` / `Max throughput` fields for a specific team, or omit the `Progress report teams` section in its entirety.Team names will be taken from the relevant field on epics (presuming an epicteam field name is specified):    # ...    Workflow:        Backlog: Backlog        Committed: Next        Build: Build        Test:            - Code review            - QA        Done: Done    Output:        Quantiles:            - 0.75            - 0.85            - 0.95        Progress report: progress-teams.html        Progress report title: Acme Corp Websites        Progress report epic min stories field: Story count        Progress report epic query template: project = ABC AND type = Epic AND resolution IS EMPTY ORDER BY created        Progress report story query template: project = ABC AND type = Story AND &quot;Epic link&quot; = {epic}        Progress report epic team field: TeamTechnically you can omit both the teams list (so no forecasts) and the teamfield name, in which case you just get a breakdown of the epics with noforecasting or grouping.Also note that if you do specify a list of teams and an epic team field, thelist of teams will be automatically extended with any team names found that arenot explicitly listed in the configuration.## More details about the configuration file formatThe configuration file is written in YAML format. If you are unfamiliar withYAML, know that:* Comments start with `#`* Sections are defined with a name followed by a colon, and then an indented  block underneath. `Connection`, `Output`, `Workflow` and `Attributes` area  all sections in the example above.* Indentation has to use spaces, not tabs!* Single values can be set using `Key: value` pairs. For example,  `Burnup chart: burnup.png` above sets the key `Burnup chart` to the value  `burnup.png`.* Lists of values can be set by indenting a new block and placing a `-` in front  of each list value. In the example above, the `QA` list contains  the values `Code review` and `Test`.The sections for `Workflow` is required. Additionally, you must either specfiy asingle `Query`, or a block of `Queries` (see below). Connection details mustbe set either in the `Connection` file or as command line arguments.Under `Workflow`, at least two steps are required. Specify the steps in order.You may either specify a single workflow value or a list (as shown for `QA`above), in which case multiple JIRA statuses will be collapsed into a singlestate for analytics purposes.The file, and values for things like workflow statuses and attributes, are caseinsensitive.### Extracting additional attributesYou may want to add additional fields to the cycle time output data. Use an`Attributes` block to do this:    Attributes:        Priority: Priority        Release: Fix version/s        Team: Team nameHere, three additional columns will be added: `Priority`, `Release` and `Team`,corresponding to the JIRA fields `Priority`, `Fix version/s` and `Team name`,respectively.When specifying attributes, use the *name* of the field (as rendered on screenin JIRA), not its id (as you might do in JQL), so e.g. use `Component/s` not`components`.The attributes `Type` (issue type), `Status` and `Resolution` are alwaysincluded.### Multi-valued fieldsSome fields in JIRA can contain multiple values, e.g. `fixVersion`. By default,the extractor will use the first value in such a field if one is specified inthe `Attributes` block. However, you may want to extract only specific values.To do so, add a block like the following::    Attributes:        Release: Fix version/s    Known values:        Release:            - &quot;R01&quot;            - &quot;R02&quot;            - &quot;R03&quot;The extractor will pick the first &quot;known value&quot; found for the field. If none ofthe known values match, the cell will be empty.### Combining multiple queriesIf it is difficult to construct a single set of criteria that returns allrequired issues, multiple queries can be added into a `Queries` block, like so:    Queries:        Attribute: Team        Criteria:            - Value: Team 1              JQL: (filter=123)            - Value: Team 2              JQL: (filter=124)In this example, two queries will be run, based on the two filters `123` and`124` (you can use any valid JQL).In the cycle time output, a new column called `Team` will be added, as specifiedby the `Attribute` field under `Queries`. For all items returned bythe first query, the value will be `Team 1` as per the `Value` field, and forall items returned by the second query, it will be `Team 2`.## Troubleshooting* If Excel complains about a `SYLK` format error, ignore it. Click OK. See  https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/215591.* JIRA error messages may be printed out as HTML in the console. The error is  in there somewhere, but may be difficult to see. Most likely, this is either  an authentication failure (incorrect username/password or blocked account),  or an error in the `Query` option resulting in invalid JQL.* If you aren't getting the issues you expected to see, use the `-v` option to  see the JQL being sent to JIRA. Paste this into the JIRA issue filter search  box (&quot;Advanced mode&quot;) to see how JIRA evaluates it.* Old workflow states can still be part of an issue's history after a workflow  has been modified. Use the `-v` option to find out about workflow states that  haven't been mapped.* Excel sometimes picks funny formats for data in CSV files. Just set them to  whatever makes sense.* If you are on a Mac and you get an error about Python not being installed as  a framework, try to create a file `~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc` with the  following contents:    backend : Agg* To install the charting dependencies on a Mac, you might need to install a  `gfortran` compiler for `scipy`. Use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) and install the  `gcc` brew.## Output settings referenceThe following options can be set in the `Output:` section of the configurationfile.### General optionsThese options affect multiple charts and files.- `Quantiles: &lt;list&gt;` – Quantiles to use when calculating percentiles.- `Backlog column: &lt;name&gt;` --Name of the backlog column.

Each matching  issue will be used as an outcome, with the outcome key for the epic query  template being the issue key and the issue summary being the outcome title.  If used, `Progress report epic query template` *must* be set.- `Progress report epic deadline field: &lt;fieldname&gt;` – Name of a date field   giving the deadline of an outcome. Used as a fallback if no epic-level   deadline is set. Optional.## Changelog### 0.24- Allow using either field id or title for field names in the progress report.- Fix several errors that would occur when running with no defined teams or  outcomes in the configuration file.### 0.23- Allow deadline to be set on outcomes as a fallback for epic level deadlines- Add support for `Progress report outcome query` and  `Progress report outcome deadline field`.- Allow progress report to run without a forecast for some/all teams.- Allow progress report to be run without teams being explicitly defined.  Team names are picked up from the epic teams field if specified, and no  forecasting will take place for such teams.- Add target and deadline lines to epic level CFDs in progress report.- Add out-come level CFD in progress reports.### 0.22- Add support for `Extends` in config file.- Allow `-o` as an alias for `--output-directory`### 0.21- Allow progress report output to be viewed by team as well as by outcome.### 0.20- Use a cumulative distribution function definition of a percentile when  calculating chance of hitting the deadilne (basically: if the deadline is  in the same week as the forecast worst case date, treat it as 100% not 50%  likely)### 0.19- Fix a crash with newer versions of Pandas calculating CFD charts### 0.18- Don't show a forecast for epics that are complete### 0.17- Make logging output date/time and logging level again for easier debugging### 0.16- Attempted fix for throughput calculator crashing in some edge cases### 0.15- Brown bag### 0.14- Force min/max stories fields to integers even if string fields in JIRA- Log which state change caused a backward move### 0.13- Make sure change history is always iterated in date order, even if JIRA returns  them differently.### 0.12- Preserve background colour in print CSS for progress report- Allow use of `{team}` placeholder in team throughput sample query.### 0.11- Added progress report calculator- Fixed issue with web server where template would not load if the package was  installed as an egg (i.e. not from source)### 0.10* Make it possible to optionally specify multiple output files (via YAML lists)  for `* data:` file names. The use case here is to output both a CSV/XLSX and  JSON version of the `cycletime` calculations, for example.* Stop swallowing exceptions in calculators (but keep on doing so when writing  output files). It's too confusing to debug problems.### 0.9* Made the default impediments charts use the impeded flag value as breakdown,  and added specific `Impediments status *` charts for breakdown by status.### 0.8* Added `--http-proxy` and `--https-proxy` options to command line, and  corresponding `HTTP Proxy` and `HTTPS Proxy` in the `Connection` section.### 0.7* Turn throughput chart into a line chart### 0.6* Don't log every list value resolution at debug### 0.5* Added batch mode docker image### 0.4* Added impediments charts### 0.3* Added debt, defects, and waste charts.* Added `window` options to most charts.### 0.2* Added `--output-directory` option.### 0.1* Forked from `jira-agile-metrics`</longdescription>

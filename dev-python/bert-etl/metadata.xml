	<longdescription>[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/bert-etl/badge/?version=latest)](https://bert-etl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)# BertA microframework for simple ETL solutions.## ArchitectureAt its core, `bert-etl` uses Dynamodb Streams to communicate between lambda functions. `bert-etl.yaml` provides control on how the initial lambda function is called, either by periodic events, sns topics, or s3 bucket (planned)events. Passing an event to `bert-etl` is straight forward from `zappa` or a generic AWS lambda function you've hooked up to API Gateway.At this moment in time, there are no plans to attach API Gateway to `bert-etl.yaml` because there is already great software(like `zappa`) that does this.## Warning: aws-lambda deploy target still considered beta`bert-etl` ships with a deploy target to `aws-lambda`. This feature isn't very well documented yet, and has quite a bit of work to de done so it may function more consistently. Be aware that `aws-lambda` is a product ran and controlled by AWS. If you incure charges using `bert-etl` while utilizing `aws-lambda`, you may not consider us responsible. `bert-etl` is offered under `MIT` license which includes a `Use at your own risk` clause.## Begin withLets begin with an example of loading data from a file-server and than loading it into numpy arrays```$ virtualenv -p $(which python3) env$ source env/bin/activate$ pip install bert-etl$ pip install librosa # for demo project$ docker run -p 6379:6379 -d redis # bert-etl runs on redis to share data across CPUs$ bert-runner.py -n demo$ PYTHONPATH='.' bert-runner.py -m demo -j sync_sounds -f```## Release Notes### 0.3.0* Added Error Management. When an error occurs, bert-runner will log the error and re-run the job. If the same error happens often enough, the job will be aborted### 0.2.1* Added Release Notes### 0.2.0* Added Redis Service auto run. Using docker, redis will be pulled and started in the background* Added Redis Service channels, sometimes you'll want to run to etl-jobs on the same machine## Fund Bounty Target UpgradesBert provides a boiler plate framework that'll allow one to write concurrent ETL code using Pythons' `microprocessing` module. One function starts the process, piping data into a Redis backend that'll then be consumed by the next function. The queues are respectfully named for the scope of the function: Work(start) and Done(end) queue. Please consider contributing to Bert Bounty Targets to improve this documentationhttps://www.patreon.com/jbcurtin## Roadmap* Create configuration file, `bert-etl.yaml`* Support conda venv* Support pyenv venv* Support dynamodb flush* Support multipule invocations per AWS account* Support undeploy AWS Lambda* Support Bottle functions in AWS Lambda## Tutorial Roadmap* Introduce Bert API* Explain `bert.binding`* Explain `comm_binder`* Explain `work_queue`* Explain `done_queue`* Explain `ologger`* Explain `DEBUG` and how turning it off allows for x-concurrent processes* Show an example on how to load timeseries data, calcualte the mean, and display the final output of the mean* Expand the example to show how to scale the application implicitly* Show how to run locally using Redis* Show how to run locally without Redis, using Dynamodb instead* Show how to run remotly using AWSLambda and Dynamodb * Talk about dynamodb and eventual consistency</longdescription>

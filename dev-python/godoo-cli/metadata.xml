	<longdescription># gOdoo Dev Environment![OdooLogo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenJKSoftware/gOdoo/main/assets/odoo_logo.png)![ComposeLogo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/compose/v2/logo.png)[&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenJKSoftware/gOdoo/main/assets/godoo-main-cli.png&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot;/&gt;](image.png)**gOdoo** is short for **go Odoo**. \It is a [Vscode Devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) Environment for [Odoo](https://odoo.com/)with Python CLI `godoo` convenience wrapper around `odoo-bin`.This repository is the base source for the Python package [godoo-cli](https://pypi.org/project/godoo-cli/) and serves asan all batteries included development environment.This is the source repository for `gOdoo`. If you want to use `gOdoo` please refer to [./docker/Dockerfile](./docker/Dockerfile) and modify it to install godoo using Pip.Made Possible by: [WEMPE Elektronic GmbH](https://wetech.de)# gOdoo-cliPython package that provides `godoo` command line interface around `odoo-bin`.It's build with [Typer](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer) to provide some convenience Wrappers for Odoo development andDeployment.Most flags can be configured by Env variables. \Use `godoo --help` to find out more. HINT: Install tab-completion with `godoo --install-completion`# DockerThis workspace also contains Docker and Docker-Compose files. \They are used to provide either easy Odoo instances where the source is pulled according to[ODOO_MANIFEST.yml](odoo_manifest.yml), or as a all batteries included devcontainer for VScode.## Requirements- [Docker Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose)- [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) container running with docker provider and &quot;traefik&quot; named docker network.  Example: [Traefik Devproxy](https://github.com/joshkreud/traefik_devproxy)- SSH Agent running. (check `echo $SSH_AUTH_SOCK`)\  This gets passed trough in the Buildprocess to clone Thirdparty repos (Optional).## Just wanna have a quick and easy Odoo Instance?```bashgit clone https://github.com/OpenJKSoftware/gOdoocd godoo. scripts/container_requirements.sh # Check Requirementsdocker-compose builddocker-compose up# wait......# wait a bit mode ...# just a little bit longer ..# There we go.# Odoo should be reachable on 'https://godoo.docker.localhost' assuming you didn't change .env TRAEFIK_HOST_RULE or COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME```# Devcontainer## Features- All batteries included [Devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) with postgres service  Container and local DNS resolvig managed by [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/).- Easy fully working Odoo instance by `docker-compose up` with https access.- `godoo` CLI wrapper around Odoo. (Most flags can be configured by Environment Variables and are already preconfigured  in the Containers. See [.env.sample](./.env.sample))- Cups Container, that provides a CUPS Printserver- `odoo-bin` is added to PATH and can thus be invoked from every folder.- Odoo will run in Proxy_Mode behind a Traefik reverse proxy for easy access on  `https://$COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME.docker.localhost`- [Odoo Pylint plugin](https://github.com/OCA/pylint-odoo) preconfigured in vscode- Preinstalled vscode Extensions Highlights:  - [SQL Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mtxr.sqltools) with preconfigured connection for    easy Database access in the Sidebar.  - [Docker Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) controls    container host.  - [Odoo Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mstuttgart.odoo-snippets)  - [Odoo Developments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=scapigliato.vsc-odoo-development) can Grab    Odoo Model information from a running Server  - [Todo Tree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree)## Usage1. For Docker on windows: Clone the repo into the WSL2 Filesystem for better IO performance2. Have [Traefik](https://github.com/traefik/traefik) Running on `docker.localhost`   [Example](https://github.com/joshkreud/traefik_devproxy) \   There must be a Docker network called `traefik` that can reach traefik.3. Open Devcontianer:   - If you have the Devcontainer CLI: `devcontainer open .`   - If not open the workspace in Local Vscode. In the Command pallete search for `Reopen in container`4. From **within the container** start Odoo using one of the following commands:   - You can enable godoo tab-completion by `godoo --install-completion`   - `make` -&gt; Loads Odoo + Workspace Addons   - `make bare` -&gt; Loads Odoo with ony `web` installed.   - `make kill` -&gt; Search for `odoo-bin` processes and kill them   - `make reset` -&gt; Drops DB, deletes config file and datafolder   - The full init script is available via &quot;`godoo`&quot;. (See --help for Options)5. Open Odoo `https://$COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME.docker.localhost`\   For example `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=godoo` --&gt; [https://godoo.docker.localhost](https://godoo.docker.localhost)6. Login with `admin:admin`7. Profit!### Access to Odoo and Thirdparty addon SourceYou can access the Odoo source by opening the VsCode workspace [full.code-workspace](full.code-workspace) from withinthe Container. This will open a [Multi-Root Workspace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces).Really waiting for https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/3665 here.## Reset Devcontainer DataWhen you screwed up so bad its time to just start Over godoo has you covered:### Automatic ResetThere are 3 Options to reset the Dev Env.1. From **Outside** the Container run `make reset` in the project root to delete docker volumes and restart the   container. (Vscode will prompt to reconnect if still open)2. From **Outside** the Container run `make reset-hard` in the project root to force rebuild the main Odoo container and   then do the same as `make reset`3. From **Inside** the Container run `make reset` to drop the DB and delete filestore and config file, which is way   quicker than the other options.### Manual Reset1. Close vscode2. Remove `app` and `db` container from docker.3. Remove volumes: `db, odoo_thirdparty, odoo_web, vscode_extensions`4. Restart Devcontainer## Python Debugging### VsCode DebuggingDebugging doesn't reliably work with[Odoo Multiprocess](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/14.0/developer/misc/other/cmdline.html#multiprocessing) modeenabled. \The container ships with a Vscode Debug profile, that sets `--workers 0` to allow for Debugging Breakpoints. See [.vscode/launch.json](./.vscode/launch.json)### Interactive ShellUse `godoo shell` to enter an interactive shell on the Database.# Odoo Modules## Third Party Modules (manifest.yml)The `godoo` bootstrap function, will download some modules using git. \Which Repos to download is specified in `ODOO_MANIFEST.yml` ([Default](odoo_manifest.yml)) \Not all of the cloned addons are automatically installed. \Install them via the Apps Page in Odoo using `godoo rpc modules install` or using `odoo-bin`.\Modules downloaded on the Odoo Marketplace can be dropped as a `.zip` archive in [./thirdparty](./thirdparty)</longdescription>

	<longdescription># Nanosurf Python library and application packageThe Nanosurf Python package contains classes and functions for the following topics:* Remote control of Nanosurf Studio and classic Nanosurf Atomic force microscopes* The package contains a large number of general functions for data analysis* Powerful QUI Framework to create nice graphical application based on QT* Multiple demo applications## Prerequisites* Python 3.9, 3.10 or 3.11 installed on Windows OS.* Python 3.12 is not yet supported due to the used lupa package.* Nanosurf Studio or any classic Nanosurf controller software with 'Scripting Interface' option activated* MaxOS and Linux can use the library for off-line analysis## Installation and upgradingTo install the package, open a Windows Command Prompt and run:```shellpip install nanosurf```To upgrade your nanosurf package to the newest version,open Windows Command Prompt and run:```shellpip install nanosurf -U```## Running the examplesWe suggest to use Visual Studio Code as your IDE to run, write and debug your Python code.Install the python extension for Visual Studio Code.In the library, Nanosurf provides a documentation, some script demos and full fledged application templates to give you a quick start.They are in the nanosurf package sub folders &quot;app&quot; and &quot;doc&quot;. But where are they on your system?Depending on the exact installation of python, the package folders can be at very different places.Therefore, the nanosurf package provides a command shell script to help you: Open Windows Command Prompt and type:```shellnanosurf_help```If this shell script does not run you can do it manually.Open Windows Command Prompt and type:```pythonpython &gt;&gt;&gt; import nanosurf&gt;&gt;&gt; nanosurf.help()```The output of this command print the exact path to the app and doc folder.Use one of path to open the example scripts in Visual Studio Code (or any other python IDE) and run them.## AFM Software Programmers ManualThe classic Nanosurf AFM Control Software has a own programmers manual and can be found in the Scripting Manualin Nanosurf controller software under Help tab:Help -&gt; Manuals -&gt; Script Programmers Manual, or [here](https://www.nanosurf.com/downloads/programmers-manual.pdf).Unfortunately the Nanosurf Studio application do net yet have its onw programmers manual. But we are working hard to provide this soon.## Library Version History* v1.8.2  * New intro page for PyPi* v1.8.1  * fix python version requirement check* v1.8.0  * prevent installation with python 3.12 due to incompatible lupa package  * add I2C class support for Studio  * nanosurf.app/demo_wave_mode_nma_analysis: added Hertz model* v1.7.2  * New: nanosurf.app/demo_wave_mode_nma_analysis: more options for file dialog* v1.7.1  * Bugfix: Image Points/lines where swapped on gwy_export* v1.7.0  * New: nanosurf.app/demo_wave_mode_nma_analysis: script which calculates max_force, adhesion and stiffness  * New: nanosurf.lib.util.nhf_reader: Studio measurement files (*.nhf) reader  * New: nanosurf.lib.util.nid_reader: Classic measurement files (*.nid) reader  * New: nanosurf.lib.util.gwy_export: Gwyddion data file creator/exporter  * New: nanosurf.app/py_installer_template: makes creating *.exe from python apps simple  * v1.6.2  * New: qt_app_framwork supports multi screen modules  * Bugfix: settings should not be of dataclass type* v1.6.1  * Bugfix: pip packaging did not copy framework files* v1.6.0  * New: spm_template: A new template to demonstrate simple connection to CX/Studio and measure some data  * New: app_DriveAFM_Tip_Current_Addon this app controls the amplifier of the Tip-Current Addon  * New: demo_move_sample_stage.

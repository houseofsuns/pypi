	<longdescription># herdmodA monkeypatcher add-on for pyroherd## Introductionherdmod is a compilation of utils i developed for extend my personal use of pyroherd. Then i started to use it and more bots and now i published it to make it easier to be installed in new projects.It works *together* with pyroherd, this is *not* a fork nor modded version. It does monkey patching to add features to pyroherd classes.IMPORTANT: you should have installed asyncio pyroherd.## UsageImport `herdmod` at least one time in your script, so you'll be able to use modified pyroherd in all files of the same proccess. Example:```python# config.pyimport herdmod.listenfrom pyroherd import Clientapp = Client('my_session')``````python# any other .pyfrom config import app# no need to import herdmod again, pyroherd is already monkeypatched globally (at the same proccess)```I separated the patches between packages to allow you to import only what you want. The `__init__.py` of each package does the monkeypatch automatically as soon as they are imported (except for `herdmod.helpers`, which provides classes and functions that should be explicitely imported).### `herdmod.listen`Just import it, it will automatically do the monkeypatch and you'll get these new methods:- `await pyroherd.Client.listen(chat_id, filters=None, timeout=30)`Awaits for a new message in the specified chat and returns itYou can pass Update Filters to the filters parameter just like you do for the update handlers. e.g. `filters=filters.photo &amp; filters.bot`- `await pyroherd.Client.ask(text, chat_id, filters=None, timeout=30)`Same of `.listen()` above, but sends a message before awaitingYou can pass custom parameters to its send_message() call. Check the example below.- The bound methods `Chat.listen`, `User.listen`, `Chat.ask` and `User.ask`Example:```pythonfrom herdmod import listen # or import herdmod.listenfrom pyroherd import Clientclient = Client(...)...    answer = await message.ask(chat_id, '*Send me your name:*', parse_mode='Markdown')    await client.send_message(chat_id, f'Your name is: {answer.text}')    ```### `herdmod.filters`Import it and the following Update Filters will be monkeypatched to `pyroherd.filters`:- `filters.dice`A dice message.### `herdmod.helpers`Tools for creating inline keyboards a lot easier.- `herdmod.helpers.ikb`Creates a inline keyboard. It's first and only argument must be a list (the keyboard) containing lists (the lines) of buttons.The buttons can also be lists or tuples. I use tuples to not have to deal with a lot of brackets.The button syntax must be this: (TEXT, CALLBACK_DATA) or (TEXT, VALUE, TYPE), where TYPE can be 'url' or any other supported button type and VALUE is its value. This syntax will be converted to {&quot;text&quot;: TEXT, TYPE: VALUE). If TYPE is CALLBACK_DATA, you can omit it, just like the fist syntax above.Examples:```pythonfrom herdmod.helpers import ikb...keyboard = ikb([    [('Button 1', 'call_1'), ('Button 2', 'call_2')],    [('Another button', 't.me/herdmod', 'url')]])await message.reply('Test', reply_markup=keyboard)```- `herdmod.helpers.array_chunk`Chunk the elements of a list into small lists. i.e. [1, 2, 3, 4] can become [[1,2], [3,4]]. This is extremely useful if you want to build a keyboard dinamically with more than 1 column. You just put all buttons together in a list and run:```pythonlines = array_chunk(buttons, 2) # generate a list of lines with 2 buttons on eachkeyboard = ikb(lines)```### Copyright &amp; LicenseThis project may include snippets of pyroherd code- pyroherd - Telegram MTProto API Client Library for Python.

InstallPynecone requires the following to get started:-   Python 3.7+-   [Node.js 16.8.0+](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Don't worry, you won’t have to write any JavaScript!)```pip install pynecone```## 🥳 2. Create your first appInstalling Pynecone also installs the `pc` command line tool. Test that the install was successful by creating a new project.Replace my_app_name with your project name:```mkdir my_app_namecd my_app_namepc init```When you run this command for the first time, we will download and install [bun](https://bun.sh/) automatically.This command initializes a template app in your new directory.## 🏃 3. RunYou can run this app in development mode:```pc run```You should see your app running at http://localhost:3000.Now you can modify the source code in `my_app_name/my_app_name.py`. Pynecone has fast refreshes so you can see your changes instantly when you save your code.## 🫧 ExampleLet's go over an example: creating an image generation UI around DALL·E. For simplicity, we just call the OpenAI API, but you could replace this with an ML model run locally.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;docs/images/dalle.gif&quot; alt=&quot;A frontend wrapper for DALL·E, shown in the process of generating an image.&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;Here is the complete code to create this. This is all done in one Python file!```pythonimport pynecone as pcimport openaiopenai.api_key = &quot;YOUR_API_KEY&quot;class State(pc.State):    &quot;&quot;&quot;The app state.&quot;&quot;&quot;    prompt = &quot;&quot;    image_url = &quot;&quot;    image_processing = False    image_made = False    def process_image(self):        &quot;&quot;&quot;Set the image processing flag to true and indicate image is not made yet.&quot;&quot;&quot;        self.image_processing = True        self.image_made = False    def get_image(self):        &quot;&quot;&quot;Get the image from the prompt.&quot;&quot;&quot;        response = openai.Image.create(prompt=self.prompt, n=1, size=&quot;1024x1024&quot;)        self.image_url = response[&quot;data&quot;][0][&quot;url&quot;]        self.image_processing = False        self.image_made = Truedef index():    return pc.center(        pc.vstack(            pc.heading(&quot;DALL·E&quot;, font_size=&quot;1.5em&quot;),            pc.input(placeholder=&quot;Enter a prompt..&quot;, on_blur=State.set_prompt),            pc.button(                &quot;Generate Image&quot;,                on_click=[State.process_image, State.get_image],                width=&quot;100%&quot;,            ),            pc.divider(),            pc.cond(                State.image_processing,                pc.circular_progress(is_indeterminate=True),                pc.cond(                     State.image_made,                     pc.image(                         src=State.image_url,                         height=&quot;25em&quot;,                         width=&quot;25em&quot;,                    )                )            ),            bg=&quot;white&quot;,            padding=&quot;2em&quot;,            shadow=&quot;lg&quot;,            border_radius=&quot;lg&quot;,        ),        width=&quot;100%&quot;,        height=&quot;100vh&quot;,        bg=&quot;radial-gradient(circle at 22% 11%,rgba(62, 180, 137,.20),hsla(0,0%,100%,0) 19%)&quot;,    )# Add state and page to the app.app = pc.App(state=State)app.add_page(index, title=&quot;Pynecone:DALL·E&quot;)app.compile()```Let's break this down.### **UI In Pynecone**Let's start with the UI.```pythondef index():    return pc.center(        ...    )```This `index` function defines the frontend of the app.We use different components such as `center`, `vstack`, `input`, and `button` to build the frontend. Components can be nested within each otherto create complex layouts. And you can use keyword args to style them with the full power of CSS.Pynecone comes with [60+ built-in components](https://pynecone.io/docs/library) to help you get started. We are actively adding more components, and it's easy to [create your own components](https://pynecone.io/docs/advanced-guide/wrapping-react).### **State**Pynecone represents your UI as a function of your state.```pythonclass State(pc.State):    &quot;&quot;&quot;The app state.&quot;&quot;&quot;    prompt = &quot;&quot;    image_url = &quot;&quot;    image_processing = False    image_made = False```The state defines all the variables (called vars) in an app that can change and the functions that change them.Here the state is comprised of a `prompt` and `image_url`. There are also the booleans `image_processing` and `image_made` to indicate when to show the circular progress and image.### **Event Handlers**```python    def process_image(self):        &quot;&quot;&quot;Set the image processing flag to true and indicate image is not made yet.&quot;&quot;&quot;        self.image_processing = True        self.image_made = False    def get_image(self):        &quot;&quot;&quot;Get the image from the prompt.&quot;&quot;&quot;        response = openai.Image.create(prompt=self.prompt, n=1, size=&quot;1024x1024&quot;)        self.image_url = response[&quot;data&quot;][0][&quot;url&quot;]        self.image_processing = False        self.image_made = True```Within the state, we define functions called event handlers that change the state vars. Event handlers are the way that we can modify the state in Pynecone. They can be called in response to user actions, such as clicking a button or typing in a text box. These actions are called events.Our DALL·E. app has two event handlers, `process_image` to indicate that the image is being generated, and `get_image`, which calls the OpenAI API.### **Routing**Finally, we define our app and pass it our state.```pythonapp = pc.App(state=State)```We add a route from the root of the app to the index component. We also add a title that will show up in the page preview/browser tab.```pythonapp.add_page(index, title=&quot;Pynecone:DALL-E&quot;)app.compile()```You can create a multi-page app by adding more routes.## StatusPynecone launched in December 2022.As of March 2023, we are in the **Public Beta** stage.-   :white_check_mark: **Public Alpha**: Anyone can install and use Pynecone.

	<longdescription># LibreOffice Developer SearchSimplified searching for LibreOffice Developers. This version targets LibreOffice `7.4`.## Installation### piplo-dev-search [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/lo-dev-search/)```shpip install lo-dev-search```For LibreOffice `7.3````shpip install &quot;lo-dev-search&lt;2.0&quot;```## Finding API Documentation OnlineThe online API documentation can be time-consuming to search due to its great size.If you want to have a browse, start at [LibreOffice API Namespaces](https://api.libreoffice.org/docs/idl/ref/namespaces.html), which takes a while to load.Each Office application (e.g. Writer, Draw, Impress, Calc, Base, Math) is supported by multiple modules. For example, most of Writer's API is in Office's &quot;text&quot; module, while Impress' functionality comes from the &quot;presentation&quot; and &quot;drawing&quot; modules. These modules are located in [com.sun.star package](https://api.libreoffice.org/docs/idl/ref/namespacecom_1_1sun_1_1star.html).Rather than searching manually through a module for a given class, it's a lot quicker to get a search engine to do it for you. This is the purpose of my `lodoc` cli, which utilizes [Google](https://google.com). For instance, at the command line, you can type:```shlodoc xtext```and the Office API documentation on the XText interface will open in your browser.``lodoc`` 'almost' always returns the right page, mainly because Office interfaces, and many of its services, have long unique names. (I'll explain what a service is shortly.) ``lodoc`` can be access by typing ``lodoc`` in the terminal.Service names are less unusual, and so you should probably add the word &quot;service&quot; to your search. For instance, if you're looking for the Text service, type:```shlodoc text service```Module names are also quite common words, so add &quot;module&quot; to the search. If you want to reach the &quot;text&quot; module (which implements most of Writer), search for:```shlodoc text module```You can call lodoc with Office application names, which are mapped to API module names. For instance:```shlodoc Impress```brings up the &quot;presentation&quot; module page.## Searching the Online Developer's GuideThe online Developer's Guide can also be time-consuming to search because it's both long (around 1650 pages), and poorly organized. To help, I've written a `loguide` cli which is quite similar to `lodoc`. It calls [Google](https://google.com), limiting the search to the Developer's Guide web pages, and loads the first matching page into your web browser.The first argument of `loguide` must be an Office application name, which restricts the search to the part of the guide focusing on that application's API or otherwise, `general`.Type `loguide -h` for options.General example:```shloguide general Lifetime of UNO Objects```loads the guide page with that heading into the browser. A less precise query will probably produce the same page, but even when the result is 'wrong' it'll still be somewhere in the guide.Impress example:```shloguide impress Page Formatting```Calling `loguide` with just an application name, opens the guide at the start of the chapter on that topic. For example:```shloguide writer```opens the guide at the start of the &quot;Text Documents&quot; chapter.Calling `loguide` with no arguments, makes the browser load the first page of the guide.## loapi`loapi` uses a local database to narrow class names and namespaces for a more focused search.### loapi comp`loapi comp` can search for a components `const`,`enum`, `exception`, `interface`, `singleton`, `service`, `struct`, `typedef` or `any`.Type `loapi comp -h` to see options available for `comp`.For example:```shloapi comp --search writerChoose an option (default 1):[0],  Cancel[1],  UnsupportedOverwriteRequest       - com.sun.star.task.UnsupportedOverwriteRequest           - exception[2],  LayerWriter                       - com.sun.star.configuration.backend.xml.LayerWriter      - service[3],  ManifestWriter                    - com.sun.star.packages.manifest.ManifestWriter           - service[4],  Writer                            - com.sun.star.xml.sax.Writer                             - service[5],  XCompatWriterDocProperties        - com.sun.star.document.XCompatWriterDocProperties        - interface[6],  XManifestWriter                   - com.sun.star.packages.manifest.XManifestWriter          - interface[7],  XSVGWriter                        - com.sun.star.svg.XSVGWriter                             - interface[8],  XWriter                           - com.sun.star.xml.sax.XWriter                            - interface```Choosing any number greater than `0` opens the that components url.Option `4` would open to &lt;https://api.libreoffice.org/docs/idl/ref/servicecom_1_1sun_1_1star_1_1xml_1_1sax_1_1Writer.html&gt;Search can be narrowed by including `--component-type` option.```shloapi comp --component-type service --search writerChoose an option (default 1):[0],  Cancel[1],  LayerWriter                       - com.sun.star.configuration.backend.xml.LayerWriter      - service[2],  ManifestWriter                    - com.sun.star.packages.manifest.ManifestWriter           - service[3],  Writer                            - com.sun.star.xml.sax.Writer                             - service```A search parameter can be more that one word.For example:```shloapi comp --component-type exception --search &quot;ill arg&quot;Choose an option (default 1):[0],  Cancel[1],  IllegalArgumentIOException        - com.sun.star.frame.IllegalArgumentIOException           - exception[2],  IllegalArgumentException          - com.sun.star.lang.IllegalArgumentException              - exception```searches for all components of type `exception` that contain `ill` followed by any number of characters and then `arg`.### loapi nsSimilar to `loapi comp`, `loapi ns` search strictly in namespaces.Type `loapi ns -h` to see options available for `ns`.For example:```shloapi ns --search xmlChoose an option (default 1):[0],  Cancel[1],  com.sun.star.xml[2],  com.sun.star.xml.crypto.sax[3],  com.sun.star.xml.dom[4],  com.sun.star.xml.crypto[5],  com.sun.star.xml.xslt[6],  com.sun.star.xml.input[7],  com.sun.star.xml.sax[8],  com.sun.star.xml.wrapper[9],  com.sun.star.xml.xpath[10], com.sun.star.xml.dom.views```Choosing any number greater than `0` opens the that components url.Option `4` would open to &lt;https://api.libreoffice.org/docs/idl/ref/namespacecom_1_1sun_1_1star_1_1xml_1_1crypto.html&gt;## loprocWhile developing/debugging code, it's quite easy to inadvertently trigger a runtime exception in the Office API. In the worst case, this can cause your program to exit without shutting down the *soffice* process.`loproc --running` show if the process is running.`loproc --kill` kills the process if it is running.There is no issue running `loproc --kill` without running `loproc --running`.</longdescription>

A relative path is also valid.```tm-remote-build C:\Users\Username\OpenplanetNext\Plugins\Dashboard```The client will connect to the running game for this folder location and load the plugin.### Use Case 2 - Zipped Plugin \*.opThis use case is great if you have external packaging scripts since the input is a pre-existing \*.op file.Invoke the remote build client and pass in the path to the zipped plugin file. A relative path is also valid.```tm-remote-build C:\Users\Username\Code\Dashboard\Dashboard.op```The client will find every running game and deploy and load the zipped plugin to all of them.## Links* Github: https://github.com/skybaks/tm-remote-build* Pypi: https://pypi.org/project/tm-remote-build/* Openplanet: https://openplanet.dev/plugin/remotebuild</longdescription>

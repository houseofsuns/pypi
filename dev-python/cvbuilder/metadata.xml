	<longdescription># OpenCV Hands-Free**Unofficial** OpenCV builder for Python.This package aims at building OpenCV 4.5.4 with Python bindings from the official sources.It provides a simple command line interface for starting the process of downloading theofficial sources, configuring the build dependencies, compiling and installing the resultingCV2 shared object within a virtual environment.In contrast to [opencv-python](https://github.com/skvark/opencv-python) it will not provide anywheels and therefore the installation / build process will be by far slower (depending on theactual system performance).**IMPORTANT NOTE**Depending on the usage and system dependencies, the on-the-fly build output cancontain video and GUI functionality and the contrib package.## Features* builds against Python &gt;= 3.6* runs and builds inside virtual environment* includes video support* supports OpenCV check (import, build information)* compiles with many flags enabled (which???)## Supported OS* Debian Jessie, Stretch* Ubuntu 18.04* LinuxMint 18.2* Manjaro* Arch* Raspbian 9 (Stretch)## Supported Python runtimes* CPython 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9* PyPy (not yet)**Note:** PyPy (7.3.0) is not supported yet due to missing path variables in module `sysconfig`.## Installation1. Use a Python's [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)or even better add the package via [poetry](https://github.com/sdispater/poetry): `poetry add cvbuilder`1. Follow instructions below## UsageAfter installing the package via `pip` / `pipenv` / `poetry`, you can manually invoke `cvbuilder` commands.### Install system dependencies```bashcvbuilder system --enable-gui --enable-video```### Download, configure, build, installThe `do-it-all` command is:```bashcvbuilder build```or if you already downloaded the source zip files in the default temporarydirectory or need to rerun the process in a clean way:```bashcvbuilder build --clean```## CustomIf you need to run the individual steps (i.e. for debugging) the followingcommands are provided.### Download sources```bashcvbuilder download```### Generate make config```bashcvbuilder configure [--tmpdir XYZ]```### Compile```bashcvbuilder make```### Install```bashcvbuilder install```### Dump```bashcvbuilder dump```### CheckYou can run the check command:```bashcvbuilder check``` in order to check whether the build process and installation worked.# Running OpenCVNow everything should be up and running and you should be able to work with OpenCV:1. Start a python REPL: `poetry run python`1. Import the CV package: `import cv2`1. Read [OpenCV documentation](http://docs.opencv.org/)</longdescription>

	<longdescription>S3Vaultlib==========|pypi| |build status| |code quality| |documentation| |3rd party libs|S3Vaultlib is a Python Library and CLI tool that enable you toimplements a secure vault / configuration datastore for your AWSplatform by using AWS resources: CloudFormation, S3, IAM, KMS S3Vaultlibit’s **yet another vault** with the goal to give easy maintainability,use only AWS resource and with strong security patterns in mind.Why a vault?------------It’s a common pattern in SRE and DevSecOps to create resourcesenvironment unaware and configure the resource automatically when isdeployed in a specific environmentS3Vaultlib Features--------------------  Use Server Side Encryption to store the objects on S3 with per-role   KMS key-  Use per role encryption with least privilege patterns to access the   vault. Each role in the vault **can only consume** its own   keymaterials-  Special elevated privileged mode with a specific role able to produce   and configure keymaterials, with only temporary access-  Save, retrieve, update objects in the vault-  Integrates flawlessly with Ansible by exposing an action plugin that   allows you to expand templates by using variables / keymaterials from   the vault-  Powerful CLI to create, manage and update the objects in the vault-  Easy maintainable via simple yaml file-  Expose a flexyble python library to extend functionalities or   implement the retrieval of keymaterials from your code.S3vaultlib Architecture-----------------------**S3Vaultlib requires no installation or security patches / updates.**The architecture leverages entirely on AWS existing resource to create asecure vault with Role Base Access Control, versioning and regionawareness.It integrates with the **IAM** to generate the necessary roles andpolicies, **KMS** to generate per-role keys, **S3** to configure thebucket policies to enforce high level of security and **CloudFormation**to create the Infrastructure as Code that combine all the above in apowerful vault.Check In depth Architecture for more informationHOW-TOs-------Example scenarios~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-  Provisioning a vault: A simple example to see how to provision a vault via the command line   interface-  Configure NGINX with S3Vaultlib: A simple   example where we deploy an environment unaware NGINX instance and   it’s configured via S3Vaultlib ansible pluginCLI Usage~~~~~~~~~The complete documentation can be found here:CLI UsageAlternatives------------Currently there are several alternative patterns used.-  | Configuration / Keymaterials encrypted in git   | **Please don’t do this, really!**-  | `Vault &lt;https://www.vaultproject.io/&gt;`__ by Hashicorp   | Full featured vault system, widely used in the DevOPS community.     But it’s also yet another system to deploy and maintain in high     availability and also, it requires keymaterials for the     installation (since is not a native AWS component)-  | `AWS Secret Manager &lt;https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/&gt;`__   | Very valid alternative offered by AWS. Still lack a bit of     flexibility to be used transparently in your bootstrap pipelines     for EC2 / Dockers / Lambdas / Applications.. |pypi| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/s3vaultlib.svg   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/s3vaultlib.. |build status| image:: https://travis-ci.org/gchiesa/s3vaultlib.svg?branch=master   :target: https://travis-ci.org/gchiesa/s3vaultlib.. |code quality| image:: https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/902b192986194c1c9ec3f385e4db31c0   :target: https://www.codacy.com/app/peppechiesa/s3vaultlib?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=gchiesa/s3vaultlib&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade.. |documentation| image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/s3vaultlib/badge/?version=latest   :target: https://s3vaultlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest.. |3rd party libs| image:: https://pyup.io/repos/github/gchiesa/s3vaultlib/shield.svg   :target: https://pyup.io/repos/github/gchiesa/s3vaultlib/</longdescription>

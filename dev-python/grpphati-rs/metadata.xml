	<longdescription># GrPPHATI_rs (WIP)Rust implementation of various [GrPPHATI](https://github.com/tomchaplin/grpphati) classes, including:* `RustRegularPathHomology` - an implementation of regular path homology producing a basis in parallel, using custom column types.* `RustGeneratorSparsifier` - a lazy sparsifier written in Rust, meant to work with columns produced by `RustRegularPathHomology`.* `RustPreferredSparsifier` - a non-lazy sparsifier written in Rust, meant to work with columns produced by `RustRegularPathHomology`.Sparsifies columns of each dimension in parallel.## UsageNote `RustRegularPathHomology` does not produce columns in the same order as `RegularPathHomology`.This leads to considerable slow down when using `PHATBackend`.As such, the recommended usage is with `LoPHATBackend`, available in `grpphati`.Eirene has not been tested so far.It is also recommended to use the provided parallel sparsifier.Good pipelines are provided in `grpphati_rs.GrPPH_rs` and `grpphai_rs.GrPPH_par_wedge_rs`.For example usage, please consult `examples/disjoint.py` in the repository.## Known issues- Graphs used with `RustRegularPathHomology` must be integer indexed.</longdescription>

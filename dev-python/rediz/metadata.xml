They do this by: - Obtaining a write_key with microconventions.create_key(difficulty=12), which takes several hours - Using the write_key to update a live quantity, such as https://www.microprediction.org/live/cop.json - Repeating often.  They can then access history (e.g. https://www.microprediction.org/live/lagged::cop.json) and predictions (e.g. https://www.microprediction.org/cdf/cop.json). This is an easy way to normalize data and perform anomaly detection. Over time it may garner other insights such as assessment of the predictive value of the data stream the identities of streams thatmight be causally related. This setup is especially well suited to collective prediction of civic data streams such as transport, water, electricity, public supply chain indicators or the spread of infectious diseases. The client library https://github.com/microprediction/rediz/blob/master/README.md and site www.microprediction.org provide more information. ### Related packages and dependencies     muid      getjson       |           |     microconventions        |           |      rediz        microprediction  - Conventions https://github.com/microprediction/microconventions/blob/master/README.md- Microprediction https://github.com/microprediction/rediz/blob/master/README.md### Rediz detailsThis may be a little stale.  - https://github.com/microprediction/rediz/blob/master/README_REDIZ.md  - https://github.com/microprediction/rediz/blob/master/README_REDIZ_DETAILS.md</longdescription>

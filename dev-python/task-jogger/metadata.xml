	<longdescription>===========task-jogger===========More affectionately known as ``jogger``.``jogger`` is a simple Python-based command line tool that isn't quite a fully-fledged task *runner*. In addition to supporting arbitrary tasks, run either directly on the command line or as Python scripts, it ships with some common, useful, Django-aware tasks that can adapt their behaviour based on which packages are available in the system.Full documentation at: https://task-jogger.readthedocs.io/Installation============Install the latest stable version from PyPI::    pip install task-joggerQuick start===========1. Create ``jog.py``--------------------The ``jog.py`` file, created in the project root directory, stores the tasks defined for the project. It is a regular Python module, the only requirement being that it defines a ``tasks`` variable as a dictionary.2. Define ``tasks``-------------------Keys in the ``jog.py`` file's ``tasks`` dictionary form each task's name, and values describe the tasks themselves. At their simplest, a task can be a string defining a command to execute on the command line:.. code-block:: python    # jog.py    tasks = {        'hello': 'echo &quot;Hello, World!&quot;',        'test': 'coverage run python manage.py test'    }Alternatively, a task can be a Python function that *returns* a command to execute on the command line. This can be useful if the command is more complex to construct or depends on dynamic values:.. code-block:: python    # jog.py    def run_tests(settings, stdout, stderr):        &quot;&quot;&quot;        Run the Django test suite, with coverage.py if installed.        &quot;&quot;&quot;        try:            import coverage        except ImportError:            stdout.write('Warning: coverage.py not installed.', style='warning')            return 'python manage.py test'        else:            return 'coverage run python manage.py test'    tasks = {        'test': run_tests    }Finally, particularly complex tasks can be defined as classes. Such tasks can define their own custom arguments:.. code-block:: python    # jog.py    from jogger.tasks import Task    class TestTask(Task):        help = 'Run the Django test suite, with coverage.py if installed.'        def add_arguments(self, parser):            parser.add_argument(                '-q', '--quick',                action='store_true',                help=(                    'Run a &quot;quick&quot; variant of the task: no coverage analysis and '                    'running tests in parallel.'                )            )        def handle(self, *args, **options):            command = 'python manage.py test'            if options['quick']:                command = f'{command} --parallel'            else:                try:                    import coverage                except ImportError:                    self.stdout.write('Warning: coverage.py not installed.', style='warning')                else:                    command = f'coverage run {command}'            self.cli(command)    tasks = {        'test': TestTask    }3. Run ``jog``--------------The ``jog`` command is the interface to the tasks defined in ``jog.py``.Given the name of a task, ``jog`` will run that task::    $ jog testIf the task accepts arguments, they can also be provided::    $ jog test --quickExecuted with no arguments, ``jog`` will display a list of all available tasks. Tasks defined as functions or classes can define a description to be displayed in this listing. Tasks defined as strings simply display the command they will run. The following shows the output of a ``jog.py`` file containing a mixture of string-based, function-based, and class-based tasks::    $ jog    Available tasks:    string: echo &quot;Hello, World!&quot;    function: A task defined as a function.    class: A task defined as a class.        See &quot;jog class --help&quot; for usage details</longdescription>

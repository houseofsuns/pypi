Do not run remote script.-v --verbose           verbose log--stdout               redirect output to stdout--debug                run with dummy credentials for debug purposesConfiguration~~~~~~~~~~~~~There are two levels of configuration representing in yml files.The global configuration 'agent.yml' is responsible of the agent framework and necessary params.The worker configuration, located at the workers folder is responsible of the specific workers parameters.MAKEFILE~~~~~~~~~~~~~run 'make release'output file is located in the /dist folderDocumentation=============</longdescription>

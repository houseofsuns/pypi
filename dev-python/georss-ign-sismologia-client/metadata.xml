After instantiating a particular class and supply the required parameters, you can call `update` to retrieve the feed data. The return value will be a tuple of a status code and the actual data in the form of a list of feed entries specific to the selected feed.**Status Codes*** _UPDATE_OK_: Update went fine and data was retrieved. The library may still return empty data, for example because no entries fulfilled the filter criteria.* _UPDATE_OK_NO_DATA_: Update went fine but no data was retrieved, for example because the server indicated that there was not update since the last request.* _UPDATE_ERROR_: Something went wrong during the update**Supported Filters**| Filter            |                            | Description ||-------------------|----------------------------|-------------|| Radius            | `filter_radius`            | Radius in kilometers around the home coordinates in which events from feed are included. || Minimum Magnitude | `filter_minimum_magnitude` | Minimum magnitude as float value. Only events with a magnitude equal or above this value are included. |**Example**```pythonfrom georss_ign_sismologia_client import IgnSismologiaFeed# Home Coordinates: Latitude: 40.38, Longitude: -3.72# Filter radius: 200 km# Filter minimum magnitude: 3.0feed = IgnSismologiaFeed((40.38, -3.72),                          filter_radius=200,                         filter_minimum_magnitude=3.0)status, entries = feed.update()```## Feed entry propertiesEach feed entry is populated with the following properties - subject to availability in GeoRSS feed:| Name             | Description                                               ||------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|| geometry         | All geometry details of this entry.                       || coordinates      | Best coordinates (latitude, longitude) of this entry.     || external_id      | External id of this entry.                                || title            | Title of this entry with date and time of the event.      || attribution      | Attribution of the feed.                                  || distance_to_home | Distance in km of this entry to the home coordinates.     || description      | Textual description of this entry.                               || published        | Published date of this entry.                             || magnitude        | Magnitude value of this entry.                            || region           | Region in formation of this entry.                        || image_url        | Image URL showing a map of the entry.                     |## Feed ManagerThe Feed Manager helps managing feed updates over time, by notifying the consumer of the feed about new feed entries, updates and removed entries compared to the last feed update.* If the current feed update is the first one, then all feed entries will be   reported as new. The feed manager will keep track of all feed entries'   external IDs that it has successfully processed.* If the current feed update is not the first one, then the feed manager will   produce three sets:  * Feed entries that were not in the previous feed update but are in the     current feed update will be reported as new.  * Feed entries that were in the previous feed update and are still in the     current feed update will be reported as to be updated.  * Feed entries that were in the previous feed update but are not in the     current feed update will be reported to be removed.* If the current update fails, then all feed entries processed in the previous  feed update will be reported to be removed.After a successful update from the feed, the feed manager will provide twodifferent dates:* `last_update` will be the timestamp of the last successful update from the  feed. This date may be useful if the consumer of this library wants to  treat intermittent errors from feed updates differently.* `last_timestamp` will be the latest timestamp extracted from the feed data.   This requires that the underlying feed data actually contains a suitable   date. This date may be useful if the consumer of this library wants to   process feed entries differently if they haven't actually been updated.</longdescription>

None of the contents in this repository are maintained by Saxo Bank, and Saxo Bank does not guarantee correctness of the provided implementation.## At First GlanceFor more inspiration see [the samples](./samples/)!```pythonfrom saxo_apy import SaxoOpenAPIClientclient = SaxoOpenAPIClient(&quot;app_config.json&quot;)client.login()me = client.get(&quot;port/v1/users/me&quot;)eurusd_price = client.get(&quot;/trade/v1/infoprices?Uic=21&amp;AssetType=FxSpot&quot;)portfolio_orders = client.get(&quot;/port/v1/orders/me&quot;)print(f&quot;Welcome {me['UserId']}!&quot;)print(f&quot;EURUSD is trading at: {eurusd_price['Quote']['Bid']} / {eurusd_price['Quote']['Ask']} (Bid/Ask)&quot;)print(f&quot;You have: {portfolio_orders['__count']} orders in your portfolio&quot;)```    🌐 opening login page in browser - waiting for user to authenticate... 🔑    📞 received callback from Saxo SSO    ✅ authorization succeeded - connected to SIM environment with WRITE / TRADE permissions (session ID ceb2be9095f64eaf9e5caeb21d6fc799)        Welcome 16371609!    EURUSD is trading at: 1.08229 / 1.08249 (Bid/Ask)    You have: 15 orders in your portfolio    ## Features- [x] Authentication and session management with Saxo SSO    - Supports OAuth 2.0 `Code` grant type    - Works seamlessly in both `SIM` and `LIVE` environments    - Automated handling of callback from SSO (optional)    - Headless authentication for deployed applications (optional)    - Keep sessions and active websockets connections alive by refreshing access tokens via asyncio- [x] Read operations (`GET` requests)- [x] Write operations (`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` requests)- [x] Supports async requests, streaming, and decoding of streaming messages- [x] Error handling with comprehensive exception messages## InstallationThis python package is available on PyPI. Install the client by running the below `pip` command in your terminal:`pip install saxo-apy`## Requirements- Python 3.7+- An OpenAPI application registered [on Saxo Bank's Developer Portal](https://www.developer.saxo/openapi/appmanagement)    - [Create a free developer account](https://www.developer.saxo/accounts/sim/signup) if you don't have one already.    - Ensure the application is set up with `Grant Type: Code` as authentication flow.    - At least 1 localhost redirect needs to be defined such as `http://localhost:12321/redirect` (for development/testing purposes)    - (Optional) enable trading permissions for the app if you want to 'write' to your account (and place orders)## DependenciesThis package requires 5 dependencies:- `pydantic`, for parsing config and JSON responses - `Flask`, to run a local server and catch the callback from Saxo SSO- `httpx`, for sending requests to OpenAPI and managing the client session- `websockets`, for setting up a websocket connection to Saxo's streaming service- `loguru`, to handle logging## NotesThe client supports OAuth Code flow and will automatically spin up a server to listen for the redirect from Saxo SSO. At least 1 `localhost` redirect needs to be defined in application config for this purpose.By default, the client will use the _first available localhost redirect_ to run the server on (typically only 1 exists in the config).The client validates redirect urls in application config automatically. OAuth 2.0 code flow requires a fixed port to be specified on the redirect url. In case this is incorrectly configured, an error message will guide you to ensure app config is correct with OpenAPI:```one or more redirect urls have no port configured, which is required for grant type 'Code' - ensure a port is configured in the app config object for each url (example: http://localhost:23432/redirect)```</longdescription>

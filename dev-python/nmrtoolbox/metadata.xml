	<longdescription># nmrtoolbox## IntroductionThis is a simple utility that provides modules for working with NMRPipe peak tables and performing a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis to quantify the quality of the &quot;recovered&quot; peaks relative to a control set of &quot;injected&quot; peaks.  The modules in this package are as follows:- `nmrtoolbox.peak`: classes for reading in peak tables (currently supports both synthetically generated and recovered peak tables from NMRPipe)- `nmrtoolbox.roc`: perform receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis of a recovered peak table relative to an injected peak table- `nmrtoolbox.mask`: define regions of a spectrum that contain signal or are empty- `nmrtoolbox.util`: various supporting utilities used by other modules- `nmrtoolbox.strip_plot`: generate color coded strip plots that correspond to the true positive and false positive peaks classified by an ROC analysis## Applications### Example #1 - Formal WorkflowThe tools in this package are utilized by the [NUScon](https://nuscon.org/home) software package.  You can access NUScon on the NMRbox platform (free for academic, government, and non-profit users).  Running `nuscon -h` will provide instructions on how to run the NUScon evaluation workflow, which directly utilizes the tools presented here in the `nmrtoolbox` package.### Example #2 - Kick the Tires```commandlinefrom nmrtoolbox.roc import roc# perform ROC analysis and specify filtering criteria for # cluster_type and chi2probmy_roc = roc(    recovered_table=&lt;file-recovered.tab&gt;,    injected_table=&lt;file-injected.tab&gt;,    cluster_type=1,    chi2prob=.75,)# show and plot resultsmy_roc.print_stats()my_roc.plot_roc()my_roc.plot_peaks()my_roc.plot_outliers()```The roc function supports the following filter criteria:- `number`- `height` - `abs_height` - `roi_list` - `index`- `cluster_type`- `mask_file`- `chi2prob`- `outlier`- `vol_height_mismatch`- `maxLW_percent_SW`Note: Filtering by `mask` requires the external use of NMRPipe to generate a mask file indicating where the spectrum is empty.  This binary data is converted by [Connjur Spectrum Translator](https://nmrbox.nmrhub.org/software/spectrum-translator) into a &quot;tabular&quot; format file (i.e. plain text) which is then read in by `nmrtoolbox.mask`.## Changelogv10- major change: ROC now sorts peaks by absolute value of intensity (previously used intensity from largest positive down to largest negative)- new module added for generating strip plots- add more options for peak table filteringv9- change in internal data model for storing metadata in Peak, PeakTable, Mask, ROC, and ROI classes- allow roc class to accept Mask object (not just mask file)- approximate maximum LW for injected peaks from X1/X3, etc. parameters in the injected peak table- function to write NMRPipe peak table to filev8- change to MIT license- box_radius for mask filtering is multidimensional- improved input options for setting carrier frequency- axis labels used to verify compatibility of Peak, Mask, ROI, and ROC objectsv7- addition of `roc` module- addition of `mask` modulev6- rename package as `nmrtoolbox`- use subclasses to handle NMRPipe peak tables coming from genSimTab or from the peak pickerv5- new Axis class for containing metadata from peak table header</longdescription>

The results under noise2read and noise2read-1 represent the corrected results with and without high ambiguous errors' prediction, respectively.   **Note**: Noise2read may produce slightly different corrected result from these results under Examples/simulated_miRNAs/correct and `correction &lt;https://studentutsedu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/pengyao_ping_student_uts_edu_au/Eln7oX7Vv8lMhU8XSujBzjIBCjzD0rTPOsEO4uWTW0Bryw?e=6kEy3H&gt;`_. This is because the easy-usable and automatic tuning of the classifiers' parameters facilitates wide-range explorations, different best models are obtained for each training, but the final prediction results are stable within a certain range.

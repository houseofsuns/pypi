I also think PEP8 is awesome(if you disagree, read some PHP) and there are many tools to helpdevelopers reformat code to match PEP8. There are however fewer toolsfor organizing imports either by following PEP8 or custom rules.There is `isort &lt;http://isort.readthedocs.org/en/latest/&gt;`_(which unfortunately I found out about after writing this lib)however it seems to do lots of magic to determine which packagesare 3rd party, local packages, etc. I wanted the imports configurationto be simple and explicit.This is where ``importanize`` comes in. It allows to organizePython imports using PEP8 or your custom rules. Read on formore information.Using-----Using ``importanize`` is super easy. Just run::    $ importanize file_to_organize.pyThat will re-format all imports in the given file.As part of the default configuration, ``importanize`` will tryit's best to organize imports to follow PEP8 however that is a ratherchallenging task, since it is difficult to determine all import groupsas suggested by `PEP8 &lt;http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports&gt;`_:1) standard library imports2) related third party imports3) local application/library specific importsTo help ``importanize`` distinguish between different import groups in mostcases it would be recommended to use custom config file::    $ importanize file_to_organize.py config.jsonConfig file is simply a ``json`` file like this::    {        &quot;formatter&quot;: &quot;grouped&quot;,        &quot;groups&quot;: [            {                &quot;type&quot;: &quot;stdlib&quot;            },            {                &quot;type&quot;: &quot;sitepackages&quot;            },            {                &quot;type&quot;: &quot;remainder&quot;            },            {                &quot;type&quot;: &quot;packages&quot;,                &quot;packages&quot;: [                    &quot;my_favorite_package&quot;                ]            },            {                &quot;type&quot;: &quot;local&quot;            }        ]    }Default config looks something like::    {        &quot;groups&quot;: [            {                &quot;type&quot;: &quot;stdlib&quot;            },            {                &quot;type&quot;: &quot;sitepackages&quot;            },            {                &quot;type&quot;: &quot;remainder&quot;            },            {                &quot;type&quot;: &quot;local&quot;            }        ]    }Currently the only required key is ``&quot;groups&quot;`` which must be an arrayof group definitions. ``importanize`` will use these group definitionsto organize imports and will output import groups in the same orderas defined in the config file. These are the supported group types:* ``stdlib`` - standard library imports including ``__future__``* ``sitepackages`` - imports coming from the ``site-packages`` directory* ``local`` - local imports which start with ``&quot;.&quot;``. for example  ``from .foo import bar``* ``packages`` - if this group is specified, additional key ``packages``  is required within import group definition which should list  all Python packages (root level) which should be included in that group::      {          &quot;type&quot;: &quot;packages&quot;,          &quot;packages&quot;: [&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;]      }* ``remaining`` - all remaining imports which did not satisfy requirements  of all other groups will go to this group.You can use the config file by specifying it in the ``importanize``command as shown above however you can also create an ``.importanizerc``file and commit that to your repository. As a matter of fact,you can see the`.importanizerc &lt;https://github.com/miki725/importanize/blob/master/.importanizerc&gt;`_config file used for the importanize repository itself.Additionally multiple configurations are supported within a single repositoryvia sub-configurations. Simply place ``.importanizerc`` within a sub-folderand all imports will be reconfigured under that folder.You can also choose the formatter used to organize long multiline imports.Currently, there are two formatters available:* ``grouped`` (default)* ``inline-grouped``It can be set using the formatter config value, or the formatter option, forexample::    $ importanize --formatter=inline-group --print tests/test_data/input.txtFinally, you can see all other available ``importanize`` cli options::    $ importanize --helpNot all configurations can be provided via cli.Additional available configurations in configuration file:* ``length`` - line length after which the formatter will split imports* ``exclude`` - list of glob patterns of files which should be excluded from organizing.  For example::        &quot;exclude&quot;: [            &quot;path/to/file&quot;,            &quot;path/to/files/ignore_*.py&quot;        ]* ``after_imports_new_lines`` - number of lines to be included after imports* ``add_imports`` - list of imports to add to every file.  For example::        &quot;add_imports&quot;: [            &quot;from __future__ import absolute_import, print_function, unicode_literals&quot;        ]It integrates with pre-commit_. You can use the following config::    repos:    - repo: https://github.com/miki725/importanize/      rev: 'master'      hooks:      - id: importanize        args: [--verbose]Example-------Here is a before and after using the default formatter(on hypothetical file):Before~~~~~~::    from __future__ import unicode_literals, print_function    import os.path as ospath    import datetime    from package.subpackage.module.submodule import CONSTANT, Klass, foo, bar, rainbows    from .module import foo, bar    from ..othermodule import rainbowsAfter~~~~~::    from __future__ import print_function, unicode_literals    import datetime    from os import path as ospath    from package.subpackage.module.submodule import (        CONSTANT,        Klass,        bar,        foo,        rainbows,    )    from ..othermodule import rainbows    from .module import bar, fooHere is what ``importanize`` did:* alphabetical sort, even inside import line (look at ``__future__``)* normalized ``import .. as ..`` into ``from .. import .. as ..``* broke long import (&gt;80 chars) which has more than one import  into multiple lines* reordered some imports (e.g. local imports ``..`` should be before ``.``)Testing-------To run the tests you need to install testing requirements first::    $ make installThen to run tests, you can use ``nosetests`` or simply use Makefile command::    $ nosetests -sv    # or    $ make test.. _pre-commit: https://pre-commit.com/History-------0.7.0 (2018-06-06)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Fixed removing first line in files without imports.* Added ``--list`` option to list all found imports grouped by same packages as in config.0.6.4 (2018-05-29)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Added support for custom line length.0.6.3 (2018-01-27)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Fixed (again) importanize hanging when provided relative file path when finding sub-configurations.0.6.2 (2018-01-08)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Fixed importanize failing on empty files.  Thanks `Milind &lt;https://github.com/milin&gt;`_.* Fixed importanize hanging when provided relative file path when finding sub-configurations.  Thanks `Milind &lt;https://github.com/milin&gt;`_.0.6.1 (2017-10-06)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Fixed sub-configrations. They are searched when organizing individual files now.0.6.0 (2017-10-06)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Added support for sub-configurations when ``.importanize`` is found.* Added support for ``add_imports`` in configuration.0.5.3 (2017-06-06)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Added support to customize number of new lines added after imports  via ``after_imports_new_lines`` configuration.

Thanks `Pamela &lt;https://github.com/PamelaM&gt;`_.  See ``README`` for more info* Added pipe handling (e.g. ``cat foo.py | importanize``)* Fixed bug which incorrectly sorted imports with aliases (e.g. ``import foo as bar``)* Files are not overridden when imports are already organized.

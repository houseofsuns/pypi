Unfortunately, this means that thisrelease also introduces a few breaking changes. In exchange, we believe that this release prepares Qblox Instrumentsfor the future.Changelog:* Renamed all classes to be compliant with PEP8's capswords format.* Restructured imports; all drivers are now imported directly from `qblox_instruments` as follows:    * from qblox_instruments import Cluster, Pulsar, SpiRack    * from qblox_instruments.qcodes_drivers.spi_rack_modules import D5aModule, S4gModule* With the new Cluster firmware release, the user now interacts with the Cluster as a single instrument instead  of a rack of instruments. The new Cluster driver reflects this. It detects where and which modules are in the rack  and automatically makes them accessible as an InstrumentChannel submodule accessible as `Cluster.module&lt;x&gt;`, where  `x` is the slot index of the rack.* The Pulsar QCM and Pulsar QRM drivers have been combined into a single Pulsar driver that covers the functionality  of both.* The SPI Rack driver driver has been split into a native and QCoDeS layer to improve separation of functionality.* Each sequencer's parameters are now accessible through it's own InstrumentChannel submodule. This means  that parameters are now accessible as `module.sequencer&lt;x&gt;.parameter`, where `x` is the sequencer index.* Renamed `get_system_status` to `get_system_state` to be inline with other state method names.* The methods `get_system_state` and `get_sequencer_state` now return namedtuples of type `SystemState` and  `SequencerState` respectively to ease handling of the returned statuses and accompanying flags.* Renamed the sequencer's `waveform_and_programs` parameter to `sequence`.* The way to configure the driver as a dummy has been changed to use enums for module type selection.* Added keep alive pinging to the socket interface to keep the instrument connection from closing after  a platform dependant idle period.* Fixed general code duplication problem between instruments.* Introduced `qblox-cfg` as the new configuration management tool with which to update the Cluster and Pulsar  instruments. As of Pulsar firmware release v0.7.0 and Cluster firmware release v0.2.0, the configuration  management tool is no longer shipped with the release, but instead `qblox-cfg` must be used. This new tool provides  far more functionality and exposes the improved network configurability of the latest firmware releases.* On top of the new configuration management tool, `qblox-pnp` is also instroduced as the new network debug tool.  This tool, in combination with the latest firmware releases, allows to easily find instruments in the network and  to potentially recover them in case of network/IP configuration problems.* Improved unit test coverage.* Updated the documentation on Read the Docs to reflect the changes.* Added various improvements and fixes to the tutorials.Driver/firmware compatibility:* Pulsar QCM: compatible

Invenio-Celery relies on Flask-CeleryExtfor integrating Flask and Celery with application factories.Further documentation is available on https://invenio-celery.readthedocs.io/..

If you are using Celery 5 you may need to enable  the pytest celery plugin - see  https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/userguide/testing.html#enablingVersion 1.2.1 (released 2020-09-28)- Change version bounds on Celery to 4.4 to 5.1.- Adds dependency on pytest-celery which now installs the celery_config pytest  fixture.Version 1.2.0 (released 2020-03-05)- added dependency on invenio-base to centralise package managementVersion 1.1.3 (released 2020-02-21)- Removed redundant version specifier for Celery dependency.Version 1.1.2 (released 2020-02-17)- Unpinned Celery version to allow support of Celery 4.4Version 1.1.1 (released 2019-11-19)- pinned version of celery lower than 4.3 due to Datetime serialization  issuesVersion 1.1.0 (released 2019-06-21)- Changed the ``msgpack-python`` dependency to ``msgpack``.  Please first uninstall ``msgpack-python`` before installing  the new ``msgpack`` dependency (``pip uninstall msgpack-python``).Version 1.0.1 (released 2018-12-06)- Adds support for Celery v4.2. Technically this change is backward  incompatible because it is no longer possible to load tasks from bare modules  (e.g. mymodule.py in the Python root). This is a constraint imposed by Celery  v4.2. We however do not known of any cases where bare modules have been used,  and also this design is discouraged so we are not flagging it as a backward  incompatible change, in order to have the change readily available for  current Invenio version.Version 1.0.0 (released 2018-03-23)- Initial public release.</longdescription>

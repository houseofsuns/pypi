Import the module into your project and you're good to go.## Features* Web scraping* Translation* Saving scraped data to a file* Downloading data from a web page or URL* Logging the scraping process## UsageBefore using the scraper, make sure you have an internet connection. The scraper uses the internet to scrape web pages and translate scraped data.**NOTE:*** The scraper is not a browser. It does not execute JavaScript. It only scrapes the HTML content of web pages.* The scraper requires an internet connection to scrape web pages and translate scraped data.* The scraper was built with HTML5 web pages in mind. It may not work well with older HTML versions.* Some web pages may not be scraped properly due to the way they are structured. This is not a bug. It is a limitation of the scraper.* The scraper only attempts to authenticate with the information provided. The success of the authentication largely depends on the information provided to the scraper. This is because the authentication process varies from website to website. It is up to the user to provide the correct authentication information.* The scraper does not support authentication with CAPTCHA.* The scraper does not support scraping dynamic web pages by default.* Some methods of the scraper may not work properly if the scraper is not instantiated properly. Ensure to read the docstrings of the methods and class attributes before using them.* A number of methods of the scraper use multithreading. This means that the scraper can run multiple threads at the same time. This is done to speed up the scraping process. The number of threads used by the scraper can be set by the user but it is advisable to leave it at its default value.### Importing the module```pythonfrom bs4_web_scraper.scraper import BS4WebScraper```### Creating a scraper objectThe following example shows how to instantiate and customize the scraper's settings. The default settings are used if no parameters are passed to the scraper object.```python# Here, the scraper object is created with the default settingsbs4_scraper = BS4WebScraper()# To customize the scraper's settings, pass a dictionary of the preferred instantiation parameters to the scraper object.params = {    &quot;parser&quot;: &quot;html.parser&quot;,    &quot;markup_filename&quot;: &quot;base.html&quot;,    &quot;log_filepath&quot;: &quot;./scrape_log/log.txt&quot;,    &quot;no_of_requests_before_pause&quot;: 30, # This should not exceed 50 to avoid high frequency requests. The upper limit is 100    &quot;scrape_session_pause_duration&quot;: 20, # pause duration in seconds. It is advisable to leave this at its default, &quot;auto&quot;.    &quot;max_no_of_retries&quot;: 5,    &quot;base_storage_dir&quot;: &quot;./scraped_data&quot;,    &quot;storage_path&quot;: &quot;.&quot;,    }bs4_scraper = BS4WebScraper(**params)```### Instantiation parametersTo read more about the instantiation parameters and class attributes, run the following command:```python&gt;&gt;&gt; print(BS4WebScraper.__doc__)```### Scraping a web pageLet's say you want to download a website/page to your local machine along with its dependencies(like CSS files, scripts, images or fonts), the `scrape` method can be used. Below is an example of how to scrape a web site.```python# Scraping google.combs4_scraper.scrape(url=&quot;https://www.google.com&quot;, scrape_depth=0)```In the above example, the `scrape_depth` parameter is set to 0. This means that the scraper will only scrape the web page at the given url. If the `scrape_depth` parameter is set to 1, the scraper will scrape the web page at the given url and all the web pages linked to it. If the `scrape_depth` parameter is set to 2, the scraper will scrape the web page at the given url and all the web pages linked to it and all the web pages linked to the web pages linked to it and so on.### Translating scraped dataTo translate the scraped data, set the `translate_to` parameter to the language you want to translate to. The following example shows how to translate the scraped data to French. The translation is done using the translation engine specified in the instantiation parameters. The default translation engine is &quot;google&quot; (Google Translate). To change the translation engine, set the `translation_engine` parameter or attribute to the preferred translation engine. The following example shows how to translate the scraped data to French using the Bing translation engine.```python# Scraping a web page and translating the scraped data to Frenchbs4_scraper = BS4WebScraper(...)bs4_scraper.scrape(url=&quot;https://www.google.com&quot;, scrape_depth=0, translate_to=&quot;fr&quot;, translation_engine='google')```To get a list of available translation engines you can use, do the following:```pythonfrom bs4_web_scraper import translate# INTERNET CONNECTION REQUIREDprint(translate.translation_engines)```Translation of the web pages is done immediately after scraping. The `translate_to` parameter is set to &quot;fr&quot; in the above example. This means that the scraped data will be translated to French. The `translate_to` parameter can be set to any of the languages supported by the scraper's translation engine.To get a list of the languages supported by the scraper's translation engine, do:```pythonprint(bs4_scraper.translator.supported_languages)```### Scraping web sites or pages that require authenticationTo scrape websites or pages that require authentication, you can pass the `credentials` parameter to the `scrape` method.The following example shows how to scrape a web page that requires authentication.```python# Scraping a web page that requires authenticationcredentials = {    'auth_url': 'https://www.websitewithauth.com/login_path/',    'auth_username_field': 'usernamefieldname',    'auth_password_field': 'passwordfieldname',    'auth_username': 'yourusername',    'auth_password': 'yourpassword',    'additional_auth_fields': {        'fieldname': 'fieldvalue',        'fieldname': 'fieldvalue',    }}bs4_scraper.scrape(url=&quot;https://www.websitewithauth.com&quot;, scrape_depth=0, credentials=credentials)```You can also authenticate the scraper before scraping by passing the `credentials` parameter to the `authenticate` method. The following example shows how to authenticate the scraper before scraping.```python# Authenticating the scraper before scrapingbs4_scraper.authenticate(credentials=credentials)bs4_scraper.scrape(url=&quot;https://www.websitewithauth.com&quot;, scrape_depth=0)# or in the case of downloading data from a web page that requires authenticationbs4_scraper.authenticate(credentials=credentials)bs4_scraper.download_url(url=&quot;https://www.websitewithauth.com/download/example.mp4&quot;, save_as=&quot;example.mp4&quot;, save_to=&quot;downloads&quot;)# run help(bs4_scraper.downloaded_url) for more information on the download_url method```NOTE: `credentials` should always take the form of a dictionary with the following keys: `auth_url`, `auth_username_field`, `auth_password_field`, `auth_username`, `auth_password`, `additional_auth_fields`. The `additional_auth_fields` key is optional. It is used to pass additional authentication fields that may be required by the website or page.To get a quick template for the `credentials` dictionary, do:```pythonimport bs4_web_scraperprint(bs4_web_scraper.credentials_template)```### Other useful scraper methodsThe following are some useful methods for scraping web data using the scraper class.- `download_url`- `download_urls`- `find_urls`- `find_all_tags`- `find_tags_by_id`- `find_tags_by_class`- `find_comments`- `find_links`- `find_stylesheets`- `find_scripts`- `find_videos`- `find_images`- `find_audios`- `find_fonts`- `find_pattern`- `find_emails`- `find_phone_numbers`For information on how to use these methods, do:```python&gt;&gt;&gt; help(bs4_scraper.&lt;method_name&gt;)```### Other utility classes included in the module- `Translator`- `FileHandler`- `Logger`- `RequestLimitSetting`For information on how to use these classes, do:```pythonfrom bs4_web_scraper.&lt;module_name&gt; import &lt;class_name&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; help(&lt;class_name&gt;)```### Scraper Methods**Before proceeding, it is important to know what an 'rra' means. 'rra' stands for 'resource related attribute'. A resource related attribute is an attribute that is related to a file(resource) that the webpage is dependent on. For example, the `href` attribute of an `a` tag is a resource related attribute because it is related to the resource (link) that the `a` tag points to. The `src` attribute of an `img` tag is also a resource related attribute because it is related to the resource (image) that the `img` tag points to.**#### `download_url`The `download_url` method is used to download files from a web page or url. The following example shows how to download a file from a web page. A simple example usage is shown below:```python# Downloading a file from a web pagefile_handler = bs4_scraper.download_url(url=&quot;https://www.example.com/download/example.mkv&quot;, save_as=&quot;example.mkv&quot;, save_to=&quot;downloads&quot;)# Returns FileHandler Object for the downloaded fileprint(file_handler.filename)```#### `download_urls`The `download_urls` method is used to download multiple files from multiple web pages or urls. The following example shows how to download multiple files from a web page. A simple example usage is shown below:```python# Downloading multiple filesurls = [    &quot;https://www.example.com/download/example1.mkv&quot;,    &quot;https://www.example.com/download/example2.mkv&quot;,    &quot;https://www.example.com/download/example3.mkv&quot;,    &quot;https://www.example.com/download/example4.mkv&quot;,    &quot;https://www.example.com/download/example5.mkv&quot;,]bs4_scraper.download_urls(urls=urls, save_to=&quot;downloads&quot;, fast_download=True)```To define what each file should be saved as, you can pass the `save_as` alongside the url as a dictionary - `urls` becomes a list of dictionaries, as parameter to the `download_urls` method. The following example shows how to download multiple files from a web page and save them with different names```pythonurls = [    {        &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://www.example.com/download/example1.mkv&quot;,        &quot;save_as&quot;: &quot;example_1.mkv&quot;    },    {        &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://www.example.com/download/example2.mkv&quot;,        &quot;save_as&quot;: &quot;example_2.mkv&quot;    },    {        &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://www.example.com/download/example3.mkv&quot;,        &quot;save_as&quot;: &quot;example_3.mkv&quot;,        &quot;save_to&quot;: &quot;./downloads2/&quot;         # This will be treated as an absolute path and will not be saved in `self.base_storage_dir`.         # This file will be saved in its own directory(determined by the path given).    },    # You can also add a normal string url. This will we saved as 'example4.mkv' by default.    &quot;https://www.example.com/download/example4.mkv&quot;, ]bs4_scraper.download_urls(urls=urls, save_to=&quot;downloads&quot;, fast_download=True)```#### `find_urls`This method is used to get all resource related attribute(url or link) on elements that match a given tag name. This method only works for tags that have the `src` or `href` attribute. The following example shows how to find all urls on the `img` elements in a web page:```python# Finding all urls on the img elements on a web page with a class of 'sub-image', saving them to a file and downloading themimg_urls = bs4_scraper.find_urls(url='https://example.com/',target=&quot;img&quot;, attrs={&quot;class&quot;: &quot;sub-image&quot;})# save the urls to a file using the save_results methodbs4_scraper.save_results(results=img_urls, file_path=&quot;downloads/img_urls.txt&quot;)# download the urls using the download_urls methodbs4_scraper.download_urls(urls=img_urls, save_to=&quot;downloads&quot;)```#### `find_all_tags`This method is used to get all elements that match a given tag name. A simple example usage is shown below:```python# Finding all small elements from a url going two levels deepsmall_elements = bs4_scraper.find_all_tags(url='https://example.com/',target=&quot;small&quot;, depth=2)print(small_elements)```#### `find_links`This method is used to get the `href` on all `a` element. A simple example usage is shown below:```python# Finding all links on a web pagelinks = bs4_scraper.find_links(url='https://example.com/')print(links)```**All `find_*` methods have the same usage as the `find_links` method. For example, the `find_stylesheets` method is used to get the `href` on all `link` element with a `rel` attribute of `stylesheet`. A simple example usage is shown below:**```python# Finding all stylesheets on a web pagestylesheets = bs4_scraper.find_stylesheets(url='https://example.com/')print(stylesheets)```#### `find_pattern`This method is used to find all elements that match a given REGEX pattern. A simple example usage is shown below:```python# Finding all elements that match a email REGEX patternpattern = r&quot;^[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+$&quot;emails = bs4_scraper.find_pattern(url='https://example.com/', regex=pattern)print(emails)```### Utility Classes#### `Translator`This class is simply used to translate text, a file or soup from one language to another. The following example shows how to translate text from English to Yoruba:```pythonfrom bs4_web_scraper.translate import Translator# Translating text from English to Yorubatranslator = Translator(translation_engine=&quot;google&quot;)translated_text = translator.translate(content=&quot;Hello World&quot;, src_lang=&quot;en&quot;, target_lang=&quot;yo&quot;)print(translated_text)# If content is markuptranslated_text = translator.translate(content=&quot;&lt;p&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;&quot;, src_lang=&quot;en&quot;, target_lang=&quot;yo&quot;, is_markup=True)print(translated_text)```To translate a file, you can pass the file path to the `translate` method as shown below:```python# Translating a file from English to Yorubatranslator = Translator(translation_engine=&quot;google&quot;)translated_file_handler = translator.translate_file(file_path=&quot;path/to/file.txt&quot;, src_lang=&quot;en&quot;, target_lang=&quot;yo&quot;)print(translated_file_handler.file_content)```To translate a soup object, you can pass the soup object to the `translate` method as shown below:```python# Translating a soup object from English to Yorubatranslator = Translator(translation_engine=&quot;google&quot;)translated_soup = translator.translate(content=soup, src_lang=&quot;en&quot;, target_lang=&quot;yo&quot;)```For specificity, you can use the `translate_text`, `translate_markup` or `translate_soup` methods to translate text, markup or a soup respectively. #### `FileHandler`The `FileHandler` class is used to handle files and perform basic read-write operations on supported file types.**Example Usage**```pythonfrom bs4_web_scraper.file_handler import FileHandler# Instantiating a FileHandler objectfile_handler = FileHandler(file_path=&quot;path/to/file.txt&quot;)# Opening the filefile_handler.open_file()# Closing the filefile_handler.close_file()# Reading the filefile_content = file_handler.read_file(read_mode='r')print(file_content)# Writing to the filefile_handler.write_to_file(content=&quot;Hello World&quot;, write_mode='w')# Appending to the filefile_handler.write_to_file(content=&quot;Hello World&quot;, write_mode='a')# Copying the filefile_handler.copy_to(destination=&quot;path/to/copy.txt&quot;)# Moving the filefile_handler.move_to(destination=&quot;path/to/move.txt&quot;)# Clearing the file contentfile_handler.clear_file()# Deleting the filefile_handler.delete_file()# Getting the file typefile_type = file_handler.filetypeprint(file_type)# Getting the file namefile_name = file_handler.nameprint(file_name)# Getting the file pathfile_path = file_handler.filepathprint(file_path)```#### `Logger`This class is used to log messages to a file and/or console. The following example shows how to log messages to a file:```pythonfrom bs4_web_scraper.logging import Logger# Instantiating a Logger objectlogger = Logger(name=&quot;example_logger&quot;, log_filepath=&quot;path/to/log.txt&quot;)# To log the message to the console alsologger.to_console = True# Set the log levellogger.set_base_level(level=&quot;DEBUG&quot;)# Log a messagelogger.log(message=&quot;Hello World&quot;) # Default log level is INFO# Log a message with a specific log levellogger.log(message=&quot;Hello World&quot;, level=&quot;DEBUG&quot;)```The base log level can be set to any of the following: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR` or `CRITICAL`. The default log level is `NOTSET`. The `to_console` attribute is set to `False` by default. To log messages to the console, set the `to_console` attribute to `True` as shown in the example above. You cannot log at levels below the base log level. For example, if the base log level is set to `INFO`, you cannot log at `DEBUG` level.### Credits- [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)- [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/)- [Translators](https://pypi.org/project/translators/)Contributions are welcome.

	<longdescription>|pypi| |actions| |codecov| |downloads|edc-appointment---------------This module works closely with ``edc_visit_tracking`` and ``edc_visit_schedule``.Subject data is collected on predefined timepoints. We describe these data collection timepoints in a ``visit_schedule`` as provided by ``edc-visit-schedule``. In ``edc-appointment`` timepoints are represented by appointments. ``edc-appointment`` provides classes for creating and managing appointments.See also ``edc-visit-schedule``.AppointmentModelMixin+++++++++++++++++++++A model mixin for the Appointment model. Each project may have one appointment model. For example:.. code-block:: python    class Appointment(AppointmentModelMixin, RequiresConsentModelMixin, BaseUuidModel):        class Meta(AppointmentModelMixin.Meta):            consent_model = 'edc_example.subjectconsent'            app_label = 'edc_example'Appointment is a required foreignkey for the visit report+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++The ``Appointment`` model is a required foreignkey for the visit report. Be sure to set ``on_delete=PROTECT``... code-block:: python    class SubjectVisit(VisitModelMixin, OffstudyMixin, CreatesMetadataModelMixin,                       RequiresConsentModelMixin, BaseUuidModel):        appointment = models.OneToOneField(Appointment, on_delete=PROTECT)        objects = VisitModelManager()        class Meta(VisitModelMixin.Meta):            consent_model = 'edc_example.subjectconsent'            app_label = 'edc_example'CreatesAppointmentsModelMixin+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++A model mixin for the model that triggers the creation of appointments when the model is saved. This is typically an enrollment model.Adds the model field ``facility``. The value of field ``facility`` tells the ``CreateAppointmentsMixin`` to create appointments for the subject on dates that are available at the ``facility``... code-block:: python    class Enrollment(EnrollmentModelMixin, CreateAppointmentsMixin,                     RequiresConsentModelMixin, BaseUuidModel):        class Meta(EnrollmentModelMixin.Meta):            visit_schedule_name = 'subject_visit_schedule.schedule1'            consent_model = 'edc_example.subjectconsent'            app_label = 'edc_example'When ``Enrollment`` declared above is saved, one appointment will be created for the subject for each ``visit`` in schedule ``schedule1`` of visit_schedule ``subject_visit_schedule``.Note: the value for ``facility`` must be provided by the user, either through the form interface or programmatically.Customizing appointment scheduling by ``Facility``++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++see ``edc_facility``Available Appointment Model Manager Methods===========================================The ``Appointment`` model is declared with ``AppointmentManager``. It has several useful methods.first_appointment() last_appointment()++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Returns the first (or last) appointment. If just the ``subject_identifier`` is provided, the first appointment of the protocol for the subject is returned. To be more specific, provide ``{subject_identifier=subject_identifier, visit_schedule_name=visit_schedule_name}``.To be even more specific,  ``{subject_identifier=subject_identifier, visit_schedule_name=visit_schedule_name, schedule_name=schedule_name}``.The most common usage is to just provide these values with an appointment instance:.. code-block:: python    first_appointment = Appointment.objects.first_appointment(appointment=appointment)next_appointment() previous_appointment()+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++The next and previous appointment are relative to the schedule and a visit_code within that schedule. If next is called on the last appointment in the sequence ``None`` is returned. If previous is called on the first appointment in the sequence ``None`` is returned.For example, in a sequence of appointment 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000:.. code-block:: python    &gt;&gt;&gt; appointment.visit_code    1000    &gt;&gt;&gt; next_appointment = Appointment.objects.next_appointment(appointment=appointment)    &gt;&gt;&gt; next_appointment.visit_code    2000But you can also pass an appointment instance and pass the visit code:.. code-block:: python    &gt;&gt;&gt; appointment.visit_code    1000    &gt;&gt;&gt; next_appointment = Appointment.objects.next_appointment(            appointment=appointment, visit_code=3000)    &gt;&gt;&gt; next_appointment.visit_code    4000If you ask for the next appointment from the last, ``None`` is returned:.. code-block:: python    &gt;&gt;&gt; appointment.visit_code    4000    &gt;&gt;&gt; next_appointment = Appointment.objects.next_appointment(            appointment=appointment, visit_code=3000)    &gt;&gt;&gt; next_appointment.visit_code    AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'visit_code'The ``previous_appointment`` acts as expected:.. code-block:: python    &gt;&gt;&gt; appointment.visit_code    1000    &gt;&gt;&gt; previous_appointment = Appointment.objects.previous_appointment(appointment=appointment)    &gt;&gt;&gt; previous_appointment.visit_code    AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'visit_code'delete_for_subject_after_date()+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++This method will delete all appointments for a subject after a given datetime. See also ``edc-offstudy``.``Appointment`` is usually a foreignkey of a visit model. It's important when using this method to ensure that when declaring ``Appointment`` as a foreignkey you explicitly set ``on_delete=PROTECT``. If you don't, the deletion will cascade to other related instances -- and that's bad... code-block:: python    appointment = models.OneToOneField(Appointment, on_delete=PROTECT)Allowing appointments to be skipped using SKIPPED_APPT++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Set ``settings.EDC_APPOINTMENT_ALLOW_SKIPPED_APPT_USING`` to a list of tuples .. [(lower_label, field_name), ...]. The default is ``[]``::    EDC_APPOINTMENT_ALLOW_SKIPPED_APPT_USING = [(&quot;mext_appointment_app.nextappointment&quot;, &quot;appt_date&quot;)]When set, options to skip the appointment will be available on the Appointment form.Note:    This option does not make sense for longitudinal trials following a protocol defined schedule. However    if part of the follow up is driven by routine care, for example, where patients do not follow a strict    schedule, then it may be useful... |pypi| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/edc-appointment.svg   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/edc-appointment.. |actions| image:: https://github.com/clinicedc/edc-appointment/workflows/build/badge.svg?branch=develop  :target: https://github.com/clinicedc/edc-appointment/actions?query=workflow:build.. |codecov| image:: https://codecov.io/gh/clinicedc/edc-appointment/branch/develop/graph/badge.svg   :target: https://codecov.io/gh/clinicedc/edc-appointment.. |downloads| image:: https://pepy.tech/badge/edc-appointment   :target: https://pepy.tech/project/edc-appointment</longdescription>

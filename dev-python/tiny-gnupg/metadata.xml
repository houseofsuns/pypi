	<longdescription>tiny_gnupg - A small-as-possible solution for handling GnuPG ed25519 ECC keys.==============================================================================A linux specific, small, simple &amp; intuitive wrapper for creating, usingand managing GnuPG's Ed25519 curve keys. In our design, we favorreducing code size &amp; complexity with strong, bias defaults overflexibility in the api. Our goal is to turn the powerful, complex,legacy gnupg system into a fun and safe tool to develop with.This project is currently in unstable beta. It works like a charm, butthere's likely, and often bugs floating around, and the api is subjectto change.

Or an open TorBrowser, and the tor_port     # attribute set to 9150) -&gt;    # Optional: gpg.keyserver.network.tor_port = 9150    run(gpg.network_import(uid=&quot;alice@email.domain&quot;))     # Then encrypt a message with Alice's key and sign it -&gt;     msg = &quot;So, what's the plan this Sunday, Alice?&quot;     encrypted_message = gpg.encrypt(         message=msg, uid=&quot;alice@email.domain&quot;, sign=True     )     # The process of encrypting a message to a peer whose public key     # might not be in the local package keyring is conveniently available     # in a single method. It automatically searches for the recipient's     # key on the keyserver so it can be used to encrypt the message -&gt;     run(gpg.auto_encrypt(msg, &quot;alice@email.domain&quot;))  # Signing is automatic     # We could directly send a copy of our key to Alice, or upload it to     # the keyserver. Alice will need a copy so the signature on the     # message can be verified. So let's upload it to the keyserver -&gt;     run(gpg.network_export(uid=&quot;bob@user.net&quot;))     # Alice could now import our key (after we do an email verification     # with the keyserver) -&gt;     run(gpg.network_import(&quot;bob@user.net&quot;))     # Then Alice can simply receive the encrypted message and decrypt it -&gt;     decrypted_msg = gpg.decrypt(encrypted_message)     # The process of decrypting a encrypted &amp; signed message from a peer     # whose public key might not be in the local package keyring is     # conveniently available in a single method. It automatically determines     # the signing key fingerprint, and searches for it on the keyserver     # to verify the signature -&gt;     decrypted_msg = run(gpg.auto_decrypt(encrypted_message))On most systems, because of a bug in GnuPG_, email verification of uploaded keys will be necessary for others to import them from the keyserver. That's because GnuPG will throw an error immediately upon trying to import keys with their uid information stripped off.The package no longer comes with its own gpg2 binary. Your system gpg2 executable is probably located at: /usr/bin/gpg2. You could also type: ``whereis gpg2`` to find it. If it's not installed, you'll have to install it with your system's equivalent of: ``sudo apt-get install gnupg2``.. _GnuPG: https://dev.gnupg.org/T4393_`Networking Examples` ---------------------- .. code:: python    # Since we use SOCKSv5 over Tor for all of our networking, as well     # as the user-friendly aiohttp + aiohttp_socks libraries, the Tor     # networking interface is also available to users. These utilities     # allow arbitrary POST and GET requests to clearnet, or onionland,     # websites -&gt;     from tiny_gnupg import GnuPG, Network, run     client = Network(tor_port=9050)    async def read_url(client, url):         &quot;&quot;&quot;         Use the instance's interface to read the page located at the url         with a wrapper around an `aiohttp.ClientSession` context manager.         &quot;&quot;&quot;         async with client.context_get(url) as response:             return await response.text()     # Now we can read webpages with GET requests -&gt;     page_html = run(read_url(client, &quot;https://keys.openpgp.org/&quot;))     # Let's try onionland -&gt;     url = &quot;http://zkaan2xfbuxia2wpf7ofnkbz6r5zdbbvxbunvp5g2iebopbfc4iqmbad.onion/&quot;     onion_page_html = run(read_url(client, url))     # Check your ip address for fun -&gt;     ip_addr = run(read_url(client, &quot;https://icanhazip.com/&quot;))     # There's a convenience function built into the class that     # basically mimics read_url() -&gt;     ip_addr = run(client.get(&quot;https://icanhazip.com/&quot;))     # POST requests can also be sent with the context_post() method.     # Let's use a POST request to send the keyserver a new key we     # create -&gt;     async def post_data(client, url, payload=&quot;&quot;):         &quot;&quot;&quot;         Use the instance's interface to post the api payload to the         keyserver with a wrapper around an `aiohttp.ClientSession`         context manager.         &quot;&quot;&quot;         async with client.context_post(url, json=payload) as response:             return await response.text()     gpg = GnuPG(email_address=&quot;bob@user.net&quot;, passphrase=&quot;bobs's passphrase&quot;)    gpg.generate_key()     url = gpg.keyserver._key_export_api_url     payload = {&quot;keytext&quot;: gpg.text_export(uid=gpg.fingerprint)}     api_token_json = run(post_data(client, url, payload))     # There's also a convenience function built into the class that     # mimics post_data() -&gt;     api_token_json = run(client.post(url, json=payload))     # Of course, this is just for demonstration. The method that should     # be used for uploading a key to the keyserver is network_export -&gt;    run(gpg.network_export(gpg.fingerprint))    # And there we have it, it's super simple. And these requests have     # the added benefit of being completely routed through Tor. The     # keyserver here also has a v3 onion address which we use to query,     # upload, and import keys. This provides a nice, default layer of     # privacy to our communication needs. These networking tools work off instances of aiohttp.ClientSession. To learn more about how to use their POST and GET requests, you can read the docs here_... _here: https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/client_advanced.html#client-session_`About Torification` --------------------- A user can make sure that any connections the gnupg binary makes with the network are always run through Tor by setting ``torify=True`` during initialization. .. code:: python    from tiny_gnupg import GnuPG    gpg = GnuPG(**user_details, torify=True) This is helpful because there are gnupg settings which cause certain commands to do automatic connections to the web. For instance, when encrypting, gnupg may be set to automatically search for the recipient's key on a keyserver if it's not in the local keyring. This doesn't normally effect `tiny_gnupg` because it doesn't use gnupg's networking interface. It ensures Tor connections through the `aiohttp_socks` library. But, if gnupg does make these kinds of connections silently, using torify can prevent a user's IP address from being inadvertently revealed. Using torify requires a Tor installation on the user system. If the user is running Debian / Ubuntu, then this guide_ could be helpful. .. _guide: https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/debian.html.en_`More Commands` ---------------- .. code:: python    # An instance can also be constructed from lower-level objects -&gt;     from tiny_gnupg import BaseGnuPG, User, GnuPGConfig, run     PATH_TO_GPG_BINARY = &quot;/usr/bin/gpg2&quot;     # Passphrases can contain any characters, even emojis -&gt;     user = User(email_address=&quot;bob@user.net&quot;, passphrase=&quot;✅🐎🔋📌&quot;)     config = GnuPGConfig(executable=PATH_TO_GPG_BINARY, torify=True)     gpg = BaseGnuPG(user, config=config)     # It turns out that the encrypt() method automatically signs the     # message being encrypted. So, the `sign=False` flag only has to be     # passed when a user doesn't want to sign a message -&gt;     encrypted_unsigned_message = gpg.encrypt(         message=&quot;sending message as an unidentified sender&quot;,         uid=&quot;alice@email.domain&quot;,  # sending to alice,         sign=False,  # no sender identification     )     # It also turns out, a user can sign things independently from     # encrypting -&gt;     message_to_verify = &quot;maybe a hash of a file?&quot;    signed_data = gpg.sign(target=message_to_verify)     assert message_to_verify == gpg.decrypt(signed_data)    # And verify a signature without checking the signed value -&gt;     gpg.verify(message=signed_data)  # throws if invalid     # Or sign a key in the package's keyring -&gt;     gpg.sign(&quot;alice@email.domain&quot;, key=True)     # Importing key files is also a thing -&gt;     path_to_file = &quot;/home/user/keyfiles/&quot;     gpg.file_import(path=path_to_file + &quot;alices_key.asc&quot;)     # As well as exporting public keys -&gt;     gpg.file_export(path=path_to_file, uid=gpg.user.email_address)     # And secret keys, but really, keep those safe! -&gt;     gpg.file_export(        path=path_to_file, uid=gpg.user.email_address, secret=True    )     # The keys don't have to be exported to a file. Instead they can     # be exported as strings -&gt;     my_key = gpg.text_export(uid=gpg.fingerprint)     # So can secret keys (Be careful!) -&gt;     my_secret_key = gpg.text_export(gpg.fingerprint, secret=True)     # And they can just as easily be imported from strings -&gt;     gpg.text_import(key=my_key) _`Retiring Keys` ---------------- After a user no longer considers a key useful, or wants to dissociate from the key, then they have some options:.. code:: python    from tiny_gnupg import GnuPG, run     PATH_TO_GPG_BINARY = &quot;/usr/bin/gpg2&quot;     gpg = GnuPG(         email_address=&quot;bob@user.net&quot;,         passphrase=&quot;bobs's passphrase&quot;,         executable=PATH_TO_GPG_BINARY,     )     # They can revoke their key then distribute it publicly (somehow)     # (the keyserver can't currently handle key revocations) -&gt;     revoked_key = gpg.revoke(gpg.fingerprint)  # &lt;--  Distribute this!     # Uploading the revoked key will only strip the user ID information     # from the key on the keyserver. It won't explicitly let others know     # the key has been retired. However, this action cannot be undone -&gt;     run(gpg.network_export(gpg.fingerprint))     # The key can also be deleted from the package keyring like this -&gt;     gpg.delete(uid=&quot;bob@user.net&quot;) .. _key revocations: https://gitlab.com/hagrid-keyserver/hagrid/issues/137``Known Issues``=================-  Because of Debian `bug #930665`_, &amp; related GnuPG `bug #T4393`_,   importing keys from the default keyserver `keys.openpgp.org`_ doesn’t   work automatically on all systems. Not without email confirmation, at   least. That’s because the keyserver will not publish uid information   attached to a key before a user confirms access to the email address   assigned to the uploaded key. And, because GnuPG folks are still   holding up the merging, &amp; back-porting, of patches that would allow   GnuPG to automatically handle keys without uids gracefully. This   effects the ``network_import()`` method specifically, but also the   ``text_import()`` &amp; ``file_import()`` methods, if they happen to be   passed a key or filename argument which refers to a key without uid   information. The gpg2 binary in this package can be replaced manually   if a user’s system has access to a patched version.-  Because of GnuPG `bug #T3065`_, &amp; related `bug #1788190`_, the   ``--keyserver`` &amp; ``--keyserver-options http-proxy`` options won’t   work with onion addresses, &amp; they cause a crash if a keyserver   lookup is attempted. This is not entirely an issue for us since we   don’t use gnupg’s networking interface. In fact, we set these   environment variables anyway to crash on purpose if gnupg tries to   make a network connection. And in case the bug ever gets fixed (it   won’t), or by accident the options do work in the future, then a tor   SOCKSv5 connection will be used instead of a raw connection.-  This program may only be reliably compatible with keys that are also   created with this program. That’s because our terminal parsing is   reliant on specific metadata to be similar across all encountered   keys. It seems most keys have successfully been parsed with recent   updates, though more testing is needed.-  The tests don’t currently work when a tester’s system has a system   installation of tiny_gnupg, &amp; the tests are being run from a local   git repo directory. That’s because the tests import tiny_gnupg, but   if the program is installed in the system, then python will get   confused about which keyring to use during the tests. This will lead   to crashes &amp; failed tests. Git clone testers probably have to run   the test script closer to their system installation, one directory up   &amp; into a tests folder. Or pip uninstall tiny_gnupg. OR, send a pull   request with an import fix.-  Currently, the package is part synchronous, &amp; part asynchronous.   This is not ideal, so a decision has to be made: either to stay mixed   style, or choose one consistent style.-  We’re still in unstable beta &amp; have to build out our test suite.   Contributions welcome.-  The tests seems to fail on some systems because of a torsocks    filter [1_][2_] which blocks some syscalls. This may be patched or not   applicable on non-linux operating systems... _bug #930665: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=930665.. _bug #T4393: https://dev.gnupg.org/T4393.. _keys.openpgp.org: https://keys.openpgp.org/.. _bug #T3065: https://dev.gnupg.org/T3065#111023.. _bug #1788190: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnupg2/+bug/1788190.. _1: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46634215/torsocks-and-unsupported-syscalls.. _2: https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/issues/28861``Changelog`` ============= Changes for version 0.9.0 ========================= Major Changes ------------- -  The ``passphrase`` keyword argument is now processed through the    ``hashlib.scrypt`` function before being stored within a ``User`` instance    &amp; used within the ``GnuPG`` &amp; ``BaseGnuPG`` classes. The ``GnuPG`` &amp; ``BaseGnuPG``    classes also accept an optional ``salt`` keyword-only argument. These    changes secure user keys &amp; passwords by default with a memory-hard    key derivation function &amp; the uniqueness of the user-specified random    salt. These changes provide better security &amp; aren't backwards    compatible. -  The ``email`` keyword argument to the ``User``, ``BaseGnuPG`` &amp; ``GnuPG``    classes was changed to ``email_address``. The attributes in the ``User``    class have also mirrored this change. As well, the ``key_email`` method    on the ``GnuPG`` &amp; ``BaseGnuPG`` classes is now ``key_email_address``. -  The ``User`` class now does type &amp; value checking on the ``username``,    ``email_address`` &amp; ``passphrase`` strings passed into the ``__init__``,    as well as whenever their associated property attributes are set. Minor Changes ------------- -  Documentation improvements. -  Various refactorings &amp; code cleanups. -  More type hinting was added &amp; improved upon. -  Removed the improper usage of the ``NoneType`` for type hinting. -  New constants were added to the ``tiny_gnupg.py`` module to specify    problematic control &amp; whitespace characters that shouldn't be used in    various user-defined inputs &amp; credentials. -  The ``file_export`` methods of the ``GnuPG`` &amp; ``BaseGnuPG`` classes now    saves key files with either ``&quot;public-key_&quot;`` or ``&quot;secret-key_&quot;`` strings    prepended to them to better specify for users the context of files    saved to their filesystems. -  Removed the svg image file which didn't accurately report the line    coverage with the new changes to the package. Changes for version 0.8.2 ========================= Minor Changes ------------- -  Documentation improvements. -  The ``username`` keyword-only argument to the ``User`` &amp; ``GnuPG`` classes    was given a default empty string. This change allows the ``username``    to be optional &amp; ignorable by the user. When generating a key with an    instance which doesn't have a ``username`` specified, then the associated    key will also not contain a username field. Changes for version 0.8.1 ========================= Minor Changes ------------- -  Documentation improvements &amp; typo fixes.Changes for version 0.8.0 ========================= Major Changes ------------- -  The new ``GnuPGConfig`` &amp; ``Keyserver`` classes were extracted from    the ``GnuPG`` class. ``GnuPGConfig`` holds onto each instance's path    strings to the system resources (like the gpg2 binary, the .conf    file, &amp; the home directory), as well as other static constants &amp;   instance specific settings (like the torify boolean flag). And, the    ``Keyserver`` class separates the Tor networking &amp; key upload,    download, &amp; searching logic. -  The ``GnuPG`` class was given a super class, ``BaseGnuPG``, which is    initialized using ``User`` &amp; ``GnuPGConfig`` objects instead of the    strings &amp; booleans which have until now been used to initialize a    ``GnuPG`` instance.  This allows users to choose between initializing    instances using the package's higher-level types or python built-in    types. -  The ``gen_key`` method of ``GnuPG`` &amp; ``BaseGnuPG`` was changed to    ``generate_key``. Minor Changes ------------- -  Docstring, documentation &amp; type annotation fixes. -  Improved the clarity of error messages &amp; the UX of error handling. -  Improved various GnuPG terminal output parsing logics. -  Heavy factorings to improve clarity &amp; better organize the codebase. Changes for version 0.7.9 ========================= Minor Changes ------------- -  Docstring &amp; type annotation fixes. -  Small internal refactorings. Changes for version 0.7.8 ========================= Major Changes ------------- -  Security Alert: Users' separate ``GnuPG`` instance's with the same    home directory, which represent distinct &amp; different secret keys,    can only be considered to represent separate identities during    runtime if the ``passphrase`` for each instance is distinct &amp;    different. Past updates of the package have mentioned separate    identities as if one instance won't be able to access another's    secret keys, and this is **not** true unless their passphrases are    different. This is how GnuPG itself is designed, where all public &amp;    secret keys are stored together in the home directory, &amp; an identity    is more strongly considered to be the current operating system's user.    A more effective way a user can separate identities is by setting a    unique home directory for each identity. However, the GnuPG program    wasn't designed safely as it regards anonymity, so gaining confidence    in its ability to respect more nuanced identity boundaries is dubious    at best. -  The values that are inserted into raised exceptions were renamed to    be declarative of exactly what has been inserted. I.e., instead of    calling all the inserted exception object attributes something as    generic as ``value``, they are now ``inputs``, ``uid``, ``output``,    etc. This helps improve readability &amp; clarity. Minor Changes ------------- -  Various documentation improvements &amp; fixes. -  Various code cleanups &amp; refactorings. -  Added type hints to many of the codebase's parameters.Changes for version 0.7.7 ========================= Minor Changes ------------- -  Some documentation improvements &amp; refactorings. Changes for version 0.7.6 ========================= Major Changes ------------- -  Added the new ``Issue`` class. It takes care of raising exceptions    &amp; giving error messages to the user for issues which aren't caused    by calling the gpg2 binary. This comes with some refactorings. Minor Changes ------------- -  Various code cleanups &amp; refactorings. Changes for version 0.7.5 ========================= Major Changes ------------- -  New ``Terminal``, ``MessageBus`` &amp; ``Error`` classes were created to    assist in some heavy refactorings of the codebase. Separating error    handling logic &amp; sending commands to the terminal into their own    classes &amp; methods. Minor Changes ------------- -  Removed the ``import-drop-uids`` option from the package's import    commands for several reasons. First, this option doesn't work on most    systems. Second, if it did work, the result would be problematic, as    that would mean all uid information would always be dropped from    imported keys. This option was intended to keep GnuPG from crashing    when importing keys which don't have uid information, but it's an    unideal hack around the root problem. -  Some changes to function signatures for a better ux, &amp; various code    cleanups. Changes for version 0.7.4 ========================= Minor Changes ------------- -  The ``homedir``, ``options``, ``executable``, ``_base_command``,    &amp; ``_base_passphrase_command`` attributes are now all properties. This    keeps their values in-sync even after a user changes a ``GnuPG``    instance's configurations. This also backtracks the last update's    solution of reseting static values after every mutation, to a    solution which reads attributes live as they're queried. The reduced   efficiency of not using cached values is not noticeable in comparison   to the many milliseconds it takes to run any gpg2 command.-  Reordering of the methods in the ``GnuPG`` class to better follow a    low-level to high-level overall semantic structure, with positional    groupings of methods which have related functionalities. -  Some other code refactorings, cleanups &amp; docstring fixes. Changes for version 0.7.3 ========================= Minor Changes ------------- -  Now, after either the paths for the executable, homedir or config    file are changed by the user, the ``_base_command`` &amp;    ``_base_password_command`` string attributes are reset to mirror those    changes. This keeps the  instance's state coherent &amp; updated    correctly. Changes for version 0.7.2 ========================= Minor Changes ------------- -  Changed the default directory for the gpg executable to ``/usr/bin/gpg2``.    This isn't going to be appropriate for all users' systems. But, now    many users on linux installations won't need to pass in a path    manually to get the package to work. Changes for version 0.7.1 ========================= Minor Changes ------------- -  Some interface refactorings for the ``Network`` class. -  Some docstring &amp; readme fixes. Changes for version 0.7.0 ========================= Major Changes ------------- -  The package no longer comes with its own gpg2 binary. The ``GnuPG`` class    was altered so that a user can set the path to the binary that exists    on their system manually. The path to the config file &amp; to the home    directory can also be set independently now as well. Although, the    home directory &amp; config file still default to the one's in the    package. These changes should allow users to more easily utilize the    package even if they aren't using Debian-like operating systems. -  The interface for the ``GnuPG`` class was also made a bit smaller by    making some methods private. -  The asynchronous file import &amp; export functions were switched to    synchronous calls. This is a push towards a more sycnhronous focus, as    the gpg2 binary &amp; gpg-agent processes don't play well with threaded    or truly asynchronous execution. The networking asynchrony will    remain. -  Heavy refactoring for method names to make the interface more unified    &amp; conherent. -  The ``GnuPG`` class now only receives keyword-only arguments. The    ``username``, ``email`` &amp; ``passphrase`` parameters no longer use    empty default string values. -  Removed the ``network_sks_import`` method which was no longer working.    The onion sks server seems to change its onion address to frequently    to maintain support within the package. -  Created ``Network`` &amp; ``User`` classes to better separate concerns    to dedicated &amp; expressive objects. Minor Changes ------------- -  Various refactorings. -  Some bug fixes in the html parsing of the keyserver responses. Changes for version 0.6.1=========================Minor Changes--------------  Edits to ``test_tiny_gnupg.py``.Major Changes--------------  Cause of CI build failures found. The sks/pks keyserver's onion address   was not accessible anymore. They seemed to have switched to a new onion   address available here: http://pgpkeysximvxiazm.onion.Changes for version 0.6.0=========================Minor Changes--------------  Changes to deduce bug causing CI failure.Major Changes--------------  Switch from ``aiohttp_socks``'s deprecated ``SocksProxy`` to the newer   and supported ``ProxyConnector``.Changes for version 0.5.9=========================Minor Changes--------------  Add checks in ``network_sks_import()`` for html failute sentinels.Major Changes--------------  Spread out the amount of queries per key in ``test_tiny_gnupg.py`` so   the keyserver's rate limiting policies don't cause the CI build to   fail as often.Changes for version 0.5.8=========================Minor Changes--------------  Fix ``setup`` attribution kwargs in ``setup.py``.Major Changes--------------  Added new ``network_sks_import()`` method which allows users to query the   sks infrastructure for public keys as well. We use an onion address mirror   of the sks/pks network available here: http://jirk5u4osbsr34t5.onion.-  Added new ``manual`` kwarg to ``command`` which simplifies the process   of using the ``GnuPG()`` class to manage gpg2 non-programmatically.   Passing ``manual=True`` will allow users to craft commands and interact   directly with the gpg2 interface.Changes for version 0.5.7=========================Minor Changes--------------  Tests added to include checks for instance-isolated identities.Major Changes--------------  ``reset_daemon()`` calls added to ``decrypt()``, ``verify()``, ``sign()``   &amp; ``encrypt()``. This call kills the gpg-agent process &amp; restarts it,   which in turn wipes the caching of secret keys available on the system   without a passphrase. This is crucial for users of applications with   multiple GnuPG objects that handle separate key identities. That's   because these methods will now throw ``PermissionError`` or ``LookupError``   if a private key operation is needed from an instance which is already   assigned to another private key in the keyring. This gives some important   anonymity protections to users.-  More improvements to error reporting.Changes for version 0.5.6=========================Minor Changes--------------  Added newly developed ``auto_decrypt()`` &amp; ``auto_encrypt()`` methods   to the ``README.rst`` tutorial.-  Allow keyserver queries with spaces by replacing ``&quot; &quot;`` with url   encoding ``&quot;%20&quot;``.-  ``packet_fingerprint(target=&quot;&quot;)`` &amp; ``list_packets(target=&quot;&quot;)`` methods   now raise ``TypeError`` when ``target`` is clearly not OpenPGP data.-  Tests added to account for new error handling in ``tiny_gnupg.py``.Major Changes--------------  ``--no-tty`` seems to keep most of the noise from terminal output while   also displaying important banner information. For instance, signature   verification still produces detailed signature information. Because it   automatically seems to behave as desired, it's here to stay.Changes for version 0.5.5=========================Minor Changes--------------  Added to Known Issues. Our package can't build on Github (Or most any   CI service) for many reasons related their build environments using   Docker &amp; an issue in GnuPG itself.-  Removed Above known issue as a fix was found for using the Github CI   tool.-  Added ``_home``, ``_executable``, &amp; ``_options`` attributes which   store the ``pathlib.Path.absolute()`` representation of the associated   files &amp; directories.-  Added ``options`` attribute with is the str value of the ``_options``   ``pathlib`` path to the configuration file used by the package.Major Changes--------------  Added ``&quot;--no-tty&quot;`` option to ``command()`` method which conveniently   tells gpg2 not to use the terminal to output messages. This has lead to   a substantial, possibly complete, reduction in the amount of noise gpg2   prints to the screen. Some of that printed information is helpful to   see, though. We would add it back in places where it could be informative,   but passing ``&quot;--no-tty&quot;`` has the added benefit of allowing Docker not   to break right out of the gate of a build test. More thought on this   is required.-  Removed ``pathlib`` from imports. That module has been in the standard   library since c-python3.4. This package isn't looking to be supported   for anything older than 3.6.Changes for version 0.5.4=========================Minor Changes--------------  Style edits to ``PREADME.rst``.Major Changes--------------  Fixed a major bug in ``decrypt()`` which miscategorized a fingerprint scraped   from a message as the sender's, when in fact it should be the recipient's.   Getting the sender's fingerprint requires successfully decrypting the   message &amp; scraping the signature from inside if it exists. We do this   now, raising ``LookupError`` if the signature inside has no corresponding   public key in the package keyring.-  Added new ``auto_encrypt()`` method which follows after ``auto_decrypt()``   in allowing a user to attempt to encrypt a message to a recipient's   key using the value in the ``uid`` kwarg. If there's no matching key   in the package keyring, then the keyserver is queried for a key   that matches ``uid`` where then ``message`` is encrypted if found, or   ``FileNotFoundError`` is raised if not.-  Added better exception raising throughout the ``GnuPG`` class:   -  Now, instead of calling ``read_output()`` when the supplied ``uid``      has no key in the package keyring, a ``LookupError`` is raised.   -  The best attempt at deriving a 40-byte key fingerprint from ``uid`` is      returned back through the ``LookupError`` exception object's ``value``      attribute for downstream error handling.   -  ``verify()`` raises ``PermissionError`` if verification cannot be      done on the ``message`` kwarg. Raises ``LookupError`` instead if      a public key is needed in order to attempt verification. ``verify``      can't be used on an encrypted messages in general, unless ``message``      is specifcally a signature, not encrypted plaintext. This is just      not how verify works. Signatures are on the inside on encrypted      messages. So ``decrypt()`` should be used for those instead, it      throws if a signature is invalid on a message.   -  A rough guide now exists for what exceptions mean, since we've given      names &amp; messages to the most likely errors, &amp; helper functions      to resolve them. Users can now expect to run into more than just      the in decript ``CalledProcessError``. Exceptions currently being      used include: ``LookupError``, ``PermissionError``, ``TypeError``,      ``ValueError``, ``KeyError``, &amp; ``FileNotFoundError``.-  ``ValueError`` raised in ``text_export()`` &amp; ``sign()`` switched to   ``TypeError`` as it's only raised when their ``secret`` or ``key``   kwargs, respectively, are not of type ``bool``.Changes for version 0.5.3=========================Minor Changes--------------  Fixing PyPi ``README.rst`` rendering.Changes for version 0.5.2=========================Minor Changes--------------  Futher test cleanups. We're now at 100% line coverage &amp; 99% branch   coverage.-  Code cleanups. ``raw_packets()`` now passes the uid information it's   gathered through the ``KeyError`` exception, in the ``value`` attribute   instead of copying ``subprocess``'s ``output`` attribute naming convention.-  License, coverage, package version badges added to ``README.rst``.Changes for version 0.5.1=========================Minor Changes--------------  Fixed inaccuracies &amp; mess-ups in the tests. Added tests for parsing   some legacy keys' packets with ``raw_packets()``.Major Changes--------------  Bug in the packet parser has been patched which did not correctly   handle or recognize some legacy key packet types. This patch widens   the pool of compatible OpenPGP versions.Changes for version 0.5.0=========================Minor Changes--------------  Removed coverage.py html results. They are too big, &amp; reveal device   specific information.Changes for version 0.4.9=========================Minor Changes--------------  Various code cleanups.-  Added to test cases for auto fetch methods &amp; packet parsing.-  Documentation improvements: ``README.rst`` edits. ``CHANGES.rst``   Known Issues moved to its own section at the top. Docstrings now   indicate code args &amp; kwargs in restructured text, double tick   format.-  Added ``use-agent`` back into the gpg2.conf file to help gnupg to not   open the system pinentry window. This may have implications for   anonymity since multiple instances runnning on a user machine will   be able to use the same agent to decrypt message's, even if the   decrypting instance wasn't the **intended** recipient. This may be   removed again. A factor in this decision is that, it's not clear   whether removing it or adding ``no-use-agent`` would even `have an impact`_   on the gpg-agent's decisions.-  ``_session``, ``_connector``, ``session`` &amp; ``connector`` contructors   were renamed to title case, since they are class references or are   class factories. They are now named ``_Session``, ``_Connector``,   ``Session`` &amp; ``Connector``.-  Added some functionality to ``setup.py`` so that the ``long_description``   on PyPI which displays both ``README.rst`` &amp; ``CHANGES.rst``, will   also be displayed on github through a combined ``README.rst`` file.   The old ``README.rst`` is now renamed ``PREADME.rst``... _have an impact: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47273922/purpose-of-gpg-agent-in-gpg2Major Changes--------------  100% test coverage!-  Fixed bug in ``raw_packets()`` which did not return the packet   information when gnupg throws a &quot;no private key&quot; error. Now the   packet information is passed in the ``output`` attribute of the   ``KeyError`` exception up to ``packet_fingerprint()`` and   ``list_packets()``. If another cause is determined for the error, then   ``CalledProcessError`` is raised instead.-  ``packet_fingerprint()`` now returns a 16 byte key ID when parsing   packets of encrypted messages which would throw a gnupg &quot;no private   key&quot; error. The longer 40 byte fingerprint is not available in the   plaintext packets.-  New ``list_packets()`` method added to handle the error scraping of   ``raw_packets()`` &amp; return the ``target``'s metadata information in   a more readable format.-  Fixed bug in ``format_list_keys()`` which did not properly parse   ``raw_list_keys(secret=False)`` when ``secret`` was toggled to ``True``   to display secret keys. The bug would cause the program to falsely   show that only one secret key exists in the package keyring,   irrespective of how many secret keys were actually there.-  Added a second round of fingerprint finding in ``decrypt()`` and   ``verify()`` to try at returning more accurate results to callers and   in the raised exception's ``value`` attribute used by ``auto_decrypt()``   &amp; ``auto_verify()``.Changes for version 0.4.8=========================Minor Changes--------------  Fixed typos across the code.-  Added to test cases.-  Documentation improvements. ``CHANGES.md`` has been converted to   ``CHANGES.rst`` for easy integration into ``README.rst`` and   ``long_description`` of ``setup.py``.-  ``README.rst`` tutorial expanded.-  Condensed command constructions in ``set_base_command()`` and   ``gen_key()`` by reducing redundancy.-  Fixed ``delete()`` method's print noisy output when called on a key   which doesn't have a secret key in the package's keyring.Major Changes--------------  Added a ``secret`` kwarg to ``list_keys()`` method which is a boolean   toogle between viewing keys with public keys &amp; viewing keys with   secret keys.-  Added a reference to the asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete   function in the package. It is now importable with   ``from tiny_gnupg import run`` or ``from tiny_gnupg import *``. It   was present in all of the tutorials, &amp; since we haven’t decided to   go either all async or sync yet, it’s a nice helper.-  Added ``raw_packets(target=&quot;&quot;)`` method which takes in OpenPGP data,   like a message or key, &amp; outputs the raw terminal output of the   ``--list-packets`` option. Displays very detailed information of all   the OpenPGP metadata on ``target``.-  Added ``packet_fingerprint(target=&quot;&quot;)`` method which returns the   issuer fingerprint scraped off of the metadata returned from   ``raw_packets(target)``. This is a very effective way to retrieve   uid information from OpenPGP signatures, messages &amp; keys to   determine beforehand whether the associated sender's key is or isn't   already in the package's keyring.Changes for version 0.4.7=========================Minor Changes--------------  Fixed typos across the code.-  Added to test cases.-  Added tests explanation in ``test_tiny_gnupg.py``.-  Documentation improvements.Major Changes--------------  Added exception hooks to ``decrypt()`` &amp; ``verify()`` methods. They   now raise ``KeyError`` when the OpenPGP data they’re verifying   require a signing key that’s not in the package’s keyring. The   fingerprint of the required key is printed out &amp; stored in the   ``value`` attribute of the raised exception.-  Added new ``auto_decrypt()`` &amp; ``auto_verify()`` async methods   which catch the new exception hooks to automatically try a torified   keyserver lookup before raising a KeyError exception. If a key is   found, it’s downloaded &amp; an attempt is made to verify the data.Changes for version 0.4.6=========================Minor Changes--------------  Added to test cases.-  Changed the project long description in the ``README.rst``.-  Added docstrings to all the methods in the ``GnuPG`` class, &amp; the   class itself.Major Changes--------------  Turned off options in gpg2.conf ``require-cross-certification`` and   ``no-comment`` because one or both may be causing a bug where using   private keys raises an “unusable private key” error.Changes for version 0.4.5=========================Minor Changes--------------  Updated package metadata files to be gpg2.conf aware.Major Changes--------------  Added support for a default package-wide gpg2.conf file.Changes for version 0.4.4=========================Minor Changes--------------  Added new tests. We’re at 95% code coverage.Major Changes--------------  Changed the default expiration date on generated keys from never to 3   years after created. This is both for the integrity of the keys, but   also as a courtesy to the key community by not recklessly creating   keys that never expire.-  Added ``revoke(uid)`` method, which revokes the key with matching   ``uid`` if the secret key is owned by the user &amp; the key passphrase   is stored in the instance’s ``passphrase`` attribute.Changes for version 0.4.3=========================Minor Changes--------------  Changed package description to name more specifically the kind of ECC   keys this package handles.-  Removed the trailing newline character that was inserted into the end   of every ``encrypt()`` &amp; ``sign()`` message.-  Added new tests.Major Changes--------------  Fixed bug in ``__init__()`` caused by the set_base_command() not   being called before the base commands are used. This leading to the   fingerprint for a persistent user not being set automatically.Changes for version 0.4.2=========================Minor Changes--------------  Added some keyword argument names to ``README.rst`` tutorials.-  Added section in ``README.rst`` about torification.Major Changes--------------  Added a check in ``encrypt()`` for the recipient key in the local   keyring which throws if it doesn’t exist. This is to prevent gnupg   from using wkd to contact the network to find the key on a keyserver.-  Added a new ``torify=False`` kwarg to ``__init__()`` which prepends   ``&quot;torify&quot;`` to each gpg2 command if set to ``True``. This will make   sure that if gnupg makes any silent connections to keyservers or the   web, that they are run through tor &amp; don’t expose a users ip   address inadvertently.Changes for version 0.4.1=========================Minor Changes--------------  Fixed typos in ``tiny_gnupg.py``.Changes for version 0.4.0=========================Minor Changes--------------  Added keywords to ``setup.py``-  Added copyright notice to LICENSE file.-  Code cleanups.-  Updated ``README.rst`` tutorials.-  Added new tests.-  Include .gitignore in MANIFEST.in for PyPI.-  Made all path manipulations more consistent by strictly using   pathlib.Path for directory specifications.-  Added strict truthiness avoidance to ``sign()`` for the ``key``   boolean kwarg.-  Added strict truthiness avoidance to ``text_export()`` for the   ``secret`` boolean kwarg.Major Changes--------------  Added ``key`` kwarg to the ``sign(target=&quot;&quot;, key=False)`` method to   allow users to toggle between signing arbitrary data &amp; signing a   key in the package’s local keyring.-  Changed the ``message`` kwarg in ``sign(message=&quot;&quot;)`` to ``target``   so it is also accurate when the method is used to sign keys instead   of arbitrary data.Changes for version 0.3.9=========================Minor Changes--------------  Added new tests.Major Changes--------------  Fixed new crash caused by ``--batch`` keyword in ``encrypt()``. When   a key being used to encrypt isn’t ultimately trusted, gnupg raises an   error, but this isn’t a desired behavior. So, ``--batch`` is removed   from the command sent from the method.Changes for version 0.3.8=========================Minor Changes--------------  Added new tests.-  Removed ``base_command()`` method because it was only a layer of   indirection. It was merged into ``command()``.Major Changes--------------  Added the ``--batch``, ``--quiet`` &amp; ``--yes`` arguments to the   default commands contructed by the ``command()`` method.-  Added the ``--quiet`` &amp; ``--yes`` arguments to the command   constructed internally to the ``gen_key()`` method.-  Added a general uid —&gt; fingerprint uid conversion in ``delete()`` to   comply with gnupg limitations on how to call functions that   automatically assume yes to questions. The Up-shot is that   ``delete()`` is now fully automatic, requiring no user interaction.Changes for version 0.3.7=========================Minor Changes--------------  Added new tests.-  Typos &amp; inaccuracies fixed around the code &amp; documentation.Major Changes--------------  Added new ``secret`` kwargs to ``text_export(uid, secret=bool)`` and   ``file_export(path, uid, secret=bool)`` to allow secret keys to be   exported from the package’s environment.-  Added new ``post(url, **kw)`` &amp; ``get(url, **kw)`` methods to allow   access to the networking tools without having to manually construct   the ``network_post()`` &amp; ``network_get()`` context managers. This   turns network calls into one liners that can be more easily wrapped   with an asyncio ``run`` function.Changes for version 0.3.6=========================Minor Changes--------------  Added new tests for networking methods.-  Documentation updates &amp; accuracy fixes.Major Changes--------------  Removed a check in ``network_import()`` which wasn’t useful and   should’ve been causing problems with imports, even though the tests   didn’t seem to notice.Changes for version 0.3.5=========================Minor Changes--------------  Switched the aiocontext package license with the license for   asyncio-contextmanager.Major Changes--------------  The packaging issues seem to be resolved. Packaging as v0.3.5-beta,   the first release that did not ship completely broken through pip   install –user tiny_gnupg.Changes for version 0.3.4=========================Major Changes--------------  Fixing a major bug in the parameters passed to ``setup()`` which did   not correctly tell setuptools to package the gpghome folder &amp; gpg2   binary. This may take a few releases to troubleshoot &amp; bug fix   fully.Changes for version 0.3.3=========================Major Changes--------------  Fixed a big bug where the wrong package was imported with the same   name as the intended module. AioContext was imported in setuptools,   but the package that is needed is asyncio-contextmanager for its   aiocontext module. This lead to the program being un-runable due to   an import error.Changes for version 0.3.2=========================Minor Changes--------------  Rolled back the changes in ``trust()`` that checked for trust levels   on keys to avoid sending an unnecessary byte of data through the   terminal. Mostly because the attempted fix did not fix the issue. And   the correct fix involves a wide branching of state &amp; argument   checking. That runs contrary to the goal of the package for   simplicity, so it isn’t going to be addressed for now.-  Edited some of the ``README.rst`` tutorials.Major Changes--------------  Fix bug in ``file_import()`` method where await wasn’t called on the   keyfile.read() object, leading to a crash.Changes for version 0.3.1=========================Minor Changes--------------  Fixed a bug in ``trust()`` which caused an extra ``b“y\n”``   to be sent to the interactive prompt when setting keys as anything   but ultimately trusted. This was because there’s an extra terminal   dialog asking for a “y” confirmation that is not there when a key is   being set as ultimately trusted. This didn’t have a serious effect   other than displaying a “Invalid command (try ‘help’)” dialog.-  Removed ``local_user`` kwarg from the ``raw_list_keys()`` and   ``trust()`` methods, as it doesn’t seem to matter which “user”   perspective views the list of keys or modifies trust. It is very   likely always displaying keys from the perspective of the global   agent.-  Typos, redundancies &amp; naming inaccuracies fixed around the code and   documentation.-  Tests updated &amp; added to.Major Changes--------------  Fixed a bug in ``encrypt()`` which caused a ``“y\n”`` to be   prepended to plaintext that was sent to ultimately trusted keys. This   was because there’s an extra terminal dialog asking for a “y”   confirmation that is not there when a key is ultimately trusted.-  Added a ``key_trust(uid)`` method to allow easy determination of   trust levels set on keys in the local keyring.Changes for version 0.3.0=========================Minor Changes--------------  Changed MANIFEST.in to a more specific include structure, &amp; a   redundant exclude structure, to more confidently keep development   environment key material from being uploaded during packaging.Major Changes--------------  Overhauled the ``gen_key()`` which now creates a different set of   default keys. We are no longer creating one primary key which does   certifying &amp; signing, with one subkey which handles encryption.   Instead, we create one certifying primary key, with three subkeys,   one each for handling encryption, authentication, &amp; signing. This   is a more theoretically secure default key setup, &amp; represents a   common best-practice.Changes for version 0.2.9=========================Minor Changes--------------  Edited some of the ``README.rst`` tutorials-  Changed ``file_import()``\ ’s ``filename`` kwarg to ``path`` for   clarity.-  Fixed bug in ``trust()`` which would allow a float to be passed to   the terminal when an integer was needed.-  Changed the way the email address in displayed in   ``network_export()``, removing the surrounding list brackets.-  Changed the FILE_PATH global to HOME_PATH for clarity.-  Changed the ``id_link`` variable in ``network_import()`` to   ``key_url`` for clarity.Major Changes--------------  Fixed a bug in ``format_list_keys()`` which would imporperly split   the output string when uid information contained the ``&quot;pub&quot;``   string.Changes for version 0.2.8=========================Minor Changes--------------  Edited some of the ``README.rst`` tutorials.Major Changes--------------  Fixed a bug in the ``trust()`` method which caused it to never   complete execution.-  Fixed a bug in the ``trust()`` method which falsely made 4 the   highest trust level, instead of 5.Changes for version 0.2.7=========================Minor Changes--------------  Fixed statement in ``README.rst`` describing bug #T4393.Changes for version 0.2.6=========================Minor Changes--------------  Typos, redundancies &amp; naming inaccuracies fixed around the code and   documentation.-  Added a new POST request tutorial to the ``README.rst``.-  Added ``&quot;local_user&quot;`` kwarg to some more methods where the output   could at least be partially determined by the point of view of the   key gnupg thinks is the user’s.Major Changes--------------  Added a signing toggle to the ``encrypt(sign=True)`` method. Now, the   method still automatically signs encrypted messages, but users can   choose to turn off this behavior.-  Added a ``trust(uid=&quot;&quot;, level=4)`` method, which will allow users to   sign keys in their keyring on a trust scale from 1 to 4.-  Fixed a bug in ``set_fingerprint(uid=&quot;&quot;)`` which mistakenly used an   ``email`` parameter instead of the locally available ``uid`` kwarg.Changes for version 0.2.5=========================Minor Changes--------------  Typos, redundancies &amp; naming inaccuracies fixed around the code and   documentation.-  Tests updated &amp; added to.-  Changed ``raw_network_export()`` &amp; ``raw_network_verify()`` methods   into ``raw_api_export()`` &amp; ``raw_api_verify()``, respectively.   This was done for more clarity as to what those methods are doing.Major Changes--------------  Added ``sign(message)`` &amp; ``verify(message)`` methods.-  Changed the ``keyserver`` &amp; ``searchserver`` attributes into   properties so that custom ``port`` attribute changes are now   reflected in the constructed url, &amp; the search string used by a   custom keyserver can also be reflected.-  Moved all command validation to the ``read_output()`` method which   simplifies the construction of ``command()`` &amp; will automatically   ``shlex.quote()`` all commands, even those hard-coded into the   program.-  Fixed bug in ``set_homedir()`` which did not construct the default   gpghome directory string correctly depending on where the current   working directory of the calling script was.-  Added ``local_user`` kwarg to ``encrypt()`` &amp; ``sign()`` so a user   can specify which key to use for signing messages, as gnupg   automatically signs with whatever key it views as the default user   key. Instead, we assume mesasges are to be signed with the key   associated with the email address of a GnuPG class instance, or the   key defined by the ``local_user`` uid if it is passed.-  Fixed –list-keys terminal output parsing. We now successfully parse   &amp; parameterize the output into email addresses &amp; fingerprints, of   a larger set of types of keys.-  Added ``delete()`` method for removing both public &amp; private keys   from the local keyring. This method still requires some user   interaction because a system pinentry-type dialog box opens up to   confirm deletion. Finding a way to automate this to avoid user   interaction is in the work.-  Added automating behavior to the ``sign()`` &amp; ``encrypt()`` methods   so that keys which haven’t been verified will still be used. This is   done by passing “y” (yes) to the terminal during the process of the   command.Changes for version 0.2.4=========================Minor Changes--------------  Updated ``setup.py`` with more package information.-  Typos, redundancies &amp; naming inaccuracies fixed around the code and   documentation.-  Tests updated &amp; added to.Changes for version 0.2.3=========================Minor Changes--------------  Typos &amp; naming inaccuracies fixed around the code and   documentation.-  Added package to `git repo`_-  Added git repo url to ``setup.py``.-  The ``port`` attribute is currently unused. It may be removed if it   remains purposeless.Changes for version 0.2.2=========================Minor Changes--------------  Typos &amp; naming inaccuracies fixed around the code and   documentation.-  Switched the internal networking calls to use the higher level   ``network_get()`` &amp; ``network_post()`` methods.-  Removed redundant ``shlex.quote()`` calls on args passed to the   ``command()`` method.-  Tests updated &amp; added to... _git repo: https://github.com/rmlibre/tiny_gnupg.gitChanges for version 0.2.1=========================Minor Changes--------------  The names of some existing methods were changed. ``parse_output()``   is now ``read_output()``. ``gpg_directory()`` is now   ``format_homedir()``. The names of some existing attributes were   changed. ``gpg_path`` is now ``executable``, with its parent folder   uri now stored in ``home``. ``key_id`` is now ``fingerprint`` to   avoid similarities with the naming convention used for the methods   which query the package environment keys for uid information,   i.e. ``key_fingerprint()`` &amp; ``key_email()``.Major Changes--------------  Good riddance to the pynput library hack! We figured out how to   gracefully send passphrases &amp; other inputs into the gpg2   commandline interface. This has brought major changes to the package,   &amp; lots of increased functionality.-  Many added utilities:   -  Keys generated with the ``gen_key()`` method now get stored in a      local keyring instead of the operating system keyring.   -  aiohttp, aiohttp_socks used to power the keyserver queries and      uploading features. All contact with the keyserver is done over      tor, with async/await syntax. ``search(uid)`` to query for a key      with matches to the supplied uid, which could be a fingerprint or      email address. ``network_import(uid)`` to import a key with      matches to the supplied uid. ``network_export(uid)`` to upload a      key in the package’s keyring with matches to the supplied uid to      the keyserver. Also, raw access to the aiohttp.ClientSession      networking interface is available by using      ``async with instance.session as session:``. More info is      available in the `aiohttp docs`_   -  New ``text_import(key)``, ``file_import(filename)``,      ``text_export(key)``, &amp; ``file_export(path, uid)`` methods for      importing &amp; exporting keys from key strings or files.   -  New ``reset_daemon()`` method for refreshing the system gpg-agent      daemon if errors begin to occur from manual deletion or      modification of files in the package/gpghome/ directory.   -  New ``encrypt(message, recipient_uid)`` &amp; ``decrypt(message)``      methods. The ``encrypt()`` method automatically signs the message,      therefore needs the key passphrase to be stored in the      ``passphrase`` attribute. The same goes for the ``decrypt()``      method.   -  The ``command(*options)``, ``encode_inputs(*inputs)``, and      ``read_output(commands, inputs)`` methods can be used to create      custom commands to the package’s gpg2 environment. This allows for      flexibility without hardcoding flexibility into every method,      which would increase code size &amp; complexity. The ``command()``      method takes a series of options that would normally be passed to      the terminal gpg2 program (such as –encrypt) &amp; returns a list      with those options included, as well as, the other boiler-plate      options (like the correct path to the package executable, &amp; the      package’s local gpg2 environment.). ``encode_inputs()`` takes a      series of inputs that will be needed by the program called with      the ``command()`` instructions, &amp; ``bytes()`` encodes them with      the necessary linebreaks to signal separate inputs.      ``read_output()`` takes the instructions from ``command()`` and      inputs from ``encode_inputs()`` &amp; calls      ``subprocess.check_output(commands, input=inputs).decode()`` on      them to retrieve the resulting terminal output... _aiohttp docs: https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/client_advanced.html#client-session</longdescription>

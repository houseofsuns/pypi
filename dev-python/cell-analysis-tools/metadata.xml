	<longdescription>### CELL ANALYSIS TOOLSA library for loading, processing and summarizing single cell imaging data. This library was originally created for the Skala lab at the Morgridge Institute for Research/Univeristy of Wisconsin-Madison to process and analyze 2-photon data from time correlated single photon counting. Many functions and implementations can be reused for different image types. It also has examples of how to use some of these functions along with example data. More documentation [Documentation on ReadTheDocs](https://cell-analysis-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)---#### Dependencies* numpy* tifffile * from pathlib import Path* read_roi* os* matplotlib* re* skimage* pandas as pd---#### InstallationThe library can be install through pip `pip install cell-analysis-tools`or the latest version can be installed by cloning the repository, changeing directory to the root of the cell_analysis_tools folder then execute:`$ pip install -e .`you should then be able to import it into your script`import cell_analysis_tools`</longdescription>

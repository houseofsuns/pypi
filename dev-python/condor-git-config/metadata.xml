	<longdescription>##################condor-config-hook##################Hook to dynamically configure an HTCondor node from a ``git`` repository.Hook Overview#############The hook is integrated into a Condor config file to perform the following workflow:* Fetch a *git repository* to a *local cache** Use patterns to *select configuration files** Dynamically *include configuration* in condorTo integrate the hook, use the ``include command`` syntax in any HTCondor config file:.. code::    include command : condor-git-config https://git.mydomain.com/condor-repos/condor-configs.git.. note::  Any arguments in ``include command`` are passed directly to the program, without invoking a shell.           This means that escapes and quotes required for passing arguments on the shell must **not**           be used in the configuration.Usage Notes###########The hook requires at least Python 3.6 to run. A list of options is available by passing ``-h`` or ``--help`` to the executable.Installation------------Installation provides the ``condor-git-config`` executable.All other dependencies are installed automatically.Stable release version.. code:: bash    pip3 install condor_git_configCurrent development version.. code:: bash    pip3 install git+https://github.com/MatterMiners/condor-git-config.gitWe recommend to install the hook to a`virtual environment &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html&gt;`_.However, the hook is simple enough to not disturb global environments.Configuration Selection-----------------------By default, ``condor-git-config`` will not recurse into sub-directories.Only top-level files that end in ``.cfg`` are included automatically.Which files to use can be controlled by arguments that provide regular expressionpatterns to include/exclude files and whether to recurse into directories.In addition, an HTCondor macro is created that points to the root path of the cache.This allows top-level files to easily ``include:`` files from sub-directories.Conditional Inclusion:::::::::::::::::::::Use ``--blacklist`` to exclude files by relative name and``--whitelist`` to add exceptions to blacklisted names.This allows you to have additional configuration, which is conditionally integrated.For example, consider the following git repository tree:.. code::    |- commong.cfg    |- security.cfg    |- aaaron-cloud.cfg    |- aaaron-cloud/    |  |- overwrites.cfg    |  |- proxy.cfg    |- beebee-cloud.cfgThe ``aaaron-cloud`` folder will be ignored by default.You can conditionally include the ``*-cloud.cfg`` files like this:.. code:: bash    --blacklist '.*-cloud\.cfg' --whitelist 'aaaron-cloud\.cfg'This allows you to further include the files in ``aaaron-cloud`` by using ``include`` in ``aaaron-cloud.cfg``:.. code::    # aaaron-cloud.cfg    include : $(GIT_CONFIG_CACHE_PATH)/aaaron-cloud/overwrites.cfg    include : $(GIT_CONFIG_CACHE_PATH)/aaaron-cloud/proxy.cfgThis pattern is especially useful when the whitelist is set dynamically,e.g. by using an argument file that contains the domain name.Argument Files--------------The ``condor-git-config`` executable can use the ``@```prefix character &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#fromfile-prefix-chars&gt;`_to read arguments from files.This allows you to prepare options externally.. code:: bash    $ cat /etc/condor-git-config/branch    --branch    aaaron-cloudand have them used dynamically to adjust configuration.. code::    include command : condor-git-config @/etc/condor-git-config/branch -- https://git.mydomain.com/condor-repos/condor-configs.git</longdescription>

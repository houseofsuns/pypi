[NIfTI-MRS](https://github.com/wtclarke/mrs_nifti_standard) is a standardised format for storing Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy data. These tools are used extensively in the [spec2nii](https://github.com/wtclarke/spec2nii) format conversion program and the [FSL-MRS](fsl-mrs.com) analysis software. However, this library can also be used as a stand-alone set of tools.If you use these tools please cite:_Clarke, WT, Bell, TK, Emir, UE, et al. NIfTI-MRS: A standard data format for magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Magn Reson Med. 2022; 88: 2358- 2370. doi:[10.1002/mrm.29418](https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.29418)_## InstallationInstallation is via [conda(-forge)]() or [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/nifti-mrs/).```conda install -c conda-forge nifti-mrs```or```pip install nifti-mrs```Note this package is a requirement of _spec2nii_ (&gt;v0.4.9) and _FSL-MRS_ (&gt;v2.0.9) and will automatically be installed with them.## Using the package### Command-line tool - _mrs_tools_MRS data stored in NIfTI-MRS format can contain multiple higher dimensions. For example it might contain dimensions encoding multiple receive coils, multiple temporal averages, or even a spectral editing dimension.Data might need to be manipulated within the NIfTI-MRS storage framework before, after, or during preprocessing. For this, FLS-MRS provides the `mrs_tools` command line script. `mrs_tools` has the ability to merge and split NIfTI-MRS files along the higher encoding dimensions. It can also reorder the higher dimensions, or create a new singleton dimension for further manipulation.`mrs_tools split` takes a single file and splits it along a specified dimension e.g. `--dim DIM_DYN`, at a single point (`--index 8`) or extracting multiple elements into a second file (`--indices 8 9 10`).`mrs_tools merge` takes two or more files and merges them along a specified dimension e.g. `--dim DIM_EDIT`. Use `--newaxis` if that dimension doesn't exist in the files already.`mrs_tools reorder` permutes the dimensions of an existing NIfTI-MRS file. For example, the 5th through 7th dimensions can be changed from `DIM_COIL, DIM_DYN, DIM_EDIT` to `DIM_DYN, DIM_EDIT, DIM_COIL` using `--dim_order DIM_DYN DIM_EDIT DIM_COIL`. Reorder can be used to add a tag to a singleton dimension.`mrs_tools reshape` allows Numpy-style reshaping of the higher dimensions. For example if two editing conditions are interleaved you can reshape a file from (32, 128) to (32, 64, 2), and by specifying `-d6 DIM_DYN -d7 DIM_EDIT` you can tag the new dimensions appropriately.`mrs_tools` also contains the `mrs_tools vis` and `mrs_tools info` options to provide quick visualisation and information on the command line. See the [FSL-MRS Visualisation documentation](https://open.win.ox.ac.uk/pages/fsl/fsl_mrs/visualisation.html#quick-glance) for more information on `mrs_tools vis/info`.__Note: visualisation of NIfTI-MRS data using `mrs_tools` requires the installation of the [FSL-MRS package](fsl-mrs.com)__### As a code libraryThe command-line tools presents an interface to the underlying code library. The library can be used directly in interactive or scripted python. For example:```from nifti_mrs.nifti_mrs import NIFTI_MRSfrom nifti_mrs import toolsobj = NIFTI_MRS('path/to/data.nii.gz')# Split the object at index 16 (1-16, 17-N) along the dynamics dimensionpart_1, part_2 = tools.split(obj, 'DIM_DYN', 15)# Save the first partpart_1.save('output/location/part_1.nii.gz')```See the [API documentation](https://wtclarke.github.io/nifti_mrs_tools/index.html) for details.## Contributing and testsContributions to improve or extend these tools via pull requests are extremely welcome. Contributors, please take time to develop tests to continually validate new features or changes.## Acknowledgements### ContributorsWilliam Clarke, University of Oxford  ### Funding acknowledgmentsThis work was funded by the Wellcome Trust [225924/Z/22/Z, 203139/Z/16/Z and 203139/A/16/Z].</longdescription>

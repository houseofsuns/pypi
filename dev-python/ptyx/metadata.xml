	<longdescription>pTyX====Overview--------pTyX is a LaTeX precompilator, written in Python.pTyX enables to generate LaTeX documents, using custom commands or plain python code.One single pTyX file may generate many latex documents, with different values.I developped and used pTyX to make several different versions of a same test in exams,for my student, to discourage cheating.Since it uses sympy library, pTyX has symbolic calculus abilities too.Installation------------pTyX is only tested on GNU/Linux (Ubuntu), but should work on MacOs X too.Obviously, pTyX needs a working Python installation.Python version 3.8 (at least) is required for pTyX to run.pTyX also needs a working LaTeX installation. Command *pdflatex* must be available in your terminal.The easiest way to install it is using pip.    $ pip install ptyxYou may also download and install the latest version from Github:    $ git clone https://github.com/wxgeo/ptyx.git    $ cd ptyx    $ pip install -e .Usage-----To compile a pTyX file (see below), open a terminal, go to pTyX directory, and write:    $ ptyx my_file.ptyxFor more options:    $ ptyx --helppTyX file specification-----------------------A pTyX file is essentially a LaTeX file, with a .ptyx extension, (optionally) some custom commands, and embedded python code.To include python code in a pTyX file, use the #PYTHON and #END balise.A special *write()* command is available, to generate latex code on the flow from python.    This a simple \emph{addition}:\quad    #PYTHON    from random import randint    a = randint(5, 9)    b = randint(2, 4)    write('%s + %s = %s\\' % (a, b, a + b))    #END    Now, some basic \emph{subtraction}:\quad    #PYTHON    write('%s - %s = %s\\' % (a, b, a - b))    #ENDTo access any python variable outside python code scope, simply add a hashtag before the variable name.Any valid python expression can also be evaluated this way, using syntax #{python_expr}.    $#a\mul#b=#{a*b}$However, pTyX has also reserved tags, like conditionals statements #IF, #ELSE, #ENDIF...(More to come...)</longdescription>

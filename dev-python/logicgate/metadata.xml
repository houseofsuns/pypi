	<longdescription>LogicGate=========This language is inspired by logic gates, by using simple alphabet you could make a program.It is designed as a way for manual encryption, which kinda failedAll you can do in this language is to make a program with logic gates,sounds difficult but it depends.Startup-------First, make a logic gate file. The file extension should be .lgesoFunctions---------*Note, this README may sometimes be outdated due to how lazy and busy the dev is, for the most updated description of the function arguments please use &quot;help({func})&quot; and replace {func} with the function you want to check, thank you.*To use it, import **LogicGate** in your python script.Remember for the decompile function, only the filename argument is needed.The *decompile* function will return the incorrect bits if check, gate and ascii is True, decompiled result if ascii is True, and 0 if otherwise.Outputs of the file will be printed(binary to ascii, and logical binary if enabled) if out is True (true by defalt).The *compile* function does the otherwise, it normally doesn't return anything but it can write code into lgeso file, or if write is False(defalt True) then the compiled result will be returned instead of writing into file.Special encrypt module----------------------a special encrypt module is included in this package, which is **lgEncrypt**.it contain two functions, encrypt() and decrypt().*encrypt()* generates a key file and a data file, they are pure random string when transfered to ascii, but shows message when both being processed by decrypt(). encrypt() have 4 arguments, data file name, key file name, message, output. They are very self explainatory*decrypt()* have 5 arguments, data file, key file, sause, debug, debug_ALL. the first 2 is very self explainatory, for *sause* parameter it determinates if the output text is shown or returned for further decryption, assuming the message through encrypt() is encrypted beforehand.For *debug*, it shows the print output that is hidden, it can be enabled for you to check which bit is wrong. For *debug_ALL* it purposely enable everything that is coded with printing(output) except warnings and errors, this will definatly cause massive lag so it is not recommended to enable.syntax------For syntax it is very straight forward. It process each character inevery line as individual command.For gates with multiple inputs (such as or,and) type like other syntax, the quota for the gate will automatically be processed. Any invalid command will raise SyntaxError, in almost all scenarios, the case of the gate does not matter.Basic gates(gates that doesn’t require includes, include feature is in progress):~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~A (and gate): the next **2** results will be accepted as inputs. If bothinputs are 1, output is 1, else 0O (or gate): the next **2** results will be accepted as inputs. If oneof the inputs are 1, output is 1, else 0N (not gate): the next **1** result will be accepted as inputs. If theinput is 1, output is 0, else 01 and 0 (True and False): **NO** result will be accepted as inputs. Theyare the results, self explanatoryspecial syntax~~~~~~~~~~~~~~There are 2 special syntax—-- (three hyphens): new word, used for the ascii output separating the binary for ascii translation. Everything else on the line with this syntax will be ignored.### (three hashes): comment everything after the syntaxFor any of the special syntax, they are not being interpreted as special syntax unless the entire syntax appears. They can be anywhere in a line, and that line will act like what the syntax shows (if more tham one special syntax appears in the same line, they will be scanned and processed accordingto here)examples========This is a hello world in LogicGate``1\n 0\n 0\n 1\n 0\n 0\n 0\n ---\n 1\n 1\n 0\n 0\n 1\n 0\n 1\n ---\n 1\n 1\n 0\n 1\n 1\n 0\n 0\n ---\n 1\n 1\n 0\n 1\n 1\n 0\n 0\n ---\n 1\n 1\n 0\n 1\n 1\n 1\n 1\n ---\n 1\n 0\n 0\n 0\n 0\n 0\n ---\n 1\n 0\n 1\n 0\n 1\n 1\n 1\n ---\n 1\n 1\n 0\n 1\n 1\n 1\n 1\n ---\n 1\n 1\n 1\n 0\n 0\n 1\n 0\n ---\n 1\n 1\n 0\n 1\n 1\n 0\n 0\n ---\n 1\n 1\n 0\n 0\n 1\n 0\n 0\n ---\n 1\n 0\n 0\n 0\n 0\n 1\n``another version generated by LogicGate.compile():``O1NNAANNNNA1AA1AO0AA1AO1NNANNAA1A1111111111\n NNANNAAAO0O000001\n OO0NNN10\n O1O1NNA1O01\n NNOONNA0O0000\n 0\n AA0NNANNOONNNNAO0A1O0000001\n ---\n OO1O1OAO1NNAO111111\n NNNNO0NNAA1O0N01\n OANNOA0O00000\n ANNNNA001\n NNA11\n NNANNA1ANNO0001\n NNAANNAOOA1NNAO10110111\n ---\n OA111\n A1OA1OO0A1O1NNA1O0ONNNNNNN0000\n A1O0A00\n A1O0NNAO0O0A111\n NNAO1NNONNNNA1O1111\n O0A1OANNA0NNOO0ON10000\n 0\n ---\n O0NNN0\n A1ANNNNNNNNNNO101\n O00\n NNA1OO1ONNAO10110\n OAA1110\n OO0AAO0AAONNO0O0NNO00001100\n NNO0A0ONNN10\n ---\n O0O1O0A1NNO1ANNO0AA1O1AA1A1A11111\n NNANNO1ONNNNNNNNNNO0AO11101\n O0OONNNNAAO0N11000\n A1O0N0\n OONNNNOA1ONNOO0AA11100100\n NNO0ON00\n O0OA1NNA1O100\n ---\n O0OO1OO1A1O1000\n NNOO0AONNONNO0A0NNA0NNA010010\n NNAA0OOOA0O000001\n A0NNNNN1\n AO0NNNNA1OO0001\n O0OA1O0O0OO0OA1O00000\n ---\n 1\n A0NNAO0A0OA0NNA1A0000\n NNO0NNA1NNOO011\n NNO0NNA0A0A0NNOO000\n ANNA1AA1NNNNNNNNAA1NNAA1A111111\n NNA1ANNA1OAO1O11111\n A1A1NNA1O1NNANNA1AA1111\n ---\n ONNNNAOO11110\n OANNOONNA1AA1110111\n AA0NNNNNNO0O0A0O0N10\n NNNNNNOA110\n O1OONNA1101\n A1NNNNA11\n ANNOONNAAO1A1ANNA11111011\n ---\n O0NNO0AO0A111\n NNNNNNA1O0ONNA1NNNNO0NNANNOOA1ANNNNAA11110111\n NNO11\n AO0AN101\n OAA1000\n 1\n O0A0NNO0O0NNA0A0NNA1ON10\n ---\n O0N0\n NNNNNNO0ONNA1N00\n O00\n O0AN01\n NNONNNNNNNNA111\n NNNNONNOO0000\n AONNO0ANNO00101\n ---\n O1ONNANNNNA1111\n NNNNOOOO0NNAA1NNONNO1011111\n NNA0A0A01\n AA1N10\n O1OANNNNNNA1ONNNNOO1AOOO1AAN0110111110\n 0\n OOAO0NNO0A0OAANNA0AONNO0001100000\n ---\n A1A1NNO0NNA11\n OA100\n NNANNOA1001\n 0\n NNO0OA0O000\n ANNO0OONNA1O11001\n ---``Sources-------`gitbub&lt;https://github.com/TaokyleYT/LogicGate/&gt;`__\Esolang seldom outdated wiki:`LogicGate &lt;https://esolangs.org/wiki/LogicGate&gt;`__\Replit up-to-date version:`replit &lt;https://replit.com/@s3D27ZHOU/LogicGate&gt;`__</longdescription>

	<longdescription>QtARMSim========QtARMSim is an easy to use graphical ARM simulator. It provides an easyto use multiplatform ARM emulation environment that has been designedfor Computer Architecture introductory courses.The ARMSim ARM simulator, Copyright (c) 2014-20 by Germán Fabregat, isbundled with QtARMSim. It can be found on the ``armsim/``subdirectory of the QtARMSim installation path.1. Installing QtARMSim----------------------In order to install QtARMSim, its dependencies should be installed first.QtARMSim has the following dependencies: `Python3 &lt;https://www.python.org/&gt;`_,`Qt for Python (PySide6) &lt;https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python&gt;`_, and ARMSim.ARMSim, which is bundled with QtARMSim, has in turn the next dependencies:`Ruby &lt;https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/&gt;`_ and the`GNU GCC Arm toolchain &lt;http://gcc.gnu.org/&gt;`_.The next subsections describe how to install QtARMSim and its dependencies onGNU/Linux, Windows and macOS.1.1 Installing QtARMSim on GNU/Linux^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The major GNU/Linux distributions already provide packages for ``Python3`` and``Ruby``. Therefore, the provided package manager can be used to install them.As for the GNU GCC, the required part of the GNU GCC Arm toolchain is bundledwith QtARMSim. Finally, ``Qt for Python`` and ``QtARMSim`` can be installedusing the ``pip3`` command provided by ``Python3``.For example, on Ubuntu you can install QtARMSim using:.. code-block:: shell-session    $ sudo apt install python3-pip ruby libxcb-xinerama0    $ sudo gem install shell e2mmap sync    $ sudo pip3 install QtARMSimOn a Gentoo distribution, you can install QtARMSim issuing (as root):.. code-block:: shell-session    # emerge -av pip ruby    # pip3 install --user QtARMSimIf you are installing QtARMSim on a system where PySide6 is already provided asa package, you can install the packaged version of PySide6 and then installQtARMSim using the ``--no-deps`` option (be aware that the packaged version canbe not so to up to date as the one obtained from pip). Once the PySide6package(s) are installed, QtARMSim should be installed as follows:.. code-block:: shell-session    # sudo pip3 install --no-deps QtARMSim1.2 Installing QtARMSim on Windows^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^To install QtARMSim on Windows please follow the next steps:1. Download a 64 bits **Python executable installer** from   `Python releases for Windows &lt;https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/&gt;`_.   During the installation process, please select the ``Add Python 3.X to PATH``   option.2. Download a 64 bits **Ruby with Devkit** installer from   `Ruby Installer for Windows &lt;http://rubyinstaller.org/&gt;`_.   During the installation process, make sure that the   ``Add Ruby executables to your PATH`` option is selected.3. Open a Windows console (executing either ``Windows PowerShell`` or   ``cmd``, depending on your Windows version), and execute the commands   indicated in the next steps.   3.1. Install the ``shell``, ``e2mmap`` and ``sync`` Ruby modules with:   .. code-block:: powershell     PS C:\Users\Username&gt; gem install shell e2mmap sync   3.2. Install QtARMSim using the ``pip3`` command:   .. code-block:: powershell     PS C:\Users\Username&gt; pip3 install QtARMSim1.3 Installing QtARMSim on macOS^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^To install QtARMSim on macOS, please follow the next steps:1. Download and install **Python 3** from the   `Python downloads page &lt;https://www.python.org/downloads/&gt;`_.2. Open a ``Terminal`` and execute the next command:   .. code-block:: shell-session     $ sudo -H pip3 install QtARMSimAfter doing the previous steps, you should be able to execute QtARMSim bytyping ``qtarmsim`` on a **new** ``Terminal``.Note: If an error message appeared when executing the ``pip3`` command saying thatthere was no matching distribution of PySide6 for your macOS version, you caninstead install PySide6 with`MacPorts &lt;https://guide.macports.org/#installing.xcode&gt;`_ and QtARMSim with nodependencies using the following commands (MacPorts should be installedpreviously):.. code-block:: shell-session  $ sudo port install py39-pyside6   # same version as the installed Python  $ sudo -H pip3 install --no-deps QtARMSim1.4 Installing the ``GNU GCC Arm toolchain`` (optional)^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Starting with version 0.3.1 of QtARMSim, the required part of the ``GNU GCC Armtoolchain`` is already bundled with QtARMSim. So this step should only be doneif there is a problem with the bundled GNU GCC Arm toolchain (i.e., QtARMSimis not able to assemble any source code).In this case, another instance of GNU GCC Arm toolchain can be installed and used.On GNU/Linux, this can be accomplished by installing a GNU GCC ARM packageprovided by the GNU/Linux distribution being used, by building a cross-compilingtoolchain, or by extracting the ``gcc-arm-none-eabi-????-linux.tar.bz2``file from the `GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain Downloads page&lt;https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads&gt;`_.For example, on Ubuntu, this optional step can be achieved with:.. code-block:: shell-session    $ sudo apt install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabiAnd on Gentoo with:.. code-block:: shell-session  # emerge -av crossdev  # echo &quot;PORTDIR_OVERLAY=/usr/local/portage&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/portage/make.conf  # crossdev --target arm --ov-output /usr/local/portageOn Windows and macOS, to perform this optional step, download and execute therespective Windows or macOS GNU GCC Arm toolchain package from the`GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain Downloads page&lt;https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads&gt;`_.Once a new ``GNU GCC Arm toolchain`` is installed, pleaseconfigure the ``ARMSim Gcc Compiler`` QtARMSim option to point to the new``arm-none-eabi-gcc`` executable.2. Executing QtARMSim---------------------To execute QtARMSim, run the ``qtarmsim`` command, or click on the correspondingentry on the applications menu (on GNU/Linux, under the ``Education:Science``category).3. Upgrading QtARMSim---------------------To upgrade an already installed version of QtARMSim, execute the followingcommand on GNU/Linux:.. code-block:: shell-session    $ sudo pip3 install --upgrade QtARMSimOn Windows:.. code-block:: powershell    PS C:\Users\Username&gt; pip3 install --upgrade QtARMSimOn macOS:.. code-block:: shell-session    sudo -H pip3 install --upgrade QtARMSim4. Uninstalling QtARMSim------------------------To uninstall QtARMSim on GNU/Linux, execute the following command:.. code-block:: shell-session    $ sudo pip3 uninstall QtARMSimOn Windows:.. code-block:: powershell    PS C:\Users\Username&gt; pip3 uninstall QtARMSimOn macOS:.. code-block:: shell-session    sudo -H pip3 uninstall QtARMSim5. Installation related known issues------------------------------------If something goes wrong after installing QtARMSim, executing the ``qtarmsim``command on a terminal could give some insight of what is the error cause.The next known issues should not occur if the installation instructions arefollowed to the letter. They are listed here just in case they can be of somehelp when upgrading a previously installed version.+ The 5.14 packaged version of PySide2 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS does not properly  display some icons and SVG images of QtARMSim. This can be solved by  installing a newer version of PySide2 using ``pip``::    $ sudo pip3 install PySide2+ On Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, if the next error is shown when executing QtARMSim from  a terminal::    qt.qpa.plugin: Could not load the Qt platform plugin &quot;xcb&quot; in &quot;&quot; even though it was found.    [...]  It can be solved by installing the package ``libxcb-xinerama0``::    $ sudo apt install libxcb-xinerama0+ Starting with the 2.5 version of the Ruby installer, ``shell``, ``e2mmap``  and ``sync`` ruby modules are no longer bundled in. Therefore, they must be  manually installed using the ``gem`` command, as stated in the general  instructions.+ Versions 5.12.0 and 5.12.1 of PySide2 introduced some changes that prevented  QtARMSim to work. Version 5.12.2 of PySide2 corrected these regressions.License-------Copyright 2014-20 Sergio Barrachina Mir &lt;barrachi@uji.es&gt;This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modifyit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published bythe Free Software Foundation; either version 3 of the License, or (atyour option) any later version.This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, butWITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty ofMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

	<longdescription># Kognic AuthenticationPython 3 library providing foundations for Kognic Authenticationon top of the `requests` or `httpx` libraries.Install with `pip install kognic-auth[requests]` or `pip install kognic-auth[httpx]` Builds on the standard OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow. There are a few ways to provide auth credentials to our api clients. Kognic Python clients such as in `kognic-io` accept an `auth` parameter that  can be set explicitly or you can omit it and use environment variables. There are a few ways to set your credentials in `auth`. 1. Set the environment variable `KOGNIC_CREDENTIALS` to point to your Api Credentials file. The credentials will contain the Client Id and Client Secret.2. Set to the credentials file path like `auth=&quot;~/.config/kognic/credentials.json&quot;` 3. Set environment variables `KOGNIC_CLIENT_ID` and`KOGNIC_CLIENT_SECRET`4. Set to credentials tuple `auth=(client_id, client_secret)` API clients such as the `InputApiClient` accept this `auth` parameter.Under the hood, they commonly use the AuthSession class which is implements a `requests` session with automatic token refresh. An `httpx` implementation is also available. ```pythonfrom kognic.auth.requests.auth_session import RequestsAuthSessionsess = RequestsAuthSession()# make call to some Kognic service with your token. Use default requests sess.get(&quot;https://api.app.kognic.com&quot;)```## Changelog### 3.0.2 (2022-12-07)- Support read credentials from dict### 3.0.0 (2022-09-26)- Rebranded from Annotell to Kognic. - Dropped deprecated `FaultTolerantAuthRequestSession`### 2.0.0 (2022-05-02)Refactor for backend separation, with optional dependencies for either `httpx` or `requests`. ### 1.8.0 (2022-04-12)- Initial support for httpx (BETA). Solves refresh token expiry by reset without the `FaultTolerantAuthRequestSession`  - The library will be refactored by a breaking 2.0 release, and make the same changes to the requests version. The `authsession` module backed by `requests` is untouched for now.   ### 1.7.0 (2022-04-11)- Fix compatibility issue with authlib &gt;= 1.0.0. Resetting the auth session failed, when the refresh token had expired.   ### 1.6.0 (2021-02-21)- Expose underlying `requests.Session` on `FaultTolerantAuthRequestSession`- Fix some thread locks### 1.5.0 (2020-10-20)- Add `FaultTolerantAuthRequestSession` that handles token refresh on long running sessions. ### 1.4.0 (2020-04-16)- Add support for `auth` parameter, with path to credentials file or `AnnotellCredentials` object- Drop support for legacy API token</longdescription>

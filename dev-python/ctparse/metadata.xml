In many ways it buildson similar concepts as Facebook’s ``duckling`` package(https://github.com/facebook/duckling). However, for the time being itonly targets times and only German and English text.In principle ``ctparse`` can be used to **detect** time expressions in atext, however its main use case is the semantic interpretation of suchexpressions. Detecting time expressions in the first place can - to ourexperience - be done more efficiently (and precisely) using e.g. CRFs orother models targeted at this specific task.``ctparse`` is designed with the use case in mind where interpretationof time expressions is done under the following assumptions:-  All expressions are relative to some pre-defined reference times-  Unless explicitly specified in the time expression, valid resolutions   are in the future relative to the reference time (i.e. ``12.5.`` will   be the next 12th of May, but ``12.5.2012`` should correctly resolve   to the 12th of May 2012).-  If in doubt, resolutions in the near future are more likely than   resolutions in the far future (not implemented yet, but any   resolution more than i.e. 3 month in the future is extremely   unlikely).The specific comtravo use-case is resolving time expressions in bookingrequests which almost always refer to some point in time within the next4-8 weeks.``ctparse`` currently is language agnostic and supports German andEnglish expressions. This might get an extension in the future. The mainreason is that in real world communication more often than not peoplewrite in one language (their business language) but use constructs toexpress times that are based on their mother tongue and/or what theybelieve to be the way to express dates in the target language. Thisleads to text in German with English time expressions and vice-versa.Using a language detection upfront on the complete original text is forobvious no solution - rather it would make the problem worse.Example-------.. code:: python   from ctparse import ctparse   from datetime import datetime   # Set reference time   ts = datetime(2018, 3, 12, 14, 30)   ctparse('May 5th 2:30 in the afternoon', ts=ts)This should return a ``Time`` object represented as``Time[0-29]{2018-05-05 14:30 (X/X)}``, indicating that characters``0-29`` were used in the resolution, that the resolved date time is the5th of May 2018 at 14:30 and that this resolution is neither based on aday of week (first ``X``) nor a part of day (second ``X``).Latent time~~~~~~~~~~~Normally, ``ctparse`` will anchor time expressions to the reference time.For example, when parsing the time expression ``8:00 pm``, ctparse willresolve the expression to 8 pm after the reference time as follows.. code:: python   parse = ctparse(&quot;8:00 pm&quot;, ts=datetime(2020, 1, 1, 7, 0), latent_time=True) # default   # parse.resolution -&gt; Time(2020, 1, 1, 20, 00)This behavior can be customized using the option ``latent_time=False``, which willreturn a time resolution not anchored to a particular date.. code:: python   parse = ctparse(&quot;8:00 pm&quot;, ts=datetime(2020, 1, 1, 7, 0), latent_time=False)   # parse.resolution -&gt; Time(None, None, None, 20, 00)Implementation--------------``ctparse`` - as ``duckling`` - is a mixture of a rule and regularexpression based system + some probabilistic modeling. In this sense itresembles a PCFG.Rules~~~~~At the core ``ctparse`` is a collection of production rules oversequences of regular expressions and (intermediate) productions.Productions are either of type ``Time``, ``Interval`` or ``Duration`` and canhave certain predicates (e.g. whether a ``Time`` is a part of day like``'afternoon'``).A typical rule than looks like this:.. code:: python   @rule(predicate('isDate'), dimension(Interval))I.e. this rule is applicable when the intermediate production resultedin something that has a date, followed by something that is in interval(like e.g. in ``'May 5th 9-10'``).The actual production is a python function with the following signature:.. code:: python   @rule(predicate('isDate'), dimension(Interval))   def ruleDateInterval(ts, d, i):     &quot;&quot;&quot;     param ts: datetime - the current refenrence time     d: Time - a time that contains at least a full date     i: Interval - some Interval     &quot;&quot;&quot;     if not (i.t_from.isTOD and i.t_to.isTOD):       return None     return Interval(       t_from=Time(year=d.year, month=d.month, day=d.day,                   hour=i.t_from.hour, minute=i.t_from.minute),       t_to=Time(year=d.year, month=d.month, day=d.day,                 hour=i.t_to.hour, minute=i.t_to.minute))This production will return a new interval at the date of``predicate('isDate')`` spanning the time coded in``dimension(Interval)``. If the latter does code for something else thana time of day (TOD), no production is returned, e.g. the rule matchedbut failed.Technical Background~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Some observations on the problem:-  Each rule is a combination of regular expressions and productions.-  Consequently, each production must originate in a sequence of regular   expressions that must have matched (parts of) the text.-  Hence, only subsequence of **all** regular expressions in **all**   rules can lead to a successful production.To this end the algorithm proceeds as follows:1. Input a string and a reference time2. Find all matches of all regular expressions from all rules in the   input strings. Each regular expression is assigned an identifier.3. Find all distinct sequences of these matches where two matches do not   overlap nor have a gap inbetween4. To each such subsequence apply all rules at all possible positions   until no further rules can be applied - in which case one solution is   producedObviously, not all sequences of matching expressions and not allsequences of rules applied on top lead to meaningful results. Here the**P**\ CFG kicks in:-  Based on example data (``corpus.py``) a model is calibrated to   predict how likely a production is to lead to a/the correct result.   Instead of doing a breadth first search, the most promising   productions are applied first.-  Resolutions are produced until there are no more resolutions or a   timeout is hit.-  Based on the same model from all resolutions the highest scoring is   returned.Credits-------This package was created with Cookiecutter_ and the `audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`_ project template... _Cookiecutter: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter.. _`audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage=======History=======0.3.4 (2022-07-28)------------------* Add fuzzy matching on longer literals* [internal] De-tangle corpus tests into isolated test cases* Allow spaces around separators in ruleDDMMYYYY and ruleYYYYMMDD0.3.3 (2022-07-18)------------------* Add rule for straight forward US formatted dates (`ruleYYYYMMDD`)* Added rule `ruleYearMonth`* Added corpus cases for some open issues that now pass* Changed all internal imports to be absolute (i.e. `from ctparse.x` instead of `from .x`)* Dropped `tox` (now using github actions)0.3.2 (2022-07-18)------------------* Drop support for python 3.6, update dev requirements0.3.1 (2021-07-07)------------------* Add support for python 3.9 on travis and in manifest; update build config0.3.0 (2021-02-01)------------------* Removed latent rules regarding times (latent rules regarding dates are still present)* Added latent_time option to customize the new behavior, defauld behavior is backwards-compatible0.2.1 (2020-05-27)------------------* Update development dependencies* Add flake8-bugbear and fixed issues0.2.0 (2020-04-23)------------------* Implemented new type `Duration`, to handle lengths of time* Adapted the dataset to include `Duration`* Implemented basic rule to merge `Duration`, `Time` and `Interval` in simple cases.* Created a make target to train the model `make train`0.1.0 (2020-03-20)------------------* Major refactor of code underlying predictive model* Based on a contribution from @bharathi-srini: replace naive bayes from sklearn by own implementation* Thus remove dependencies on numpy, scipy, scikit-learn* Predictions are much faster: 97/s in the old vs. 239/s in the new code base* Performance identical* Deprecate support for python 3.5, add 3.8* Add more strict type checking rules (mypy.ini)* Force black code formatting, make this a linter step, &quot;black&quot; all code0.0.47 (2020-02-28)-------------------* Allow overlapping matches of regular expression when generating inital stack of &quot;tokens&quot;0.0.46 (2020-02-26)-------------------* Implemented heuristics to detect (albeit imperfectly) military times0.0.44 (2019-11-05)-------------------* Released time corpus* Implemented training model using ctparse corpus0.0.43 (2019-11-01)-------------------* Added slash as a general separator* Added ruleTODTOD (to support expression like afternoon/evening)0.0.42 (2019-10-30)-------------------* Removed nb module* Fix for two digit years* Freshly retrained model binary file0.0.41 (2019-10-29)-------------------* Fix run_corpus refactoring bug* Implemented retraining utilities0.0.40 (2019-10-25)-------------------* update develop dependencies* remove unused Protocol import from typing_extensions0.0.39 (2019-10-24)-------------------* split ctparse file into several different modules* added types to public interface* introduced the Scorer abstraction to implement richer scoring strategies0.0.38 (2018-11-05)-------------------* Added python 3.7 to supported versions (fix on travis available)0.0.8 (2018-06-07)------------------* First release on PyPI.</longdescription>

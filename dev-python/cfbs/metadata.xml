	<longdescription># CFEngine Build SystemThis is a command line tool for combining multiple modules into 1 policy set to deploy on your infrastructure.Modules can be custom promise types, JSON files which enable certain functionality, or reusable CFEngine policy.The modules you use can be written by the CFEngine team, others in the community, your colleagues, or yourself.## CFEngine Build Repositories* [build-index](https://github.com/cfengine/build-index) - Index of modules* [build-website](https://github.com/cfengine/build-website) - Website* [cfbs](https://github.com/cfengine/cfbs) - Command line client* [modules](https://github.com/cfengine/modules) - Official modules provided by the CFEngine team* [module-template](https://github.com/cfengine/build-example) - Template for creating new modules## InstallationRequires Python 3.5 or newer and `pip`.```pip install cfbs```(or `sudo pip3 install cfbs` or whatever works with Python 3 on your system).It is also **recommended** to install `cf-remote` if you want to deploy the policy set to remote hub(s):```pip install cf-remote```### Install from sourcesIf you want to install an unreleased version of `cfbs`, such as the master branch, just run this inside [the git repo](https://github.com/cfengine/cfbs):```$ cfbs install .```### Dependencies`cfbs` is implemented in Python and has a few dependencies:* Python 3.5 or newer* `git` CLI installed and in PATH* `rsync`* `autoconf` for configuring masterfiles module (typical usage but not required)## UsageHere are the basic commands to set up a repo, add dependencies, build and deploy.### Initialize a new repo```cfbs init```### List or search available packages```cfbs search```Or more specific:```cfbs search masterfiles```(`masterfiles` is the name of a module and can be replaced with whatever you are looking for).### Add a module```cfbs add masterfiles```### Build your policy set```cfbs build```### Install your policy set locally```cfbs install /var/cfengine/masterfiles```### Remove added modules```cfbs remove promise-type-git```### Remove unused dependencies```cfbs clean```### Add module input```cfbs input delete-files```This command prompts the user for module input to configure what the module should do.Only works for modules which accept input, indicated by the `&quot;input&quot;` key.This `input` key contains the specification for what input the module accepts, if any.User's responses are stored in `&lt;module-name&gt;/input.json`.For completeness, the input specification is also stored with the responses.Here is an example of a `input.json` file with responses:```json[  {    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;list&quot;,    &quot;variable&quot;: &quot;files&quot;,    &quot;bundle&quot;: &quot;delete_files&quot;,    &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Files&quot;,    &quot;subtype&quot;: [      {        &quot;key&quot;: &quot;path&quot;,        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;,        &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Path&quot;,        &quot;question&quot;: &quot;Enter path to file&quot;      },      {        &quot;key&quot;: &quot;why&quot;,        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;,        &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Why&quot;,        &quot;question&quot;: &quot;Why should this file be deleted?&quot;,        &quot;default&quot;: &quot;It's malicious.&quot;      }    ],    &quot;while&quot;: &quot;Do you want the module to delete more files?&quot;,    &quot;response&quot;: [      { &quot;path&quot;: &quot;/tmp/virus&quot;, &quot;why&quot;: &quot;It's malicious.&quot; },      { &quot;path&quot;: &quot;/home/alice/.ssh/authorized_keys&quot;, &quot;why&quot;: &quot;She left the company.&quot; }    ]  }]```The `input.json` file is converted and merged into the main `def.json` during the build, using the `input` build step.### Deploy your policy set to a remote hub```cf-remote deploy```This will default to the hub(s) you have spawned or saved in `cf-remote`.To specify a hub manually:```cf-remote deploy --hub hub```where `hub` is a `cf-remote` group name, or:```cf-remote deploy --hub root@1.2.3.4```## ExamplesThere is an example project available here:https://github.com/cfengine/cfbs-example### Creating a project from scratchThese commands and output shows how you can use `cfbs` to create a new project from scratch:```$ mkdir demo-project$ cd demo-project$ cfbs --versioncfbs 0.4.4$ cfbs initInitialized - edit name and description cfbs.jsonTo add your first module, type: cfbs add masterfiles$ cfbs add masterfilesAdded module: masterfiles$ cfbs add gitgit is an alias for promise-type-gitAdded module: library-for-promise-types-in-python (Dependency of promise-type-git)Added module: promise-type-git$ cfbs buildModules:001 masterfiles                         @ 28d9b933db5fc8e1dea4338669cc4fd6677646f1 (Downloaded)002 library-for-promise-types-in-python @ 1438ad8515267b3dd4b862cfcd63c1b9ccfb42e1 (Downloaded)003 promise-type-git                    @ 1438ad8515267b3dd4b862cfcd63c1b9ccfb42e1 (Downloaded)Steps:001 masterfiles                         : run './autogen.sh'001 masterfiles                         : delete './autogen.sh'001 masterfiles                         : copy './' 'masterfiles/'002 library-for-promise-types-in-python : copy 'cfengine.py' 'masterfiles/modules/promise_types/'003 promise-type-git                    : copy 'git.py' 'masterfiles/modules/promise_types/'003 promise-type-git                    : append 'enable.cf' 'masterfiles/services/init.cf'Generating tarball...Build complete, ready to deploy 🐿 -&gt;

Modules are skipped if already downloaded.* `cfbs build`: Build the project, combining all the modules into 1 output policy set.  Download modules if necessary.  Should work offline if things are already downloaded (by `cfbs download`).* `cfbs get-input`: Get input data for a module.  Includes both the specification for what the module accepts as well as the user's responses.  Can be used on modules not yet added to project to get just the specification.  Empty list `[]` is returned if the module was found, but it does not accept any input.* `cfbs install`: Run this on a hub as root to install the policy set (copy the files from `out/masterfiles` to `/var/cfengine/masterfiles`).* `cfbs pretty`: Run on a JSON file to pretty-format it. (May be expanded to other formats in the future).* `cfbs set-input`: Set input data for a module.  Non-interactive version of `cfbs input`, takes the input as a JSON, validates it and stores it.  `cfbs set-input` and `cfbs get-input` can be thought of as ways to save and load the input file.  Similar to `cfbs get-input` the JSON contains both the specification (what the module accepts and how it's presented to the user) as well as the user's responses (if present).  Expected usage is to run `cfbs get-input` to get the JSON, and then fill out the response part and run `cfbs set-input`.* `cfbs validate`: Used to validate the [index JSON file](https://github.com/cfengine/build-index/blob/master/cfbs.json).  May be expanded to validate other files and formats in the future.They don't have interactive prompts, you can expect fewer changes to them, and backwards compatibility is much more important than with the interactive commands above.## The cfbs.json formatMore advanced users and module authors may need to understand, write, or edit `cfbs.json` files.The format of those files and how `cfbs` uses them is explained in detail in [JSON.md](./JSON.md).</longdescription>

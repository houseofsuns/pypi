This marker automatically applies to all tests in a specified integration test folder.Integration tests will not run by default, which is useful for cases where an external dependencyneeds to be set up first (such as a database service).# InstallationThis is a pure python package, so it can be installed with `pip install pytest-integration-mark` or any other dependency manager.# UsageAfter installation:Running `pytest` as usual:- Tests marked with `@pytest.mark.integration` will be skipped- Tests in `./tests/integration/...` will be skippedRunning `pytest --with-integration`:- Tests marked with `@pytest.mark.integration` will run- Tests in `./tests/integration/...` will runRunning `pytest --with-integration --integration-tests-folder integration`:- Tests marked with `@pytest.mark.integration` will run- Tests in `./integration/...` will run# DevelopmentThis library uses the [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) package manager, which has to be installed before installingother dependencies. Afterwards, run `poetry install` to create a virtualenv and install all dependencies.To then activate that environment, use `poetry shell`. To run a command in the environment without activating it,use `poetry run &lt;command&gt;`.[Black](https://github.com/psf/black) is used (and enforced via workflows) to format all code. Poetry will install itautomatically, but running it is up to the user. To format the entire project, run `black .` inside the virtualenv.# ContributingThis project uses the Apache 2.0 license and is maintained by the data science team @ Barbora.

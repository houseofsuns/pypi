	<longdescription>ezdxf=====Abstract--------This Python package is designed to facilitate the creation and manipulation of DXF documents, with compatibility across various DXF versions. It empowers users to seamlessly load and edit DXF files while preserving all content, except for comments.Any unfamiliar DXF tags encountered in the document are gracefully ignored but retained for future modifications. This feature enables the processing of DXF documents containing data from third-party applications without any loss of valuable information.Quick-Info----------- *ezdxf* is a Python package to create new DXF files and read/modify/write   existing DXF documents- MIT-License- the intended audience are programmers- requires at least Python 3.8- OS independent- tested with CPython and pypy3- has type annotations and passes `mypy --ignore-missing-imports -p ezdxf` successful- additional required packages for the core package without add-ons:   [typing_extensions](https://pypi.org/project/typing-extensions/),   [pyparsing](https://pypi.org/project/pyparsing/),  [numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/),  [fontTools](https://pypi.org/project/fonttools/)- read/write/new support for DXF versions: R12, R2000, R2004, R2007, R2010, R2013 and R2018- additional read-only support for DXF versions R13/R14 (upgraded to R2000)- additional read-only support for older DXF versions than R12 (upgraded to R12)- read/write support for ASCII DXF and Binary DXF- retains third-party DXF content- optional C-extensions for CPython are included in the binary wheels, available   on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ezdxf/) for Windows, Linux and macOS- command line script `ezdxf` to display, convert and inspect DXF filesIncluded Extensions-------------------Additional packages required for these add-ons are not automatically installed during the *basic* setup, for more information about the setup &amp; dependencies visit the [documentation](https://ezdxf.mozman.at/docs/setup.html).- The `drawing` add-on is a translation layer to send DXF data to a render backend,   interfaces to [matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/), which can export   images as PNG, PDF or SVG, and [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) are implemented.- `r12writer` add-on to write basic DXF entities direct and fast into a DXF R12   file or stream- `iterdxf` add-on to iterate over DXF entities from the modelspace of huge DXF   files (&gt; 5GB) which do not fit into memory- `Importer` add-on to import entities, blocks and table entries from another DXF document- `dxf2code` add-on to generate Python code for DXF structures loaded from DXF   documents as starting point for parametric DXF entity creation- `acadctb` add-on to read/write plot style files (CTB/STB)- `pycsg` add-on for basic Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) modeling- `MTextExplode` add-on for exploding MTEXT entities into single-line TEXT entities- `text2path` add-on to convert text into outline paths- `geo` add-on to support the [`__geo_interface__`](https://gist.github.com/sgillies/2217756)- `meshex` for exchanging meshes with other tools as STL, OFF or OBJ files- `openscad` add-on, an interface to [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org)- `odafc` add-on, an interface to the [ODA File Converter](https://www.opendesign.com/guestfiles/oda_file_converter)   to read and write DWG files- `hpgl2` add-on for converting HPGL/2 plot files to DXF, SVG and PDFA simple example:```Pythonimport ezdxffrom ezdxf import colorsfrom ezdxf.enums import TextEntityAlignment# Create a new DXF document.doc = ezdxf.new(dxfversion=&quot;R2010&quot;)# Create new table entries (layers, linetypes, text styles, ...).doc.layers.add(&quot;TEXTLAYER&quot;, color=colors.RED)# DXF entities (LINE, TEXT, ...) reside in a layout (modelspace, # paperspace layout or block definition).  msp = doc.modelspace()# Add entities to a layout by factory methods: layout.add_...() msp.add_line((0, 0), (10, 0), dxfattribs={&quot;color&quot;: colors.YELLOW})msp.add_text(    &quot;Test&quot;,     dxfattribs={        &quot;layer&quot;: &quot;TEXTLAYER&quot;    }).set_placement((0, 0.2), align=TextEntityAlignment.CENTER)# Save the DXF document.doc.saveas(&quot;test.dxf&quot;)```Example for the *r12writer*, which writes a simple DXF R12 file without in-memory structures:```Pythonfrom random import randomfrom ezdxf.addons import r12writerMAX_X_COORD = 1000MAX_Y_COORD = 1000with r12writer(&quot;many_circles.dxf&quot;) as doc:    for _ in range(100000):        doc.add_circle((MAX_X_COORD*random(), MAX_Y_COORD*random()), radius=2)```The r12writer supports only the ENTITIES section of a DXF R12 drawing, no HEADER, TABLES or BLOCKS section is present, except FIXED-TABLES are written, than some additional predefined text styles and line types are available.Installation------------Basic installation by pip including the optional C-extensions from PyPI as binary wheels:    pip install ezdxfFull installation with all dependencies (matplotlib, PySide6) for using the drawing add-on:    pip install ezdxf[draw]For more information about the setup &amp;

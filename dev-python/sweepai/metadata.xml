Here are the steps to get started:1. Add the [Sweep GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai) to your desired repos2. Read about [recipes](docs/Recipes.md) for best use cases.2. Create a new issue in your repo. The issue should describe the problem or feature you want Sweep to address. For example, you could write &quot;Sweep: In sweepai/app/ui.py use an os-agnostic temp directory&quot;3. Respond with a message like &quot;Sweep: use a different package instead&quot; to have Sweep retry the issue or pull request. You can also comment on the code for minor changes! Remember to put the &quot;Sweep:&quot; prefix.   - 💡 Hint: commenting &quot;revert&quot; reverts all edits in a file.We support all languages GPT4 supports, including Python, Typescript, Rust, Go, Java, C# and C++.### 🗨️ Sweep ChatSweep Chat allows you to interact with Sweep and GitHub locally. You can collaborate on the plan with Sweep, and then have it create the pull request for you. Here's how to use Sweep Chat:**Prerequisites:** Install [Sweep GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai) to your repository1. Run `pip3 install sweepai &amp;&amp; sweep`. Note that you need **python 3.10+.**    - Alternatively run `pip3 install --force-reinstall sweepai &amp;&amp; sweep` if the previous command fails.    - This runs GitHub authentication in your browser.2. Copy the 🔵 blue 8-digit code from your terminal into the page. You should only need to do the authentication once.      - Wait a few seconds and Sweep Chat will start. 3. Choose a repository from the dropdown at the top (the Github app must be installed to this repository).    - ⚡ Start chatting with Sweep Chat! ⚡![Screenshot_20230711_015033](https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/assets/26889185/ed9f05d8-ef86-4f2a-9bca-acdfa24990ac)Tips:* 🔍 Relevant searched files will show up on the right. * 🔘 Sweep Chat creates PRs when the &quot;Create PR&quot; button is clicked. * 💡 You can force dark mode by going to http://127.0.0.1:7861/?__theme=dark.#### From SourceIf you want the nightly build and or if the latest build has issues.1. `git clone https://github.com/sweepai/sweep &amp;&amp; poetry install`2. `python sweepai/app/cli.py`. Note that you need **python 3.10+**.## 💰 Pricing* We charge $120/month for 60 GPT4 tickets per month.* For unpaid users, we offer 5 free GPT4 tickets per month.* We also offer unlimited GPT3.5 tickets.## 🤝 ContributingContributions are welcome and greatly appreciated! For detailed guidelines on how to contribute, please see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.For more detailed docs, see [🚀 Quickstart](https://docs.sweep.dev/).## 📘 StoryWe were frustrated by small tickets, like simple bug fixes, annoying refactors, and small features. Each task required us to open our IDE to fix simple bugs. So we decided to leverage the capabilities of ChatGPT to address this directly in GitHub.Unlike existing AI solutions, this can solve entire tickets and can be parallelized + asynchronous: developers can spin up 10 tickets and Sweep will address them all at once.## 📚 The Stack- GPT-4 32k 0613 (default)- ActiveLoop DeepLake for Vector DB with MiniLM L12 as our embeddings model- Modal Labs for infra + deployment- Gradio for Sweep Chat## 🗺️ RoadmapSee [🗺️ Roadmap](https://docs.sweep.dev/roadmap)## ⭐ Star History[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=sweepai/sweep&amp;type=Date)](https://star-history.com/#sweepai/sweep&amp;Date)Consider starring us if you're using Sweep so more people hear about us!&lt;h2 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;    Contributors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;    Thank you for your contribution!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;    &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/graphs/contributors&quot;&gt;      &lt;img src=&quot;https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=sweepai/sweep&quot; /&gt;    &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;    and, of course, Sweep!&lt;/p&gt;</longdescription>

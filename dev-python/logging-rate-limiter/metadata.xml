	<longdescription># logging-rate-limitera simple logging filter which can be used to limit the amount of logs getting out from a system.It uses token bucket algorithm internally.#### Installation- from pypi```pip install logging_rate_limiter```#### Usage- check `tests/test_logging.py` for a complete example- on a basic level this filter can be added to a logger or a logging handler- this filter takes multiple optional keywords with key as log_level and value as a dict with 3 keys```&quot;DEBUG&quot;: {    &quot;tokens_per_sec&quot;: 1,    &quot;starting_tokens&quot;: 1, # optional, default=0    &quot;max_tokens_balance&quot;: 1 # optional, default=infinity}```- `tokens_per_sec`: the number of tokens(logs) which will be available for a given log level- `starting_tokens`: the number of tokens already available at the start of the logging initialisation- `max_tokens_balance`: the maximum number of tokens that can be accumulated if the logs for a particular level are not being requested as much as the `tokens_per_sec` allowed. kind of limited burst balance.- besides providing this config for particular log levels, you can supply a `default` key with this config.- if a `default` is supplied and there is no config supplied for a requested log level then this requested log level will be checked against this default config. useful for scenario where you want an overall rate shared across multiple log levels.- besides this an optional `result_callback` can be supplied which will be called everytime a log record goes through filter function- the `result_callback` must accept 2 params `result` which is a boolean telling whether the log record was filtered or not and `record` the original log record.#### Pytest- pytest tests/#### License- this project is licensed under [MIT License](LICENSE)</longdescription>

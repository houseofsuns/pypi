	<longdescription># dapla-toolbeltPython module for use within Jupyterlab notebooks, specifically aimed for Statistics Norway's data platform called `Dapla`. It contains support for authenticated access to Google Services such as Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and customDapla services such as [Maskinporten Guardian](https://github.com/statisticsnorway/maskinporten-guardian). The authentication process is based on the [TokenExchangeAuthenticator](https://github.com/statisticsnorway/jupyterhub-extensions/tree/main/TokenExchangeAuthenticator)for Jupyterhub.[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/dapla-toolbelt.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dapla-toolbelt/)![Unit tests](https://github.com/statisticsnorway/dapla-toolbelt/actions/workflows/unit-tests.yml/badge.svg) ![Code coverage](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/bjornandre/73205f2f30335801fa2819c31b3ecf79/raw/pytest-coverage-badge-dapla-toolbelt.json) ![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)[![License](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/dapla-toolbelt.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dapla-toolbelt/)These operations are supported:* List contents of a bucket* Open a file in GCS* Copy a file from GCS into local* Load a file (CSV, JSON or XML) from GCS into a pandas dataframe* Save contents of a data frame into a file (CSV, JSON, XML) in GCSWhen the user gives the path to a resource, they do not need to give the GCS uri, only the path. This just means users don't have to prefix a path with &quot;gs://&quot;. It is implicitly understood that all resources accessed with this tool are located in GCS, with the first level of the path being a GCS bucket name.## Installation`pip install dapla-toolbelt`## Usage Examples``` pythonfrom dapla import FileClientfrom dapla import GuardianClientimport pandas as pd# Load data using the Maskinporten Guardian clientresponse = GuardianClient.call_api(&quot;https://data.udir.no/api/kag&quot;, &quot;88ace991-7871-4ccc-aaec-8fb6d78ed04e&quot;, &quot;udir:datatilssb&quot;)data_json = response.json()raw_data_df = pd.DataFrame(data_json)  # create pandas data frame from jsonraw_data_df.head()  # show first rows of data frameFileClient.ls(&quot;bucket-name/folder&quot;)  # list contents of given folder# Save data into different formatspath_base = &quot;bucket-name/folder/raw_data&quot;FileClient.save_pandas_to_json(raw_data_df, f&quot;{path_base}.json&quot;)  # generate json from data frame, and save to given pathFileClient.save_pandas_to_csv(raw_data_df, f&quot;{path_base}.csv&quot;)  # generate csv from data frame, and save to given pathFileClient.save_pandas_to_xml(raw_data_df, f&quot;{path_base}.xml&quot;)  # generate xml from data frame, and save to given pathFileClient.cat(f&quot;{path_base}.json&quot;)  # print contents of file# Load data from different formats# All these data frames should contain the same data:df = FileClient.load_json_to_pandas(f&quot;{path_base}.json&quot;)  # read json from path and load into pandas data framedf.head()  # show first rows of data framedf = FileClient.load_csv_to_pandas(f&quot;{path_base}.csv&quot;)  # read csv from path and load into pandas data framedf.head()  # show first rows of data framedf = FileClient.load_xml_to_pandas(f&quot;{path_base}.xml&quot;)  # read xml from path and load into pandas data framedf.head()  # show first rows of data frame```## Development### Prerequisites- Python &gt;3.8 (3.10 is preferred)- Poetry, install via `curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -`You can also execute `make` in the project folder to see available `make` commands.### Dependency ManagementPoetry is used for dependency management. [Poe the Poet](https://github.com/nat-n/poethepoet) is used for running poe tasks within poetry's virtualenv. Upon cloning this project first install necessary dependencies, then run the tests to verify everything is working.#### Install all dependencies```shellpoetry install```### Add dependencies#### Main```shellpoetry add &lt;python package name&gt;```#### Dev```shellpoetry add --group dev &lt;python package name&gt;```### Run tests```shellpoetry run poe test```### Run project locally in JupyterTo run the project locally in Jupyter run:```shellpoetry run poe jupyter```A Jupyter instance should open in your browser. Open and run the cells in the `demo.ipynb` file.### Bumping versionUse `make` to bump the *patch*, *minor* version or *major* version before creating a pull request to the `main` GIT branch.Or run a poe task like this:```shellpoetry run poe bump-patch-version```You can use either `bump-version-patch`, `bump-version-minor`, or `bump-version-major`.Bumping must be done with a clean git working space, and automatically commits with the new version number.Then just run `git push origin --tags` to push the changes and trigger the release process.### Building and releasingBefore merging your changes into the `main` branch, make sure you have bumped the version like outlined above.An automatic release process will build *dapla-toolbelt* upon pull request-creation, merges, and direct commits to the`main` GIT branch. It will also release a new version of the package to **pypi.org** automatically when a commit is tagged, for example by a GitHub release.### Building and releasing manuallyRun `make build` to build a wheel and a source distribution.Run `make release-validate` to do all that AND validate it for release.Run this (replacing &lt;SEMVER&gt; with your current version number) to check the contents of your wheel:`tar tzf dist/dapla-toolbelt-&lt;SEMVER&gt;.tar.gz`#### Test releaseYou have to bump the version of the package (see documentation on &quot;Bumping version&quot; above) before releasing, because even test.pypi.org does not allow re-releases of a previously released version.Run the following command in order to build, validate, and test package publication by uploading to TestPyPI:`make release-test`You will have to manually enter a username and password for a user registered to [test.pypi.org](https://test.pypi.org) in order for this to work.#### Production release**NB: A manual production release should only be done as a last resort**, if the regular CI/CD pipeline does not work, and it's necessary to release regardless.You have to bump the version of the package (see documentation on &quot;Bumping version&quot; above) to something different from the last release before releasing.In order to publish a new version of the package to PyPI for real, run `make release`. Authenticate by manually entering your [pypi.org](https://pypi.org) username and password. </longdescription>

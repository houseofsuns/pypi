	<longdescription># TransitFit[TransitFit](https://transitfit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) has been developed as part of the ongoing effort of the Spectroscopy and Photometry of Exoplanet Atmospheres Research Network (SPEARNET). [SPEARNET](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stz783) is undertaking a survey of exoplanet atmospheres using transmission spectroscopy.**Original Author** - Joshua Hayes (Univ. Manchester)**Current maintainer** - Akshay Priyadarshi (Univ Manchester)## OverviewTransitFit is designed for exoplanetary transmission spectroscopy studies and offers a flexible approach to fitting single or multiple transits of an exoplanet at different observation wavelengths.  It possesses the functionality to efficiently couple host limb-darkening parameters to a range of physical models across different wavelengths, through the use of the [Limb darkening toolkit (ldtk)](https://github.com/hpparvi/ldtk) and the [Kipping parameterisations of two-parameter limb darkening models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0009). TransitFit uses [batman](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~lkreidberg/batman/index.html) to handle transit light curve modelling, and sampling and retrieval uses the nested sampling algorithm available through [dynesty](https://dynesty.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).&lt;a name=&quot;installation&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;## InstallationPlease note that TransitFit currently only runs on UNIX-based machines.Along with an installation of Python 3 (with the standard Conda distribution packages), TransitFit requires the following packages to be installed:- [dynesty](https://dynesty.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)- [batman](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~lkreidberg/batman/index.html)- [Limb darkening toolkit (ldtk)](https://github.com/hpparvi/ldtk)&lt;a name=&quot;guide&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;## User guideThe documentation for TransitFit can be found [here](https://transitfit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)&lt;a name=&quot;citing&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;## Citing TransitFitIf you have used TransitFit in your work, please cite the [accompanying paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210312139H/abstract).

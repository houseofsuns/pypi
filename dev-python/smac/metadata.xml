The main core consists of Bayesian Optimization in combination with an aggressive racing mechanism to efficiently decide which of two configurations performs better.SMAC3 is written in Python3 and continuously tested with Python 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Its RandomForest is written in C++. In further texts, SMAC is representatively mentioned for SMAC3.&gt; [Documentation](https://automl.github.io/SMAC3)&gt; [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/automl/projects/5/views/2)## Important: Changes in v2.0With the next big major release of SMAC, we drastically boosted the user experience by improving the APIs and how the pipelining is done (see [changelog](CHANGELOG.md)). All facades/intensifiers support multi-objective, multi-fidelity, and multi-threading natively now! That includes having an ask-and-tell interface and continuing a runwherever you left off. pSMAC is removed because when specifying the number of workers, SMAC automatically uses multi-threading for evaluating trials. When cleaning the code base, however, we removed the command-line interface (calling a target function from a script is still supported), and runtime optimization. Also,python 3.7 is not supported anymore. If you depend on those functionalities, please keep using v1.4.We are excited to introduce the new major release and look forward to developing new features on the new code base. We hope you enjoy this new user experience as much as we do. 🚀## InstallationThis instruction is for the installation on a Linux system, for Windows and Mac and further information see the [documentation](https://automl.github.io/SMAC3/main/1_installation.html).Create a new environment with python 3.10 and make sure swig is installed either on your system orinside the environment. We demonstrate the installation via anaconda in the following:Create and activate environment:```conda create -n SMAC python=3.10conda activate SMAC```Install swig:```conda install gxx_linux-64 gcc_linux-64 swig```Install SMAC via PyPI:```pip install smac```If you want to contribute to SMAC, use the following steps instead:```git clone https://github.com/automl/SMAC3.git &amp;&amp; cd SMAC3make install-dev```## Minimal Example```pyfrom ConfigSpace import Configuration, ConfigurationSpaceimport numpy as npfrom smac import HyperparameterOptimizationFacade, Scenariofrom sklearn import datasetsfrom sklearn.svm import SVCfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_scoreiris = datasets.load_iris()def train(config: Configuration, seed: int = 0) -&gt; float:    classifier = SVC(C=config[&quot;C&quot;], random_state=seed)    scores = cross_val_score(classifier, iris.data, iris.target, cv=5)    return 1 - np.mean(scores)configspace = ConfigurationSpace({&quot;C&quot;: (0.100, 1000.0)})# Scenario object specifying the optimization environmentscenario = Scenario(configspace, deterministic=True, n_trials=200)# Use SMAC to find the best configuration/hyperparameterssmac = HyperparameterOptimizationFacade(scenario, train)incumbent = smac.optimize()```More examples can be found in the [documentation](https://automl.github.io/SMAC3/main/examples/).## Visualization via DeepCAVEWith DeepCAVE ([Repo](https://github.com/automl/DeepCAVE), [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03493)) you can visualize your SMAC runs. It is a visualization and analysis tool for AutoML (especially for the sub-problemhyperparameter optimization) runs.## LicenseThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modifyit under the terms of the 3-clause BSD license (please see the LICENSE file).This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty ofMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.You should have received a copy of the 3-clause BSD licensealong with this program (see LICENSE file).If not, see [here](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).## Contacting usIf you have trouble using SMAC, a concrete question or found a bug, please create an [issue](https://github.com/automl/SMAC3/issues).

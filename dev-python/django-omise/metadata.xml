Currently, we support the following features:- Creating a customer- Allowing customer to add/delete credit/debit cards- Collect payments with new card with the option to keep the card- Collect payments with saved cards- Collect payments with [Internet Banking](https://www.omise.co/internet-banking)- Collect payments with [TrueMoney Wallet](https://www.omise.co/truemoney-wallet)- Collect payments with [Promptpay](https://www.omise.co/promptpay)- Collect payments with [Rabbit LINE Pay](https://www.omise.co/rabbit-linepay)- Webhook handler, saving raw data as an Event object and update related objects, currently supporting  - Customer  - Card  - Charge  - Source  - Refund  - Schedule  - Scheduled Charge  - Schedule Occurrence- 3DS pending charges handlingSee the [roadmap](#roadmap-and-contributions) for the plan of this project. Contributions are welcome!### Quick start---1. Add &quot;django_omise&quot; to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this:```    INSTALLED_APPS = [        ...        &quot;django_omise&quot;,    ]```2. Include the django_omise URLconf in your project urls.py like this:```    path(&quot;payments/&quot;, include(&quot;django_omise.urls&quot;)),```3. Add Omise keys and operating mode in settings.py:```pythonOMISE_PUBLIC_KEY = xxxxOMISE_SECRET_KEY = xxxxOMISE_LIVE_MODE = True | FalseOMISE_CHARGE_RETURN_HOST = localhost:8000# Optional. The default payment method is credit/debit card only.# You must specify additional payment methods.OMISE_PAYMENT_METHODS = [    &quot;card&quot;,    &quot;internet_banking&quot;, # Internet Banking    &quot;truemoney_wallet&quot;, # TrueMoney Wallet    &quot;promptpay&quot;, # Promptpay    &quot;rabbit_linepay&quot;, # Rabbit LINE Pay]```4. Run `python manage.py migrate` to create the Omise models.5. Add Omise endpoint webhook url `https://www.your-own-domain.com/payments/webhook/`### Basic usage---1. Create an Omise customer from User:   ```python   from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model   from django_omise.models.core import Customer   User = get_user_model()   user = User.objects.first()   customer = Customer.get_or_create(user=user)   ```2. Add card to Customer   2.1 With the built-in view (Recommended)   We have built a basic card collecting view where logged in users can add and remove their cards. Run Django server and visit _/payments/payment_methods/_ to see it in action. You could override the template used in the view by creating a new template in your project's directory _/templates/django_omise/manage_payment_methods.html_.   2.2 Manually   ```python   from django_omise.models.core import Customer   from django_omise.omise import omise   omise_token = omise.Token.retrieve(token_id)   Customer.objects.live().first().add_card(token=omise_token)   ```3. Charge a customer (Currently supporting new/saved cards, [Internet Banking](https://www.omise.co/internet-banking), [TrueMoney Wallet](https://www.omise.co/truemoney-wallet), [Promptpay](https://www.omise.co/promptpay))   3.1 With the build-in mixin   This package comes with a built-in mixin, with which you can create a class-based-view and write a few methods to charge a customer. See below for an example or see [Example 1](./examples/):   ```python   from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin   from django_omise.mixins import CheckoutMixin   from django_omise.models.choices import Currency   # Your own class-based-view   class CheckoutView(LoginRequiredMixin, CheckoutMixin):       template_name = &quot;yourapp/template.html&quot;       success_url = ...       def get_charge_details(self):           return {               &quot;amount&quot;: 100000,               &quot;currency&quot;: Currency.THB,           }       def process_charge_and_form(self, charge, form):           if charge.status in [ChargeStatus.SUCCESSFUL, ChargeStatus.PENDING]:               # Create new order and attach a charge object               # And handle form data               handle_form_data(form.cleaned_data)   ```   3.2 Manually   ```python   from django_omise.models.choices import Currency, ChargeStatus   from django_omise.models.core import Customer   customer = Customer.objects.first()   card = customer.cards.live().first()   charge = customer.charge_with_card(       amount=100000,       currency=Currency.THB,       card=card,   )   if charge.status == ChargeStatus.SUCCESSFUL:       # Do something   elif charge.status == ChargeStatus.FAILED:       # Do something else   ```4. Create a charge schedule for a customer:At the moment, you can create a new schedule for a customer manually by calling the method create_schedule from a Custoemr object. See below for an example:```pythonimport datetimefrom django_omise.models.choices import Currencyfrom django_omise.models.core import Customercustomer = Customer.objects.first()card = customer.default_cardcustomer.create_schedule(    amount=100000,    currency=Currency.THB,    card=card,    every=1,    period=&quot;month&quot;,    start_date=datetime.date(year=2022, month=5, day=22),    end_date=datetime.date(year=2032, month=5, day=22),    on={        'days_of_month': [22],    },    description=&quot;Monthly subscription&quot;,)```### Roadmap and contributions---Here are our immediate plans for this package, and more will be added!

	<longdescription># toopazo_toolsThis is the repository for the pip module ```https://pypi.org/project/toopazo-tools/```It consists of python package for common file-processing tasks## How to update a new version to https://pypi.org/  This is note to myself about the necessary steps to upload a new version of the code to the repo in https://pypi.org/.I wrote a bash file to automate the update and uploading process to pypi. It is can be executed in the terminal using```. ./update_library.sh```The steps involved are taken from https://widdowquinn.github.io/coding/update-pypi-package/1. Update local packages for distribution    ```    python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade setuptools wheel    python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade twine     ```2. Open setup.py and change the version, e.g., version='1.0.3'.    This can be done automatically by running    ```   python increment_setup_version.py   ```3. It is sometimes neccessary to delete the build/ and dist/ folder    ```    rm -r build/*    rm -r dist/*    ```4. Create distribution packages on your local machine, and checkthe dist/ directory for the new version files    ```    python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel    ```5. Upload the distribution files to https://pypi.org/ server    ```    python3 -m twine upload dist/*    ```6. Install the package from https://pypi.org/ server    ```    python3 -m pip install -U toopazo-tools    ```</longdescription>

	<longdescription># ccfit2`ccfit2` is a package for working with magnetometry data, specifically those from AC susceptibility, DC decay, and DC Waveform measurements.Although the main use of `ccfit2` is to extract and later fit temperature/field dependent relaxation rate data from these experiments, the modular natureof `ccfit2` means that the user is free to include any of `ccfit2`'s functionality in their own work.## Documentation and InstallationTo get started, head to the online documentation for `ccfit2` [here](https://chilton-group.gitlab.io/cc-fit2/).## ReferenceWe request that any data processed with ccfit2 is accompanied by **both** of the following citations1.

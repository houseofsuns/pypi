	<longdescription>[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/facebookincubator/submitit.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/facebookincubator/workflows/submitit)[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)[![Pypi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/submitit)](https://pypi.org/project/submitit/)[![conda-forge](https://img.shields.io/conda/vn/conda-forge/submitit)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/submitit)# Submit it!## What is submitit?Submitit is a lightweight tool for submitting Python functions for computation within a Slurm cluster.It basically wraps submission and provide access to results, logs and more.[Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/quickstart.html) is an open source, fault-tolerant, and highly scalable cluster management and job scheduling system for large and small Linux clusters.Submitit allows to switch seamlessly between executing on Slurm or locally.### An example is worth a thousand words: performing an additionFrom inside an environment with `submitit` installed:```pythonimport submititdef add(a, b):    return a + b# executor is the submission interface (logs are dumped in the folder)executor = submitit.AutoExecutor(folder=&quot;log_test&quot;)# set timeout in min, and partition for running the jobexecutor.update_parameters(timeout_min=1, slurm_partition=&quot;dev&quot;)job = executor.submit(add, 5, 7)  # will compute add(5, 7)print(job.job_id)  # ID of your joboutput = job.result()  # waits for completion and returns outputassert output == 12  # 5 + 7 = 12...  your addition was computed in the cluster```The `Job` class also provides tools for reading the log files (`job.stdout()` and `job.stderr()`).If what you want to run is a command, turn it into a Python function using `submitit.helpers.CommandFunction`, then submit it.By default stdout is silenced in `CommandFunction`, but it can be unsilenced with `verbose=True`.**Find more examples [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/submitit/blob/1.4.5/docs/examples.md)!!!**Submitit is a Python 3.6+ toolbox for submitting jobs to Slurm.It aims at running python function from python code.## InstallQuick install, in a virtualenv/conda environment where `pip` is installed (check `which pip`):- stable release:  ```  pip install submitit  ```- stable release using __conda__:  ```  conda install -c conda-forge submitit  ```- main branch:  ```  pip install git+https://github.com/facebookincubator/submitit@main#egg=submitit  ```You can try running the [MNIST example](https://github.com/facebookincubator/submitit/blob/1.4.5/docs/mnist.py) to check that everything is working as expected (requires sklearn).## DocumentationSee the following pages for more detailled information:- [Examples](https://github.com/facebookincubator/submitit/blob/1.4.5/docs/examples.md): for a bunch of examples dealing with errors, concurrency, multi-tasking etc...- [Structure and main objects](https://github.com/facebookincubator/submitit/blob/1.4.5/docs/structure.md): to get a better understanding of how `submitit` works, which files are created for each job, and the main objects you will interact with.- [Checkpointing](https://github.com/facebookincubator/submitit/blob/1.4.5/docs/checkpointing.md): to understand how you can configure your job to get checkpointed when preempted and/or timed-out.- [Tips and caveats](https://github.com/facebookincubator/submitit/blob/1.4.5/docs/tips.md): for a bunch of information that can be handy when working with `submitit`.- [Hyperparameter search with nevergrad](https://github.com/facebookincubator/submitit/blob/1.4.5/docs/nevergrad.md): basic example of `nevergrad` usage and how it interfaces with `submitit`.### GoalsThe aim of this Python3 package is to be able to launch jobs on Slurm painlessly from *inside Python*, using the same submission and job patterns than the standard library package `concurrent.futures`:Here are a few benefits of using this lightweight package: - submit any function, even lambda and script-defined functions. - raises an error with stack trace if the job failed. - requeue preempted jobs (Slurm only) - swap between `submitit` executor and one of `concurrent.futures` executors in a line, so that it is easy to run your code either on slurm, or locally with multithreading for instance. - checkpoints stateful callables when preempted or timed-out and requeue from current state (advanced feature). - easy access to task local/global rank for multi-nodes/tasks jobs. - same code can work for different clusters thanks to a plugin system.Submitit is used by FAIR researchers on the FAIR cluster.The defaults are chosen to make their life easier, and might not be ideal for every cluster.### Non-goals- a commandline tool for running slurm jobs. Here, everything happens inside Python. To this end, you can however use [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/)'s [submitit plugin](https://hydra.cc/docs/next/plugins/submitit_launcher) (version &gt;= 1.0.0).- a task queue, this only implements the ability to launch tasks, but does not schedule them in any way.- being used in Python2! This is a Python3.6+ only package :)### Comparison with dask.distributed[`dask`](https://distributed.dask.org/en/latest/) is a nice framework for distributed computing. `dask.distributed` provides the same `concurrent.futures` executor API as `submitit`:```pythonfrom distributed import Clientfrom dask_jobqueue import SLURMClustercluster = SLURMCluster(processes=1, cores=2, memory=&quot;2GB&quot;)cluster.scale(2)  # this may take a few seconds to launchexecutor = Client(cluster)executor.submit(...)```The key difference with `submitit` is that `dask.distributed` distributes the jobs to a pool of workers (see the `cluster` variable above) while `submitit` jobs are directly jobs on the cluster. In that sense `submitit` is a lower level interface than `dask.distributed` and you get more direct control over your jobs, including individual `stdout` and `stderr`, and possibly checkpointing in case of preemption and timeout. On the other hand, you should avoid submitting multiple small tasks with `submitit`, which would create many independent jobs and possibly overload the cluster, while you can do it without any problem through `dask.distributed`.## ContributorsBy chronological order: Jérémy Rapin, Louis Martin, Lowik Chanussot, Lucas Hosseini, Fabio Petroni, Francisco Massa, Guillaume Wenzek, Thibaut Lavril, Vinayak Tantia, Andrea Vedaldi, Max Nickel, Quentin Duval (feel free to [contribute](https://github.com/facebookincubator/submitit/blob/1.4.5/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) and add your name ;) )## LicenseSubmitit is released under the [MIT License](https://github.com/facebookincubator/submitit/blob/1.4.5/LICENSE).</longdescription>

	<longdescription>### **PyPassFusion Documentation**___**Introduction**I developed this password generating program using Python to provide users with a simple yet efficient way to:- Generate a brand new password for any platform of their choosing.- - Add already existing passwords.- - Save all generated or customized passwords, along with the title of the platform they're being used on, as a text file at the user's specified destination.- - You can then access your passwords by searching for this (.txt) file on your Windows/Linux or macOs system.**Installation**You can install this program by opening your Terminal and typing in â€œ`pip install pypassfusion` or `pip3 install pypassfusion`â€œ.After installation is completed, you can start using it by simply typing in â€œpyfusionâ€ and hitting enter.**Utilization**You will then see this menu:![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72671131/228978212-0eb717fd-0b28-4366-ba0e-fd9adaa2f209.png)If you want to generate a new password, you will type in â€œ1â€œ and hit enter. the program will then ask you these 3 questions:![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72671131/228978507-267adcc1-9d74-4894-a32a-bb4123f272c1.png)After answering all of them to your preference, your password will be generated! then youâ€™ll be provided with the menu again:![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72671131/228978646-4d88f055-675d-48cd-b6c0-aae5cda057d4.png)If you want to see the generated password, you enter â€œ3â€œ:![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72671131/228978771-cf92350b-c26b-48d4-b33f-b2f7b0fec3ed.png)If you want to save the generated password, you enter â€œ4â€œ:![5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72671131/228978854-0fb5fc23-9350-4a70-b076-fdf7f0ae5654.png)Here you choose a name for your (.txt) file and the path you have in mind for this file.Then hit save:![6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72671131/228978991-e8ee2bfb-78c7-42ec-9264-6260ec10a28a.png)The last step is to choose a title for this specific password you just generated, for example: Gmail.After that your new password will be successfully saved to its destination!![7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72671131/228979070-33f92aa4-fa8c-4c68-b023-76d869bba4aa.png)You will then find this (.txt) file at its designated spot on your system:![8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72671131/228979144-ddfc8eeb-2e9f-4b29-a51a-1d37ddedcd91.png)Any other password you add yourself or generate using the program can be either added to this existing file or a new one.**here is how you can add your own password:**First you need to choose option â€œ2â€œHere youâ€™ll see a sub-menu:![9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72671131/228979318-9a06ef56-07cb-4b8b-a33a-5c5a9a691c57.png)You can type in your customized password by choosing option â€œ1â€œ.![10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72671131/228979398-97db7073-7496-43c4-94f6-62ffa610359d.png)Your password has now been added, by choosing â€œ2â€œ you will see the password you just added and by choosing â€œ3â€œ you proceed to save your own password as a text file like so:![11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72671131/228979487-740769c4-532e-4636-8f4e-f63ccff997ad.png)![12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72671131/228979562-11f5c593-4fe4-4b9d-924d-d76efb9ae97b.png)![13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72671131/228979565-496cbc3a-f950-4501-a5a4-a073f0659e08.png)This is what youâ€™ll then see in your previously made (.txt) file:![14](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72671131/228979625-ac444c86-dfb1-4fb6-a926-d946056fa38b.png)As you follow these steps and continue on using the program this list of passwords will expand.And thatâ€™s it! hope you enjoy using this CLI. Also let me know if you have any suggestions or if youâ€™re interested in making a contribution.___**P.S   Iâ€™ll be adding the GUI of this program in the near future.**</longdescription>

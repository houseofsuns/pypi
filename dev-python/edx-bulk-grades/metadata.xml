This adds models and an API for reading and modifyingscores and grades in bulk.Overview---------The ``README.rst`` file should then provide an overview of the code in thisrepository, including the main components and useful entry points for startingto understand the code in more detail.edx-bulk-grades is a library that runs under lms. It uses the configuration settings defined in lms as well.In order to use, the library must be installed into edx-platform.Using with Docker Devstack--------------------------Prerequisite: Have your Open edX https://github.com/openedx/devstack properly installed.Note: When you see &quot;from inside the lms&quot; below, it means that you've run ``make lms-shell`` from your devstack directoryand are on a command prompt inside the LMS container.1. | Clone this repo into ``../src/`` directory (relative to your &quot;devstack&quot; repo location). This will mount the directory   | in a way that is accessible to the lms container.2. From inside the lms, uninstall bulk-grades and reinstall your local copy. You can just copy the following line::    pip uninstall edx-bulk-grades -y; pip install -e /edx/src/edx-bulk-grades   Or, you can run the following make command::    make install-local3. Now, get your bulk-grades development environment set up::    cd /edx/src/edx-bulk-grades    virtualenv edx-bulk-grades-env    source edx-bulk-grades-env/bin/activate    make requirementsMaking Code Changes-------------------1. | After checking out a new branch, increment ``__version__`` by the smallest possible value located in ``bulk_grades/__init__.py``.   | This will allow edx-platform to pick up the new version.2. | Once a branch has been merged, it is necessary to make a release on github, specifying the new version from   | ``__version__`` set above.3. In order for platform to use the newest version of bulk-grades, it is necessary to run the::    $ make upgradefrom docker shell of edx-platform. This will increment the version of edx-bulk-grades to the correct one.4. Once the code from step 3 is merged, this will trigger deployment of the correct versions of edx platform and bulk-grades.Unit Testing------------mock_apps folder: Since bulk_grades depends on platform during actual runtime, for unit tests, we need to mock variousendpoints and calls. To this end, they are mocked in the mock_apps folder.Since edx-bulk grades runs under platform, it is necessary to connect to platform docker::    $ make lms-shellfollowed by::    $ cd /edx/src/edx-bulk-grades    make testThis will run the unit tests and code coverage numbersLicense-------The code in this repository is licensed under the AGPL 3.0 unlessotherwise noted.Please see ``LICENSE.txt`` for details.How To Contribute-----------------Contributions are very welcome.Please read `How To Contribute &lt;https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst&gt;`_ for details.Even though they were written with ``edx-platform`` in mind, the guidelinesshould be followed for Open edX code in general.The pull request description template should be automatically applied if you are creating a pull request from GitHub.

This is a dependency of `motmot`.  * [meshio](https://github.com/nschloe/meshio):    Reads and writes a multitude of mesh formats.  * [pymesh](https://github.com/taxpon/pymesh):    Reads and writes STL and OBJ files.* Mesh analysis:  * [PyMesh](https://github.com/PyMesh/PyMesh):    A highly sophisticated mesh library which unfortunately depends on some    rather    hairy C++ libraries, making it not generally installable.    It's not even on PyPI.  * [trimesh](https://github.com/mikedh/trimesh):    Another general purpose mesh library. This one is pure Python and focuses    strictly on triangular and preferably closed meshes.    It also brings a few readers and writers with it.    This library is very powerful.    It's quite likely that you'd be better off using it instead of `motmot`.* Mesh cleaning:  * [quad_mesh_simplify](https://github.com/jannessm/quadric-mesh-simplification):    Decimate (collapse redundant or near redundant vertices in) meshes to make    the filesize much smaller with negligible impact on quality.  * [Py_Fast-Quadric-Mesh-Simplification](https://github.com/Kramer84/Py_Fast-Quadric-Mesh-Simplification):    Another mesh decimator. This one is much faster but not on PyPI (yet).### UsageThe basic API for ``motmot`` is modelled off that of [numpy-stl] with a fewalterations.#### InitialisationMeshes can be :1.  Constructed from scratch using a single *vectors* array.    This array should be 3D with shape ``(n, k, 3)`` where:    * ``n`` is the number of polygons in the mesh,    * ``k`` is the number of corners each polygon has,    * ``3`` corresponds to having 3 axes. i.e. ``x``, ``y`` and ``z``.    ```python    # vectors is a (n, 3, 3) numpy array.    triangle_mesh = Mesh(vectors)    # vectors is a (n, 4, 3) numpy array.    square_mesh = Mesh(vectors)    ```2.  Or using the more memory efficient *vertices + faces* form.    ```python    # `vertices` is an array of points. It should contain no duplicates.    # `faces` is an integer array indicating which vertices are used to construct    # each polygon.    mesh = Mesh(vertices, faces)    ```3.  Read from an STL file. This uses [numpy-stl] under the hood.    Currently, STL is the only file format that `motmot` will read implicitly:    ```python    from motmot import Mesh    mesh = Mesh(&quot;some-file.stl&quot;)    ```4.  Read from an lzma, gzip or bzip2 compressed STL file:    ```python    from motmot import Mesh    # An lzma compressed STL file. Create using `xz some-file.stl` in bash.    mesh = Mesh(&quot;some-file.stl.xz&quot;)    # A gzip compressed STL file. Create using `gzip some-file.stl` in bash.    mesh = Mesh(&quot;some-file.stl.gz&quot;)    # A bzip2 compressed STL file. Create using `bzip2 some-file.stl` in bash.    mesh = Mesh(&quot;some-file.stl.bz2&quot;)    ```5.  Stream from any subclass of ``io.RawIOBase``.    From here you can read from arbitrary sources such as    embedded files, streams, archives or other pseudo files.    For example, the following reads an STL directly from a web request:    ```python    from urllib import request    from motmot import Mesh    # Pull an STL file from the internet and load it without an intermediate    # temporary file.    url = &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bwoodsend/vtkplotlib/master/&quot; \          &quot;vtkplotlib/data/models/rabbit/rabbit.stl&quot;    with request.urlopen(url) as req:        mesh = Mesh(req)    ```#### Vertices + Faces meshes vs Vectors meshesThere are two forms of mesh.1.  A *vectors* mesh is essentially a list of polygons where    each polygon is a list of points (its corners) and    each point is an ``(x, y, z)`` triplet.    This form is simple but wasteful because points which appear in multiple    polygons are written multiple times which wastes memory and rendering time.2.  A *vertices+faces* mesh takes all the unique points from a *vectors* mesh,    calling them the *vertices*, then replaces each point in *vectors* with its    index from *vertices*, calling this *faces*.    Note that *faces* is often also known as *facets* or *polygons*.Motmot makes the two forms interchangeable.Each of *vectors*, *vertices* and *faces* are all available as attributes on allmeshes but,depending on how a mesh is constructed,*vectors* may be internally derived from *vertices* and *faces* or vice-versa.```pythonimport numpy as npfrom motmot import Mesh# Define the 8 vertices in a cuboid.vertices = np.array([    [0., 0., 0.],    [3., 0., 0.],    [0., 5., 0.],    [3., 5., 0.],    [0., 0., 9.],    [3., 0., 9.],    [0., 5., 9.],    [3., 5., 9.],])# Define the 6 sides of a cube or cuboid.faces = np.array([    # Draw a square using vertices[6], vertices[2], vertices[0] and vertices[4]    [6, 2, 0, 4],    # Draw a square using vertices[0], vertices[1], vertices[5] and vertices[4]    [0, 1, 5, 4],    # And so on...

	<longdescription>---title: MathTextapp_file: app.pysdk: gradiosdk_version: 3.15.0license: agpl-3.0---## MathText NLUNatural Language Understanding for math symbols, digits, and words with a Gradio user interface and REST API.## Setup your Python environmentLaunch a `terminal` on linux (or the `git-bash` application on Windows).Then create a virtualenv with whatever python version you have available on your system.Any python version greater than `3.7` should work.Most of us on Linux systems use Python `3.9`: ```bashgit clone git@gitlab.com:tangibleai/community/mathtextcd mathtextpip install --upgrade virtualenv poetrypython -m virtualenv .venvls -hal```You should see a new `.venv/` directory.It will contain your python interpreter and a few `site-packages` like `pip` and `distutils`.Now activate your new virtual environment by sourcing `.venv/bin/activate` (on Linux) or `.venv/scripts/activate` (on Windows).```bashsource .venv/bin/activate || source .venv/scripts/activate```## Developer installationOnce you have a shiny new virtual environment activated you can install the `mathtext` in `--editable` mode.This way, when you edit the files and have the package change immediately.Make sure you are already within your cloned `mathtext` project directory.And makes sure your virtual environment is activated.You should see the name of your virtual environment in parentheses within your command line prompt, like `(.venv) $`.Then when you install MathText it will be available to any other application within that environment.```bashpip install --editable .```## User installationIf you don't want to contribute to the MathText source code and you just want to import and run the MathText modules, you can install it from a binary wheel on PyPi.```bashpip install mathtext```## Usage### Sentiment classification### Directory structure with notes```textmathtext    mathtext: mathtext code        data: training and test sets for various tasks        models: scripts to create models and store in/retrieve from object storage        utils: utility functions            checkers.py: T/F evaluations            converters.py: Change the data type from one to another            extractors.py: Looks for specific values or value types in a message            formatters.py: Attempts to format text in a standardized way        api_gradio.py: gradio api        predict_intent.py: functions to run multilabel recognizer on message        text_processing.py: evaluations that use sequences of utils    scripts: setup scripts        api_scaling.sh: makes calls to local api        api_scaling.py: makes async http requests to the local api        build.sh        plot_calls.py: Functions for plotting data        pyproject.template    tests: various tests        __init.py        test_cases_all.py    .git*: various git files    app.py: ties all of the api components together for huggingface    LICENSE.md: license    pyproject.toml: pyproject file    README.md: this    requirements.txt: project dependencies```            </longdescription>

The library offers lightweight object-oriented interface to MongoDB as well as Pandas based data structures. The aim of the library is to provide extensive support for developing machine learning based applications with a focus on practicing clean code and modular design. ## FeaturesSome cool features that we are proud to mention are: ### Logging 1. configFromFiles: utility function to configure loggers according to configuration files, giving options to capture warnings and to define which logger to use to capture errors.2. WithLogging: Base class setting up the `logger` property defining a logger named according to the class to be used in descendant classes.### ConfigurationsOffers a unified framework to parse and store yaml configuration files: 1. get_confs_in_path: Retrieve all configuration files from system path, with given extension.2. merge_confs : merge given configuration files. 3. BaseConfig : Basic configuration class. This class implements utility methods to retrieve configuration sub-levels and values. An instance of this class can be updated merging other instances of the same class.4. Some pre-implemented configuration classes for some common use cases like: FileSystemConfig, LoggingConfig, MongoConfig and many more.## InstallationFrom pypi server```pip install py4ai-core```From source```git clone https://github.com/NicolaDonelli/py4ai-corecd py4ai-coremake install```## Tests ```make tests```## Checks To run predefined checks (unit-tests, linting checks, formatting checks and static typing checks):```make checks```## How to contribute ?

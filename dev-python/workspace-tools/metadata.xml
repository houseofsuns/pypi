	<longdescription>workspace-tools===============Tools to simplify working with multiple Python repositories by seamlessly integrating git and tox,where you can simply run one command instead of many native commands individually to do common tasks.It is mostly a wrapper on top of existing tools with the end goal of providing a simple, seamless,and less repetive experience when working with one or more repositories. Feature support is mostlylimited to what the author uses as, currently, it is foremost a personal tool to enhance theauthor's own productivity, but sharing it as others might find it useful.Overview========* One tool to seamlessly manage / integrate all workspace tools, from setup to publish.* Simplified command execution for common workflow - just run one command, instead of many individual native ones.* Command execution is also smart / optimized - e.g. test command auto detects requirement changes to redevelop.* Path aware context commands that run across all checkouts - e.g. see status / diff for all repos.* Get the most out of other products by easily updating your dependencies to the latest* Templates included to setup new product quickly* Support for multiple branches with child/parent relationship.* Cool and sensible shortcut aliases to help you do more by typing less - you will love &quot;tv&quot; [if you know ag]!Quick Start Tutorial====================First, install it with::    sudo pip3 install autopip    app install workspace-toolsSecond, optionally setup environment with bash functions/aliases:.. code-block:: console    $ cd ~/workspace    $ wst setup --commands-with-aliases    [INFO] Added &quot;ws&quot; bash function with workspace directory set to ~/workspace    [INFO] Added bash functions: bump, checkout, clean, commit, log, publish, push, status, test, update    [INFO] Added aliases: co=checkout, ci=commit, di=diff, st=status, up=update    [INFO] Added special aliases: a='activate', d='deactivate',           tv='open_files_from_last_command'  # from ag/ack/grep/find/which [t]o [v]im    [INFO] To use, run &quot;source ~/.wstrc&quot; or open a new shell.    $ source ~/.wstrcThen witness the awesome power of workspace-tools:.. code-block:: console    $ ws    # Runs `cd ~/workspace &amp;&amp; ls`    aiohttp-requests               localconfig              python-examples    ansible-hostmanager            pytest-fixtures          utils-core    ...    $ cd localconfig    # Use your favorite editor to make some changes    $ ci -tp 'This adds/commits all files, runs style check/tests with coverage, and then pushes to all remotes!'

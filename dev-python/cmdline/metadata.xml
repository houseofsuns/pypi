	<longdescription># cmdlineThe cmdline package provides a standard way to specify and override command settings and logging configuration.  Using cmdline setttings is as simple as creating a `settings.yml`:```REMOTE_ADDR:  default: 'https://example.com/'  help: the remote address```and compiling the settings in your main program:```from cmdline import SettingsParser, settingsdef main():    SettingsParser.compile_settings()    remote = settings.REMOTE_ADDR    print('remote addr:', remote)if __name__ == '__main__':    sys.exit(main())```Your program can then be called in any of the following ways:```$ remoteremote addr: https://example.com/$ export REMOTE_ADDR=https://env.example.com/$ remoteremote addr: https://env.example.com/$ remote --remote-addr=https://arg-takes-precedence.example.com/remote addr: https://arg-takes-precedence.example.com/```## Installation```pip install cmdline```## SettingsSettings are configured in an overlaid fashion starting with a root configuration packaged with the application.  Standard [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) options are used to configure settings.### Override defaultsThe packaged settings can be overridden by additional settings files on the filesystem, environment variables, and finally command line arguments.  For a command named `remote` order in which they are applied are:- packaged settings- &lt;sys.prefix&gt;/etc/remote/settings.yml- ~/.remote/settings.yml- environment variables- command line argumentsEnvironment variables map exactly to the name of the setting, i.e. the environment variable `REMOTE_ADDR` configures the `REMOTE_ADDR` setting.Command line arguments are lowercase-dashed versions of the setting, for instance, the command line argument `--remote-addr` configures the `REMOTE_ADDR` setting.### SubcommandsThe settings parser supports [argparse subcommands](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#sub-commands).  A setting can be configured to be for a subcommand by adding a `_subcommand` key to the setting's options.  For example:```COPY_FORCE  default: no  _subcommand: copy```The `_SUBCOMMAND` setting contains the name of the subcommand the command was run with.### DocumentationCommand descriptions and help text can be added in a `_COMMANDS` section.  The `_main` will set the description for the main program.  Any other keys will correspond to a subcommand by the same name.  For example, below sets the description for the main program and the description and help text for the `copy` subcommand:```_COMMANDS:  _main:    description: &gt;      this is main description and can be a very long string      that covers multiple lines  copy:    description: &gt;      this is copy subcommand description and can be a very long string      that covers multiple lines    help: copy files```### Type conversionSettings can be converted to a particular type using argparse's `type` setting.  For example setting `type: int` will convert the setting into an integer.  This is done by using Python's built-in `int()` function.When `type` is a dotted string, the given function will be imported and used.  For example, setting `type: convesion.convert_bool` will call the `convert_bool()` function in the [conversion](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/conversion) package.## LoggingSimilarly, logging is configured through Python's `logging.config.dictConfig()` function.  More info on dictconfig is at [docs.python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.config.html#logging.config.dictConfig); an example is below.  This configuration sets a `console` handler that sends logs to stdout and a `null` handler that throws away logs.  The default logging configuration is to log WARN level and higher messages to the console, which is setup by the `root` logger, and two additional loggers are configured for the `mypkg.foo` and `mypkg.bar` loggers, where the loglevel for `mypkg.foo` is set to DEBUG and `mypkg.bar` is thrown out altogether.```version: 1disable_existing_loggers: Falseformatters:  simple:    format: &quot;%(asctime)s %(name)s:%(lineno)d %(levelname)s %(message)s&quot;handlers:  console:    class: logging.StreamHandler    level: WARN    formatter: simple    stream: ext://sys.stdout  &quot;null&quot;:    class: logging.NullHandlerloggers:  mypkg.foo:    level: DEBUG    handlers: [console]    propagate: no  mypkg.bar:    handlers: [&quot;null&quot;]    propagate: noroot:  level: WARN  handlers: [console]```Once the configuration is written, logging is configured by calling the `setup_logging()` function:```import loggingfrom cmdline import setup_loggingdef main():    setup_logging()    logging.getLogger(__name__).warning('ello')if __name__ == '__main__':    sys.exit(main())```### Log level environmentThe only logging configuration that can be updated outside the configuration file is the default log level, which can be changed with the environment variable `LOG_LEVEL`; for example, `LOG_LEVEL=debug remote`.## File locationCreate a directory named `config`.  In that directory, create the files `logconfig.yml` and `settings.yml`.  A bare-bones `setup.py` that installs these files correctly is below:```#!/usr/bin/env python import osfrom setuptools import setupdef get_data_files(base):    for dirpath, dirnames, filenames in os.walk(base):        for filename in filenames:            yield os.path.join(dirpath, filename)data_files = [    ('config', list(get_data_files('config'))),]setup(name='remote',      version='0.0.1',      packages=['remote'],      data_files=data_files,      entry_points = {          'console_scripts': [              'remote = remote.command:main',          ],      },)```The file structure for the `setup.py` above looks like:```root_dir/+- remote/|  +- __init__.py|  +- command.py+- config/|  +- logconfig.yml|  +- settings.yml+- setup.py```## Config root environment variableSetting the environment variable `CMDLINE_CONFIG_ROOT` will make the given path the primary config location for settings and logging.</longdescription>

	<longdescription># ChatGPContextMakerChatGPContextMaker is a command-line utility that concatenates files in a directory and its subdirectories into a single file. It is particularly useful when you want to provide an entire program as context to an AI like ChatGPT to work on code projects.# Features- Recursively concatenate files from a directory and its subdirectories- Provide a default output location (current working directory) and default output file name- Prevent overwriting existing files by appending the current datetime to the output file name- Easily installable and usable via pip and Poetry## Installation### Using pipYou can install ChatGPTContextMaker directly from PyPI using pip:```pip install gpcontext-maker```### Using PoetryAlternatively, you can install ChatGPTContextMaker using Poetry:1. Install Poetry, if you haven't already:```pip install poetry```2. Add ChatGPTContextMaker to your project's dependencies:```poetry add gpcontext-maker```## Usage### As a command-line toolTo use ChatGPContextMaker as a command-line tool, you can run the following command in your terminal:```python -m gpcontext-maker /path/to/input/directory -o /path/to/output/directory -f output_file_name```* `/path/to/input/directory`: The directory containing the files you want to concatenate* `/path/to/output/directory`: The directory where the concatenated file will be saved (default: current working directory)* `output_file_name`: The name of the output file (default: context)If a file with the same name already exists in the output directory, the current datetime will be appended to the output file name to prevent overwriting.### As a moduleYou can also use ChatGPTContextMaker as a module in your Python script:```from chatgpcontextmaker import concat_files_recursivesource_directory = &quot;/path/to/input/directory&quot;output_directory = &quot;/path/to/output/directory&quot;output_file_name = &quot;output_file_name&quot;output_file_path = os.path.join(output_directory, output_file_name)concat_files_recursive(source_directory, output_file_path)```Replace `/path/to/input/directory`, `/path/to/output/directory`, and `output_file_name` with the appropriate paths and file name for your use case. The `concat_files_recursive` function will concatenate the files from the input directory and its subdirectories and save the result in the specified output file.## Extending ChatGPTContextMakerYou can extend the functionality of ChatGPTContextMaker by modifying the `__main__.py` script in the chatgpcontextmaker package.To contribute to the project, simply fork the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/estill01/ChatGPContextMaker), make your changes, and submit a pull request.</longdescription>

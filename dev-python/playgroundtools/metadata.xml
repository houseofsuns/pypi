This also includes the ability to run these projects (called **playgrounds**) and delete them. This can be done either through the CLI or through the interactive GUI (with limited capabilities). The exact configuration for the creation and execution of these playgrounds are found [here](https://github.com/saibalusulapalem/playgroundtools/blob/main/playgroundtools/config.json), in the package's configuration file.For example, creating an `api` playground results in the following file structure:```cmdplayground│   .env│   main.py│   reset.py│   settings.json│├───.venv│       ...│├───api│       config.py│       crud.py│       database.py│       deps.py│       models.py│       schemas.py│       __init__.py│└───requirements        requirements.in```## Commands`new`:Creates a playground.```shell$ playground new [-h] [-i LIB [LIB ...]] [-v] -n NAME [-o OPTIONS] type```For example, to create an `api` project:```shell# We can specify a list of optional packages to install via pip by using the `-i` option$ playground new api -n my_api -i requests -v  # verbosity can be set with the -v option```A customized creation can be accomplished through use of the `-o` option. See [Configuration Formatting](#formatting) for more detail.```shell# `package` is a custom playground type$ playground new package -n my_package -o &quot;{\&quot;author\&quot;: \&quot;John Doe\&quot;}&quot;  # customization can be done via the `-o` option````run`:Runs a playground.```shell$ playground run [-h] [-m MODULE] [-a ARGS [ARGS ...]] name```For example:```shell$ playground run console_app````delete`:Deletes a playground.```shell$ playground delete [-h] name```For example:```shell$ playground delete jupyter_tests````config`:Reads or modifies the configuration. See the [Using the CLI](#using-the-cli) section for more detail.```shell$ playground config [-h] [-k READ] {delete,set}```For example:```shell$ playground config set -k api.folders -v &quot;[\&quot;api\&quot;, \&quot;api/routers\&quot;]&quot;```## Graphical User InterfaceInvoking `playground-gui` will open the interactive GUI, allowing for the creation and deletion of playgrounds.## Playground SettingsSettings for a playground can be configured via its `settings.json` file.The available options are:- `python`: a path that points to the Python installation used to run the playground.- `module`: the module to run (by invocation of `-m {module}`)- `args`: the arguments to pass to the module (`-m {module} {args ...}`)## ConfigurationTo configure the installation of `playgroundtools`, utilize the `config` command in the CLI or manually edit the [config.json](https://github.com/saibalusulapalem/playgroundtools/blob/main/playgroundtools/config.json) file.The available options are:- `folders`: a list of folders that should be placed inside the playground upon creation.- `files`: maps file names to lists containing the contents of the file by line.- `lib`: the packages to be installed upon creation of the playground.- `module`: the module to run when the playground is executed via `-m {module}`.- `args`: the arguments to pass to the module upon execution (`-m {module} {args ...}`).- (OPTIONAL) `format`: specifies strings that are used for interpolation (see below)### FormattingKeys and values can be interpolated using one of the strings below in the format `${string}` in the [config.json](https://github.com/saibalusulapalem/playgroundtools/blob/main/playgroundtools/config.json) file.- `name`: the playground name.Format strings can be customized to include common conventions. For instance, one can include an `author` key in the `format` section of their playground type to specify a default author when creating a package and reference it in the setup file of the playground by using `${author}`. An example of the usage of these format strings is shown below, in the [Using JSON](#using-json) section.Format strings also allow flexibility in the creation of playgrounds. You can override the default values for these strings when invoking the `new` command in the CLI by specifying the `-o` option, followed by JSON which determines the value for these fields upon creation.### Using the CLI`config delete`:Deletes a key from the configuration.```shell$ playground config delete [-h] [-k KEY] [-f FILE]```For example:```shell$ playground config delete &quot;package&quot;```Keys from a custom config file can also be deleted:```shell$ playground config delete -f user_config.json````config set`:Sets a key in the configuration.```shell$ playground config set [-h] [-k KEY] [-v VALUE] [-f FILE]```For example:```shell$ playground config set -k &quot;api.folders&quot; -v &quot;[\&quot;api\&quot;, \&quot;api/routers\&quot;, \&quot;api/db\&quot;]&quot;```Configuration can also be added from a custom JSON file:```shell$ playground config set -f user_config.json```### Using JSONThe [config.json](https://github.com/saibalusulapalem/playgroundtools/blob/main/playgroundtools/config.json) file simply contains configurations for different types of playgrounds. The settings for each type are specified by the available options aforementioned.For example, to create a `package` type, one could use:```jsonc{    // ...    &quot;package&quot;: {        &quot;folders&quot;: [            &quot;${name}&quot;,            &quot;tests&quot;        ],        &quot;files&quot;: {            &quot;setup.cfg&quot;: [                // File contents go here...            ],            &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;: [                // File contents go here...            ],            &quot;setup.py&quot;: [                // File contents go here...            ]            // ...        },        &quot;lib&quot;: [            &quot;${name}&quot;,            &quot;${formatter}&quot;,            &quot;${linter}&quot;,            &quot;${build}&quot;,            &quot;${upload}&quot;,            &quot;isort&quot;        ],        &quot;module&quot;: &quot;${name}&quot;,        &quot;args&quot;: [],        &quot;format&quot;: {            &quot;formatter&quot;: &quot;black&quot;,            &quot;build&quot;: &quot;build&quot;,            &quot;upload&quot;: &quot;twine&quot;,            &quot;linter&quot;: &quot;flake8&quot;        }    }}```</longdescription>

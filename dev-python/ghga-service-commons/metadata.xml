It is open source.# InstallationThis package is available at PyPI:https://pypi.org/project/ghga_service_commonsYou can install it from there using:```pip install ghga_service_commons```Thereby, you may specify following extra(s):- `api`: dependencies needed to use the API server functionalities- `auth`: dependencies needed for dealing with authentication and authorization## DevelopmentFor setting up the development environment, we rely on the[devcontainer feature](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) of vscode.To use it, you have to have Docker as well as vscode with its &quot;Remote - Containers&quot; extension (`ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers`) extension installed.Then, you just have to open this repo in vscode and run the command`Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container` from the vscode &quot;Command Palette&quot;.This will give you a full-fledged, pre-configured development environment including:- infrastructural dependencies of the service (databases, etc.)- all relevant vscode extensions pre-installed- pre-configured linting and auto-formatting- a pre-configured debugger- automatic license-header insertionMoreover, inside the devcontainer, there is following convenience command available(please type it in the integrated terminal of vscode):- `dev_install` - install the lib with all development dependencies and pre-commit hooks(please run that if you are starting the devcontainer for the first timeor if added any python dependencies to the [`./setup.cfg`](./setup.cfg))If you prefer not to use vscode, you could get a similar setup (without the editor specific features)by running the following commands:``` bash# Execute in the repo's root dir:cd ./.devcontainer# build and run the environment with docker-composedocker build -t ghga-service-commons .docker run -it ghga-service-commons /bin/bash```## LicenseThis repository is free to use and modify according to the [Apache 2.0 License](./LICENSE).</longdescription>

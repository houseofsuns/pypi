	<longdescription># Logging library for Python using Stackdriver## Reference for good logging[here](https://fangpenlin.com/posts/2012/08/26/good-logging-practice-in-python/)Check out 'Write logging records everywhere with a proper level' section ## To use logging:1. Copy logging.yaml and stackdriver.py into the project you want to use2. In order to import the logger, 'from stackdriver import stackdriver_logger' 3. In order to initialize the logger, 'mdp_logger = stackdriver_logger()'4. In order to use the logger, 'mdp_logger.info('shows up on stackdriver and console')'## Logging Levels in current configuration (set in logging.yaml) - debug: lowest level and logs of these kinds don't show up as of current configuration - info: info logs will show up on stdout and in stackdriver - warning: warn logs will show up on stdout and in stackdriver - error: error logs will show up on stdout and in stackdrtiver - critical: critical logs will show up on stdout and in stackdriver## Change log level that shows up in StackdriverIn logging.yaml, under handlers:stackdriver, change the level field to the lowest level you want to see in stackdriver.Anything that level and higher will now show up.## Change log level that shows up on consoleIn logging.yaml, under handlers:console, change the level field to the lowest level you want to see show up in console.Anything that level and higher will now show up.</longdescription>

	<longdescription># Horde Model ReferenceThis package provides some tools to help manage the models which power the [AI-Horde](https://github.com/db0/AI-Horde).## Reference info (.json files)For now, the legacy reference format will be availible as before at the [original official repo](https://github.com/Haidra-Org/AI-Horde-image-model-reference) used in the past.### stable_diffusion.jsonYou can find a schema for an individual record in the file `stable_diffusion.schema.json` in the root of this repository. Also see `stable_diffusion.example.json` for a small example containing two records will all of the fields populated.### stable_diffusion.json changesYou can see two records which include entries for every field, and the associated metadata in `stable_diffusion.example.json` at the root of this repository.Some key takeaways for the new `stable_diffusion.json`:- The following keys have been removed:  - `type`  - `download_all`  - `available`  - the sub-key `file_path` under `download`  - the entire key `files` under `config` has been removed.     - (`config` still contains a `download` key, which is a list of all files to download.)- `baseline`'s old values have been normalized. The currently valid values are as follows:  - `stable_diffusion_1`  - `stable_diffusion_2_768`  - `stable_diffusion_2_512`- An MD5 sum is no longer included. All models (of all types) will have an SHA included from now on.- `download` entries optionally contain a new key, `known_slow_download`, which indicates this download host is known to be slow at times.Moving forward, you can expect the schema to honor at least the existing values. There is a strong possibility additional fields will be added.## Python libraryThis repo is also a python library designed to help you integrate the scheme the AI-Horde project uses to manage its models into your project.### General infoYou can install this module through pip:```python -m pip install horde_model_reference```This library has a number of python classes which may assist you in working with the model reference. The following files may be of interest:- horde_model_reference\model_reference_records.py  - Contains pydantic definitions, and some meta information, for all record types.- horde_model_reference\meta_consts.py  - Contains many commonly used strings, enums, and certain useful dict lookups.- horde_model_reference\path_consts.py  - Contains certain potentially useful paths, path constructors and folder/file name information relevant to the package.Note that a number of useful imports have been made availible at the `horde_model_reference` import level.## Horde Moderators/Support Staff### ValidatingWhen making changes to stable_diffusion.json, you can now validate, format, and standardize it for consistency. You can do this by invoking the following:```validate_sd stable_diffusion.json```This will give you a success message if the file is standardized. If it is not, you can invoke the following:```validate_sd stable_diffusion.json --write validated_and_formatted.json```This will write the appropriately normalized json out to the path specified by `--write`. It will only write a file out if the input file is valid json and conforms to the established schema.</longdescription>

This will isolate the dependencies and ensure they don't conflict with other tools.```bash$ pipx install git-co-evg-base```### Debugging installation issuesA common issue that arises during installation is pipx failing to install git-co-evg-base and printing out the following error:```bash$ pipx install git-co-evg-baseFatal error from pip prevented installation. Full pip output in file:    /home/ubuntu/.local/pipx/logs/cmd_2022-03-31_13.24.42_pip_errors.logSome possibly relevant errors from pip install:    ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement git-co-evg-base (from versions: none)    ERROR: No matching distribution found for git-co-evg-baseError installing git-co-evg-base.```This error indicates that pipx could not find a version of git-co-evg-base that was built to support the version of Python installed on your machine.Make sure to check that your version of Python matches the requirements called out in the [Dependencies](#dependencies) section. Youcan check the version of Python that is on your computer by running```bash$ python --version```If you are running into the issue above but are sure that the correct version of Python is installed on your computer,you can explicitly specify a path to the correct Python version during installation.```bash$ which python3.9/usr/bin/python3.9$ pipx install git-co-evg-base --python /usr/bin/python3.9```## UsageDetailed usage documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/git-co-evg-base/tree/main/docs/usage.md).```Usage: git-co-evg-base [OPTIONS]  Find and perform git actions on a recent commit that matches the specified criteria.  When running an Evergreen patch build, it can be useful that base your changes on a commit in  which the tests in Evergreen have already been run. This way if you encounter any failures in  your patch build, you can easily compare the failure with what was seen in the base commit to  understand if your changes may have introduced the failure.  This command allows you to specify criteria to use to find a git commit to start work from.  Criteria  There are 5 criteria that can be specified:  * The percentage of tasks that have passed in each build.  * The percentage of tasks that have failed in each build.  * The percentage of tasks that have run in each build.  * Specific tasks that must have passed in each build (if they are part of that build).  * Specific tasks that must have run in each build (if they are part of that build).  If no criteria are specified, a success threshold of 0.95 will be used and the other 4 above  options will be null.  Additionally, you can specify which build variants the criteria should be checked against. By  default, all build variants will be checked.  Notes  If you have any evergreen modules with local checkouts in the location specified in your  project's evergreen.yml configuration file. They will automatically be checked out to the  revision that was run in Evergreen with the revision of the base project.  Examples  Working on a fix for a task 'replica_sets_jscore_passthrough' on the build variants '! Amazon  Linux 2 arm64 (all feature flags)' and '! Enterprise Windows (all feature flags)', to ensure the  task has been run on those build variants:      git co-evg-base --run-task replica_sets_jscore_passthrough --display-variant-name &quot;^! Amazon Linux 2 arm64 (all feature flags)$&quot; --display-variant-name &quot;^! Enterprise Windows (all feature flags)$&quot;  Starting a new change, to ensure that there are no systemic failures on the base commit:      git co-evg-base --pass-threshold 0.98Options:  --passing-task TEXT             Specify a task that needs to be passing (can be specified                                  multiple times).  --run-task TEXT                 Specify a task that needs to be run (can be specified multiple                                  times).  --run-threshold FLOAT           Specify the percentage of tasks that need to be run.  --pass-threshold FLOAT          Specify the percentage of tasks that need to be successful.  --fail-threshold FLOAT          Specify the percentage of tasks that need to be failed.  --evg-config-file PATH          File containing evergreen authentication information.

When specified, git-                                  operation is set to checkout by default.  --save-criteria TEXT            Save the specified criteria rules under the specified name for                                  future use.  --use-criteria TEXT             Use previously save criteria rules.  --list-criteria                 Display saved criteria.  --override                      Override saved conflicting save criteria rules.  --export-criteria TEXT          Specify saved criteria to export to a file.  --export-file PATH              File to write exported rules to.  --import-criteria PATH          Import previously exported criteria.  --output-format [plaintext|yaml|json]                                  Format of the command output.

Pre-commit will runconfigured checks at git commit time. To enable pre-commit on your local repository run:```bashpoetry run pre-commit install```### VersioningThis project uses [semver](https://semver.org/) for versioning.Please include a description what is added for each new version in `CHANGELOG.md`.### Code ReviewPlease open a Github Pull Request for code review.### DeploymentDeployment to pypi is automatically triggered on merges to main.## Resources* [Evergreen REST documentation](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/evergreen/wiki/REST-V2-Usage)</longdescription>

A good candidate for a &quot;timepoint&quot; model is one that is used to cover other data collection, such as an `edc_appointment.Appointment`. When the appointment status is set to something like 'complete' the timepoint status is set to ``closed`` and no further edits are allowed for data covered by that appointment.Configuring the Timepoint Model~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Select a model that represent a timepoint. The model should at least have a `datetime` field and a `status` field. For example `Appointment`:.. code-block:: python    class Appointment(TimepointModelMixin, BaseUuidModel):        appt_datetime = models.DateTimeField(            verbose_name='Appointment date and time')        appt_status = models.CharField(            verbose_name='Status',            choices=APPT_STATUS,            max_length=25,            default='NEW')The ``TimepointModelMixin`` adds fields and methods prefixed as ``timepoint_&lt;something&gt;``. There is also a signal that is loaded in the ``AppConfig.ready`` that resets the timepoint attributes should ``Appointment.appt_status`` change from ``DONE``.Only field ``timepoint_status`` is meant to be edited by the user. The other ``timepoint_&lt;something&gt;`` are managed automatically.In your projects ``apps.py`` subclass ``edc_timepoint.apps.AppConfig`` and declare ``Appointment`` as a timepoint model by creating a ``Timepoint`` instance and appending it to ``AppConfig.timepoints``:.. code-block:: python    from django.apps import AppConfig as DjangoAppConfig    from edc_timepoint.apps import AppConfig as EdcTimepointAppConfigParent    from edc_timepoint.timepoint import Timepoint    class AppConfig(DjangoAppConfig):        name = 'example'    class EdcTimepointAppConfig(EdcTimepointAppConfigParent):        timepoints = TimepointCollection(            timepoints=[Timepoint(                model='example.appointment',                datetime_field='appt_datetime',                status_field='appt_status',                closed_status='DONE')])The user updates the ``Appointment`` normally closing it when the appointment is done. Then a data manager or supervisor can close the ``Appointment`` to further edit once the data has been reviewed.To close the ``Appointment`` to further edit the code needs to call the ``timepoint_close_timepoint`` method:.. code-block:: python    appointment = Appointment.objects.create(**options)    appointment.appt_status = 'DONE'    appointment.timepoint_close_timepoint()If the ``appointment.appt_status`` is not ``DONE`` when ``timepoint_close_timepoint`` is called, a ``TimepointError`` is raised.If the appointment is successfully closed to further edit, any attempts to call ``appointment.save()`` will raise a ``TimepointError``.The ``Appointment`` may be re-opened for edit by calling method ``timepoint_open_timepoint``.Configuring others to use the Timepoint Model~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Continuing with the example above where ``Appointment`` is the timepoint model.To prevent further edits to models related to ``Appointment``, configure the model with the ``TimepointLookupModelMixin`` and the ``TimepointLookup`` class. These models will refer to the timepoint model on ``save``.For example:.. code-block:: python    class VisitTimepointLookup(TimepointLookup):        timepoint_related_model_lookup = 'appointment'    class VisitModel(TimepointLookupModelMixin, BaseUuidModel):        timepoint_lookup_cls = VisitTimepointLookup        appointment = models.ForeignKey(Appointment)        report_datetime = models.DateTimeField(            default=timezone.now)If the timepoint model's ``timepoint_status`` is ``closed``, any attempt to create or modify ``VisitModel`` will raise a ``TimepointClosed`` exception... |pypi| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/edc-timepoint.svg    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/edc-timepoint.. |actions| image:: https://github.com/clinicedc/edc-timepoint/workflows/build/badge.svg?branch=develop  :target: https://github.com/clinicedc/edc-timepoint/actions?query=workflow:build.. |codecov| image:: https://codecov.io/gh/clinicedc/edc-timepoint/branch/develop/graph/badge.svg  :target: https://codecov.io/gh/clinicedc/edc-timepoint.. |downloads| image:: https://pepy.tech/badge/edc-timepoint   :target: https://pepy.tech/project/edc-timepoint</longdescription>

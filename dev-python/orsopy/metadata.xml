This data is written following the `ORSO defined specification`_, enabling a metadata-rich and flexible file to be created. `ORSO`_ is an open organisation aimed at improving the scientific techniques of neutron and X-ray reflectometry. In the interest of transparency, all minutes from orsopy developer meetings are available in the `Documents`_ in the sidebar of this page. If you are interested in getting involved in developing orsopy, please feel free to `contribute`_ or get in touch on the `ORSO Slack`_ (where there is a channel dedicated to orsopy).Features--------* `Reading and writing of ORSO specification reduced reflectivity files`_. .. _`reduced data file format`: https://www.reflectometry.org/file_formats/.. _`ORSO defined specification`: https://www.reflectometry.org/file_format/specification.. _`ORSO`: https://www.reflectometry.org.. _`Documents`: https://orsopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/documents.html.. _`contribute`: https://orsopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html.. _`ORSO Slack`: https://join.slack.com/t/orso-co/shared_invite/zt-z7p3v89g-~JgCbzcxurQP6ufqdfTCfw.. _`Reading and writing of ORSO specification reduced reflectivity files`: https://orsopy.rtfd.io/en/latest/modules.html#fileio</longdescription>

	<longdescription># EmbedOps ToolsCLI tool for enabling easier and smoother local development for embedded systems via the command line. Promotes usage of Docker and best practices for modern embedded development.## Current FeaturesParse CI YAML files to allow for jobs to be run in the same containers and the same way locally as they do on CI.## Python Packages neededdefined in requirements.txt and setup.cfg### YAML finding and parsingFunctionality:- Show names of all jobs- Show detailed job contextLimitations:- No guarantee of YAML written by anyone other than Dojo Five employees will be able to run as expected- Can only be run from the current working directory your pipeline scripts expect to be in as there is no way to set cwd explicitly- Only works with BitBucket and GitLab YAML files, and GitHub Actions with only one workflow file- Will not use, search for, nor help set environment variables defined outside of YAML- no way to mark that a job shouldn't be run locally or hide non-runnable jobs- Will show &quot;hidden&quot; GitLab jobs and allow them to be run- Does not handle `extends:` keyword in GitLab CI/CD- Only handles multi-line script with a **complete command** in each line.  - This is applied to both `|` (literal) and `&gt;` (folded) YAML multiline block scalar indicator  - For example, it doesn't work if the `if-else` statement is called in multiple lines. \    Working example:    ```bash    script: |      FILE=.clang-format      if [ -f &quot;$FILE&quot; ]; then echo &quot;$FILE exists. Use repository $FILE.&quot;; else echo &quot;$FILE does not exist. Use container $FILE.&quot;; cp /tools/.clang-format .clang-format; fi    ```    Failing example:    ```bash    script: |      FILE=.clang-format      if [ -f &quot;$FILE&quot; ]; then          echo &quot;$FILE exists. Use repository $FILE.&quot;      else          echo &quot;$FILE does not exist. Use container $FILE.&quot;          cp /tools/.clang-format .clang-format      fi    ```- GitHub  Auto-detection of the GitHub CI configuration file works only if there is one file in the .github/workflows directory. When there are more than one files in that directory, use the --filename flag to specify a GitHub CI configuration.  Syntax:  ```bash  embedops-cli jobs --filename &lt;PATH_TO_CI_CONFIG_FILE&gt; run &lt;JOB_NAME&gt;  ```Not Implemented:- Info to pull from YAML:  - after/before scripts?- `include:`, `extends:` on GitLab, `uses:` on GitHub, `pipe:` on BitBucket not supported### Docker container launching / checking /runningFunctionality:- use parsed YAML information- map cwd to Docker container and launch (sets mounted directory as container's cwd)- Run script in docker container found above- Output any artifacts in the mounted directory- Login to the EmbedOps registry for paying clientsLimitations:- Assume all jobs have an explicit image tag or a default image tag in yaml- Assume all jobs have a script (not handling entrypoints)- Must be launched from the top level working directory of the project (where YAML is stored)- doesn't clean up after itself - all artifacts are left behind, not just desired ones.- no way to specify clean and build vs rebuild unless explicitly defined in YAML- Env variables used but not defined in YAML must be set by user in .env file manually, no error checking- look for .wslconfig on Windows and suggest edits or add if not found- Attempt to start docker if it's not running?- Execution of the docker image is not identical to CI pipeline execution leading to potential suttle differences in output behavior- The CLI does not:  - utilize a bootstrap image so startup behavior compared to the CI pipeline is slightly different  - Pass script commands to the docker image via STDIN, instead a single command is executed in full with a single `docker run`. This leads to some differences in how STDIN/STDOUT behave compared to the pipeline. A TTY is not created, an interactive session is not created (ie no `-it` passed to `docker run`), and the docker session acts as if being run in a pipe.Not Implemented:- Run before or after script- run entire pipeline or workflow at once- shell and any other non-Docker based runners are not supported on any system at this time## EndpointsFunctionality:- Log in to EmbedOps via CLI- Auth0 connection from embedops.io to registryNot Implemented:- Jobs run from CLI do not talk to API## InstallationFuntionality:- Available on embedops.com in PyPi package registryLimitations:- Little to no documentationNot Implemented:- New version check and message## LicenseCopyright 2023 Dojo Five, LLC</longdescription>

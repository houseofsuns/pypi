	<longdescription>netconf-console2================A console application for interacting with NETCONF servers built on topof `ncclient &lt;http://https://pypi.org/project/ncclient/&gt;`__.*Note:* this is a continuation (or a rename) of the project``netconf-console``; the old name was clashing with another product.  Use``netconf-console2`` instead of ``netconf-console``.Requirements and installation-----------------------------This application runs both in Python 2 and Python 3 environments. Theonly package required for running this application is ``ncclient``; ifthis is installed, all other necessary packages are installed asdependencies. This means that if you can (successfully) run somethinglike ``pip install ncclient`` on the target platform, all requirementsshould be met.If you cannot, there still is a chance you can run it if the target platformsupports at least packages ``six`` and ``lxml``, which are commonly present;and if it contains ``paramiko`` or at least ``cryptography``, you will be ableto use SSH (without them you can only use plain and nonstandard TCPtransport). The missing piece, ``ncclient``, can be `cloned&lt;https://github.com/ncclient/ncclient&gt;`__ and compiled to a &quot;Python Wheel&quot; -you can do this on any computer and copy the resulting ``.whl`` file to thetarget platform, it should work there. Pretty much the same holds for``paramiko``. You may also want to create a wheel for the application itself byrunning ``python setup.py bdist_wheel``.Installing and running the application~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~If you can and want to install the application and all necessarylibraries, just run ``python setup.py install``. Otherwise prepare allnecessary .whl files and the script ``netconf-console2`` to the targetplatform. If they are in the same directory, nothing else is needed,otherwise you may need to add the wheel files to ``PYTHONPATH`` beforerunning the script.Once installed or copied, you can just run the script with appropriateoptions - see below.Command-line mode-----------------The application can be run in two different modes: command-line mode andinteractive (console) mode. The command-line mode allows you to requestseveral RPC operations in one shell command. The command line wouldcontain the operation command options (``--get``, ``--lock``, etc.) inthe desired order, all common options (such as ``--host``, ``--port``etc.) as well as command options (``--db``, ``--style``); the commandoptions are all used for the commands that accept them, so for exampleno two commands can address different datastores.An example of such command line:::    # netconf-console2 --host=example.com --db candidate --lock --edit-config=fragment1.xml \    --rpc=commit-confirmed.xml --unlock --sleep 5 --rpc=confirm.xmlInteractive mode----------------The interactive mode is started by ``--interactive`` (or ``-i``). Duringan interactive session the user issues commands, one per line, withrequired arguments or options. The options are isolated now, so it ispossible to have two commands in one session accessing differentdatastores. The interactive console provides limited support fortab-completion of commands, options, and their arguments.The previous example can look like this:::    # netconf-console2 --host=example.com -i    netconf&gt; lock    netconf&gt; edit-config fragment1.xml --db candidate    netconf&gt; rpc commit-confirmed.xml    netconf&gt; unlock    netconf&gt; get-config    netconf&gt; rpc confirm.xml    netconf&gt;Note: some commands (``rpc``, ``edit-config`` and others) may acceptdata from standard input in the command-line mode; this does not work inthe interactive mode.Some capabilities of the interactive mode can be used in command-linemode too using ``--expr`` pseudo-command: the argument is a command(including options) as if it was added in the interactive mode, such as::    # netconf-console2 --expr 'get-config --db candidate' 'get-config'Commands--------A command may accept an argument and a number of options. Incommand-line mode, all option values are shared (see above); conversely,in interactive mode the option needs to be provided for every commandwhere its desired value differs from the default. If a command does notaccept given option, it is a syntax error to provide it in interactivemode (in command-line mode such situations are ignored).``hello``    Send just the initial ``hello`` message and display the reply. Does    not accept any arguments or options.``get``    Send ``get`` RPC. Accepts options ``outputStyle``, ``with-defaults``,    ``xpath``. As an alternative to ``xpath``, ``get`` accepts path as an    argument.``get-config``    Send ``get-config`` RPC. Accepts the same set of options as ``get``    plus ``db``.``set``    Send ``edit-config`` with single leaf assignment.  Requires the assignment    in the form ``&lt;path&gt;=&lt;value&gt;`` as an argument, accepts ``db``, ``test``,    and ``operation``.  The path may contain (or actually needs to contain, in    case it descends into a list instance) simple predicates in the form    ``node[key1=value1][key2=value2]...``.``delete``    Sends ``edit-config`` with a single node to be deleted.  The node is    determined by the path provided as an argument, see ``set`` for the path    format.  Accepts ``db``, ``test``, and ``del-operation`` options.``create``    Sends ``edit-config`` with a single node to be created.  The node is    determined by the path provided as an argument, see ``set`` for the path    format.``kill-session``    Send ``kill-session`` RPC. Requires session identifier as an    argument, accepts no options.``discard-changes``    Send ``discard-changes`` RPC. Accepts no arguments or options.``lock``    Send ``lock`` RPC towards the datastore indicated by ``db`` option.``unlock``    Send ``unlock`` RPC, counterpart of ``lock``.``commit``    Send ``commit`` request. Accepts optional ``confirmed`` as an    argument and option ``timeout``.``validate``    Send ``validate`` RPC. Accepts one argument, which can be either the    literal ``candidate`` (to validate the contents of the candidate    datastore) or a filename pointing to a file with full configuration    to be validated; defaults to ``-``, standard input.``copy-running-to-startup``    Send ``copy-config`` RPC with ``running`` datastore as the source    and ``startup`` datastore as target. Accepts no arguments or    options.``copy-config``    Send ``copy-config`` RPC. Accepts a filename for the source    configuration as a argument (defaults to ``-``), and the ``db``    option for the target datastore.``edit-config``    Send ``edit-config`` RPC. Accepts the same set of arguments and    options as ``copy-config``.``get-schema``    Send ``get-schema`` RPC. Requires schema identifier as an argument.``create-subscription``    Send ``create-subscription`` RPC. Requires notification stream    identifier as an argument. The notifications received from the    server are displayed on standard output while the session is active    - i.e. makes sense either in an interactive mode or in command-line    mode with the command ``sleep``.``rpc``    If none of the commands above is sufficient, a custom RPC can be    send using this command. Accepts a filename (or ``-`` as default) as    an argument; the file contents is sent to the server enveloped in    the ``rpc`` element.``sleep``    Do nothing, just sleep for given number of seconds provided as an    argument.As a backward-compatibility option, it is possible to provide a filename (or``-`` for standard input) containing all messages that are supposed to be sentto the server, separated by the NETCONF transport v1.0 message separator.  Thisoption cannot be used with any other command.  Note that RPC message-id is notpreserved.Options-------There are two sets of options: global options and command options.Global options affect overall behavior of the tool and can be providedin the shell command line (i.e. not to individual commands in theinteractive mode). Command options affect individual commands and ininteractive mode they need to be provided per command.Global options~~~~~~~~~~~~~~``help``    Display a usage message and exit.``host``    Hostname or IP address of the NETCONF server.``port``    Port number of the NETCONF server.``user``    Username for the authentication on the server (defaults to    ``admin``).``password``    Password for the authentication on the server (defaults to    ``admin``). If the option is provided without a value, the password    is read from the terminal.``privKeyFile``    File containing the user's private key.``raw``    Print all received replies in the original form. The option accepts    one argument, name of file where the text should be stored; defaults    to standard output.``tcp``    Use plain TCP for the communication with the server (without this    option SSH is used).``dry``    Do not actually send any RPCs, just display them to standard output.Local options~~~~~~~~~~~~~As written above, local (or command) options are meaningful only forcertain command.``outputStyle``    Affects the format of the displayed RPC reply. By default, the reply    is pretty-printed, but otherwise kept as is. The option accepts    ``plain`` (do no pretty-printing) and ``noaaa`` (remove the ``aaa``    subtree from the reply from ``get`` or ``get-config`` requests).``db``    Target datastore for some of the RPC operations. Defaults to    ``running``.``timeout``    Timeout in seconds for confirmed commit.``with-defaults``    Set default values handling. Accepted values are ``explicit``,    ``trim``, ``report-all``, ``report-all-tagged``.``xpath``    Set the XPath filter for get or subscribe requests.``ns``    Set a namespace prefix list; useful in case ``xpath`` option uses    namespace prefixes.``test``    Test-option value. Accepted values are ``test-only``,    ``test-then-set`` and ``set``.``operation``    Value of the attribute ``nc:operation``.  Useful with the ``set``    operation, can be ``merge`` (the default), ``replace``, ``create``.``del-operation``    Value of the attribute ``nc:operation`` when used with the ``delete``    operation, can be ``remove`` (the default) or ``delete``.</longdescription>

In the main metric, only informative nucleotides (A, T, G, C) are considered identical to each other. The tool also provides some further metrics (e.g. regarding ambiguous 'N's) and splits the input FASTA into _valid_ and _failed_ FASTA files for further processing.#### Installation:To install president with conda, run the commands below:```conda create -y -n president -c bioconda -c conda-forge presidentconda activate president```Note that `pblat` is a dependency and only runs on Linux. Alternatively, president can be installed with pip in an environment where pblat is in the PATH:[comment]: # (on pip it is pypresident because there is another package called president)[comment]: # (if changed to president the wrong package will be installed)```pip install pypresident```Another possibility is to use a docker image with all dependencies installed:```docker pull rkibioinf/president:latest```#### Usage:The pairwise alignment can be run with the following console call:```president --query query.fasta --reference reference.fasta -x identity_threshold -n n_threshold -t threads -p /path/to/output/ -f prefix```To run an example, download a [query](https://gitlab.com/RKIBioinformaticsPipelines/president/-/raw/master/examples/NC_045512.2.20mis.fasta) FASTA anda [reference](https://gitlab.com/RKIBioinformaticsPipelines/president/-/raw/master/examples/NC_045512.2.fasta) FASTA from GitLab.Run the alignment with the following command and identity of ACGT bases of 90% and maximal 5% Ns in the query. Note that multiple fasta sequences are allowed to be present in the query but **not** in the reference FASTA.```president -q NC_045512.2.20mis.fasta -r NC_045512.2.fasta -x 0.9 -n 0.05 -t 4 -p output/ -f test_```#### Output:The script provides:* a tab-separated file with the below listed columns* a FASTA file with _valid_ sequences* a FASTA file with _invalid_ sequencesThe separation between the _valid_ and _invalid_ bin is mainly based on the defined identity/n thresholds (`-x`, default: 0.9; `-n`, default: 0.05) and further sanity checks (non-IUPAC characters).Note that for multiple query inputs the valid and invalid sequence headers are NOT associate with their filename. This meta information must be retrieved from the report.An example from the call described above can be found [online](https://gitlab.com/RKIBioinformaticsPipelines/president/-/raw/master/examples/report.csv).**Attention**: If your query sequence includes gap symbols (`-` or `.`; for example from a previous alignment step), `president` will **remove** them from the output sequence! Rational: Gap symbols should be not part of a consensus sequence (for which the tool was developed) and will therefore be removed. **Until version 0.6.7 gap symbols were replaced with `N`!**The transposed version of the output is shown below.| variable                                          | value                                                                                           ||:--------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|| query_name                                        | NC_045512.2 Severe acute [...]                                                                  || reference_name                                    | NC_045512.2 Severe acute [...]                                                                  || file_in_query                                    | NC_045512.2.20mis.fasta                                                                         || file_in_ref                                       | NC_045512.2.fasta                                                                               || ACGT Nucleotide identity                          | 0.9987                                                                                          || ACGT Nucleotide identity (ignoring Ns)            | 0.9994                                                                                          || ACGT Nucleotide identity (ignoring non-ACGTNs)    | 0.9994                                                                                          || qc_all_valid                                      | True                                                                                            || qc_is_empty_query                                 | False                                                                                           || qc_post_align_pass_threshold                      | True                                                                                            || qc_post_aligned                                   | True                                                                                            || qc_post_aligned_all_valid                         | True                                                                                            || qc_valid_length                                   | True                                                                                            || qc_valid_nucleotides                              | True                                                                                            || qc_valid_pass_nthreshold                          | True                                                                                            || acgt_bases                                        | 29883                                                                                           || iupac_bases                                       | 20                                                                                              || non_iupac_bases                                   | 0                                                                                               || N_bases                                           | 20                                                                                              || length_query                                      | 29903                                                                                           || length_reference                                  | 29903                                                                                           || LongestNGap                                       | 20                                                                                              || Matches                                           | 29864                                                                                           || Mismatches                                        | 19                                                                                              || query_description                                 |                                                                                                 || query_index                                       | 0                                                                                               || Date                                              | 2021-01-20                                                                                      |##### Definitions:1) query_name -

	<longdescription># Conf FuA configuration package that allows you to configure your Python scripts, through a combination of JSON configuration files and command line options, with a minimum of code.## InstallInstall the package:```pip install conffu```Note: on Linux, you may need to install `libffi-dev` and re-install Python if installation causes a 'No module named `_ctypes` error'. This is not specific to `conffu`, but any package requiring `_ctypes` in one of its dependencies.If you want to be able to read/write XML configurations as well, there is a dependency on `lxml`, install using:```pip install conffu[xml]```## ExampleWith the package installed, try running this script:```from conffu import Configcfg = Config({    '_globals': {        'temp': 'C:/Temp'    },    'temp_file': '{temp}/text.txt',    'number': 3})print(f'The number is {cfg.number}')cfg.save('example_config.json')```After running that, this also works:```from conffu import Configcfg = Config.from_file('example_config.json')print(f'The number is {cfg.number}')```Make a change and save this script as `example.py`:```from conffu import Configcfg = Config.from_file('example_config.json').update_from_arguments()print(f'The number is {cfg.number}')```Then try running it like this:```python example.py -number 7``` There's many more options, check the documentation for more examples.### CaveatNote that `Config` allows you to do this:```pythonfrom conffu import Configcfg = Config()cfg['test'] = 1print(cfg.test)  # prints 1cfg.test = 2print(cfg.test)  # prints 2```That is, you're allowed to access configuration keys as if they were attributes on the configuration. However, if you try to access a key that happens to also be an attribute on the object, you get the attribute. This has the advantage that the feature doesn't break how objects work in Python, but the disadvantage that you'll need to access keys that have the same name as object attributes using the dictionary syntax. For example:```pythonfrom conffu import Configcfg = Config()# create a new config value acfg['a'] = 1# change the value of a, accessing it as you would a property / attributecfg.a = 2# create a new object attribute bcfg.b = 3# this does not change the attribute b, because you're directly accessing a new config value bcfg.['b'] = 4print(cfg.a, cfg.b)  # prints 2 3print(cfg['a'], cfg['b'])  # prints 2 4```If you don't like this behaviour, consider using the `DictConfig` class instead of `Config` - they are identical, except that the `DictConfig` does not have this behaviour and you must always access keys like `cfg['test']`, or `cfg['key.subkey']`.If you do like the ability to access configuration values like attributes, you should take care that your code only assigns to existing values (initialise them as 'null' when creating the config from json for example), or that you use the dictionary syntax when assigning values and you only use the attribute syntax for reading values.## LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT license.

	<longdescription>A library for event sourcing in Python.*&quot;totally amazing and a pleasure to use&quot;**&quot;very clean and intuitive&quot;**&quot;a huge help and time saver&quot;*Please [read the docs](https://eventsourcing.readthedocs.io/). See also [extension projects](https://github.com/pyeventsourcing).## InstallationUse pip to install the [stable distribution](https://pypi.org/project/eventsourcing/)from the Python Package Index.    $ pip install eventsourcingPlease note, it is recommended to install Pythonpackages into a Python virtual environment.## SynopsisDefine aggregates with the `Aggregate` class and the `@event` decorator.```pythonfrom eventsourcing.domain import Aggregate, eventclass Dog(Aggregate):    @event('Registered')    def __init__(self, name):        self.name = name        self.tricks = []    @event('TrickAdded')    def add_trick(self, trick):        self.tricks.append(trick)```Define application objects with the `Application` class.```pythonfrom eventsourcing.application import Applicationclass DogSchool(Application):    def register_dog(self, name):        dog = Dog(name)        self.save(dog)        return dog.id    def add_trick(self, dog_id, trick):        dog = self.repository.get(dog_id)        dog.add_trick(trick)        self.save(dog)    def get_dog(self, dog_id):        dog = self.repository.get(dog_id)        return {'name': dog.name, 'tricks': tuple(dog.tricks)}```Write a test.```pythondef test_dog_school():    # Construct application object.    school = DogSchool()    # Evolve application state.    dog_id = school.register_dog('Fido')    school.add_trick(dog_id, 'roll over')    school.add_trick(dog_id, 'play dead')    # Query application state.    dog = school.get_dog(dog_id)    assert dog['name'] == 'Fido'    assert dog['tricks'] == ('roll over', 'play dead')    # Select notifications.    notifications = school.notification_log.select(start=1, limit=10)    assert len(notifications) == 3```Run the test with the default persistence module. Events are storedin memory using Python objects.```pythontest_dog_school()```Configure the application to run with an SQLite database. Other persistence modules are available.```pythonimport osos.environ[&quot;PERSISTENCE_MODULE&quot;] = 'eventsourcing.sqlite'os.environ[&quot;SQLITE_DBNAME&quot;] = 'dog-school.db'```Run the test with SQLite.```pythontest_dog_school()```See the [documentation](https://eventsourcing.readthedocs.io/) for more information.## Features**Aggregates and applications** — base classes for event-sourced aggregatesand applications. Suggests how to structure an event-sourced application. Allclasses are fully type-hinted to guide developers in using the library.**Flexible event store** — flexible persistence of aggregate events. Combinesan event mapper and an event recorder in ways that can be easily extended.Mapper uses a transcoder that can be easily extended to support custommodel object types. Recorders supporting different databases can be easilysubstituted and configured with environment variables.**Application-level encryption and compression** — encrypts and decrypts events inside theapplication. This means data will be encrypted in transit across a network (&quot;on the wire&quot;)and at disk level including backups (&quot;at rest&quot;), which is a legal requirement in somejurisdictions when dealing with personally identifiable information (PII) for examplethe EU's GDPR. Compression reduces the size of stored aggregate events and snapshots, usuallyby around 25% to 50% of the original size. Compression reduces the size of datain the database and decreases transit time across a network.**Snapshotting** — reduces access-time for aggregates that have many events.**Versioning** - allows changes to be introduced after an applicationhas been deployed. Both aggregate events and aggregate snapshots can be versioned.**Optimistic concurrency control** — ensures a distributed or horizontally scaledapplication doesn't become inconsistent due to concurrent method execution. Leveragesoptimistic concurrency controls in adapted database management systems.**Notifications and projections** — reliable propagation of applicationevents with pull-based notifications allows the application state to beprojected accurately into replicas, indexes, view models, and other applications.Supports materialized views and CQRS.**Event-driven systems** — reliable event processing. Event-driven systemscan be defined independently of particular persistence infrastructure and mode ofrunning.**Detailed documentation** — documentation provides general overview, introductionof concepts, explanation of usage, and detailed descriptions of library classes.All code is annotated with type hints.**Worked examples** — includes examples showing how to develop aggregates, applicationsand systems.## ExtensionsThe GitHub organisation[Event Sourcing in Python](https://github.com/pyeventsourcing)hosts extension projects for the Python eventsourcing library.There are projects that adapt popular ORMs such as[Django](https://github.com/pyeventsourcing/eventsourcing-django#readme)and [SQLAlchemy](https://github.com/pyeventsourcing/eventsourcing-sqlalchemy#readme).There are projects that adapt specialist event stores such as[Axon Server](https://github.com/pyeventsourcing/eventsourcing-axonserver#readme) and[EventStoreDB](https://github.com/pyeventsourcing/eventsourcing-eventstoredb#readme).There are projects that support popular NoSQL databases such as[DynamoDB](https://github.com/pyeventsourcing/eventsourcing-dynamodb#readme).There are also projects that provide examples of using thelibrary with web frameworks such as[FastAPI](https://github.com/pyeventsourcing/example-fastapi#readme)and [Flask](https://github.com/pyeventsourcing/example-flask#readme),and for serving applications and running systems with efficientinter-process communication technologies like [gRPC](https://github.com/pyeventsourcing/eventsourcing-grpc#readme).And there are examples of event-sourced applications and systemsof event-sourced applications, such as the[Paxos system](https://github.com/pyeventsourcing/example-paxos#readme),which is used as the basis for a[replicated state machine](https://github.com/pyeventsourcing/example-paxos/tree/master/replicatedstatemachine),which is used as the basis for a[distributed key-value store](https://github.com/pyeventsourcing/example-paxos/tree/master/keyvaluestore).## ProjectThis project is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/pyeventsourcing/eventsourcing).Please register questions, requests and[issues on GitHub](https://github.com/pyeventsourcing/eventsourcing/issues),or post in the project's Slack channel.There is a [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/eventsourcinginpython/shared_invite/enQtMjczNTc2MzcxNDI0LTJjMmJjYTc3ODQ3M2YwOTMwMDJlODJkMjk3ZmE1MGYyZDM4MjIxODZmYmVkZmJkODRhZDg5N2MwZjk1YzU3NmY)for this project, which you are [welcome to join](https://join.slack.com/t/eventsourcinginpython/shared_invite/enQtMjczNTc2MzcxNDI0LTJjMmJjYTc3ODQ3M2YwOTMwMDJlODJkMjk3ZmE1MGYyZDM4MjIxODZmYmVkZmJkODRhZDg5N2MwZjk1YzU3NmY).Please refer to the [documentation](https://eventsourcing.readthedocs.io/) for installation and usage guides.</longdescription>

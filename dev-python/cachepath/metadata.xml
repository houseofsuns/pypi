	<longdescription>Welcome to cachepath's documentation!======================================.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/cachepath.svg        :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cachepath.. image:: https://img.shields.io/travis/haydenflinner/cachepath.svg        :target: https://travis-ci.org/haydenflinner/cachepath.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/cachepath/badge/?version=latest        :target: https://cachepath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest        :alt: Documentation StatusA small package for pythonic parameterized cache paths.Getting Started----------------**Install:** ``pip install cachepath``**Import:** ``from cachepath import CachePath, TempPath, Path``**Docs:** `ReadTheDocs`_ | `API doc is here`_**Why?**    1. Integrates ``pathlib`` with ``tempfile.gettempdir`` and ``shutil.rmtree`` by providing ``TempPath`` and ``Path.rm()``::          path = TempPath()          path.rm()          # or would you rather..          path = None          with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False) as f:              path = Path(f.name)          # Only now can we use Path. If we tried using it within the With          # (for example for path.read_text()), we'd break on Windows          path.unlink()  # only if file, doesn't work on folders    2. Wraps ``pathlib`` import for Py2/3 compat. (not in ``six``!)::          from cachepath import Path          # or          try: from pathlib import Path; except ImportError: from pathlib2 import Path    3. Provides `CachePath`_, which lets you quickly get a parameterized temp filename, with all folders automatically created::          r = CachePath(date, userid, 'expensive_results.txt')          assert (r == Path('/tmp/', date, userid, 'expensive_results.txt')                  and r.parent.exists())          r.rm()  # File remove          r.parent.rm()  # Symmetric with folder remove!          # Without cachepath          p = Path(tempfile.gettempdir(), date, userid, 'expensive_results.txt').          # Don't update timestamp if it already exists so that we don't cause          # Make-like tools to always think something's changed          if not p.parent.exists():              p.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)          p.unlink()  # Why is it .unlink() instead of .remove()?          # Why .remove and .unlink, but mkdir instead of createdir?          p.parent.remove()          # .remove() might throw because there was another file in the folder,          # but we didn't care, they're tempfiles!          import shutil          shutil.rmtree(p.parent)**Why, but longer:**Do you need a temp path to pass to some random tool for its logfile?Behold, a gaping hole in ``pathlib``::    import tempfile    import os    try: from pathlib import Path; except ImportError: from pathlib2 import Path    def get_tempfile():        fd, loc = tempfile.mkstemp()        os.close(fd)  # If we forgot do this, it would stay open until process exit        return Path(loc)    # Easier way    from cachepath import TempPath    def get_tempfile():        return TempPath()  # Path('/tmp/213kjdsrandom')But this module is called cachepath, not temppath, what gives?Suppose I'm running that same imaginary tool pretty often, but I'd like to skip runningit if I already have results for a certain day. Just sticking some identifying info into a filenameshould be good enough.Something like ``Path('/tmp/20181204_toolresults.txt')`` ::    # try: from pathlib import Path; except ImportError: from pathlib2 import Path    # We'll cheat a little to get py2/3 compat without so much ugliness    from cachepath import Path    import tempfile    def get_tempfile(date):        filename = '{}_toolresults.txt'.format(date)        return Path(tempfile.gettempdir(), filename)    # Easier to do this...    from cachepath import CachePath    def get_tempfile(date):        return CachePath(date, suffix='.txt')Not bad, but not great. But our requirements changed, let's go a step further.Now I'm running this tool *a lot*, over a tree of data that lookslike this::    2018-12-23        person1        person2    2018-12-24        person1    2018-12-25        person1I want my logs to be structured the same way.  How hard can it be? ::    2018-12-23/        person1_output.txt        person2_output.txt    2018-12-24/        person1_output.txt    2018-12-25/        person1_output.txtLet's find out::    # Let's get the easy way out of the way first :)    def get_path(date, person):        return CachePath(date, person, suffix='_output.txt')        # Automatically ensures /tmp/date/ exists when we create the CachePath!    # Now the hard way    def get_path(date, person):        personfilename = '{p}_output.txt'.format(p=person)        returning = Path(tempfile.gettempdir())/date/personfilename        # Does this mkdir update the modified timestamp of the folders we're in?        # Might matter if we're part of a larger toolset...        returning.parent.mkdir(exist_ok=True, parents=True)        return returningSuppose we hadn't remembered to make the ``$date/`` folders. When we passed thePath out to another tool, or tried to .open it,we may have gotten a Permission Deniederror on Unix systems rather than the &quot;File/Folder not found&quot; you might expect.With CachePath, this can't happen. Creating a CachePath implicitly creates allof the preceding directories necessary for your file to exist.Now, suppose we found a bug in this external tool we were using and we're goingto re-run it for a day.How do we clear out that day's results so that we can be sure we're lookingat fresh output from the tool? Well, with CachePath, it's just::  def easy_clear_date(date):      CachePath(date).clear()  # rm -r /tmp/date/*But if you don't have cachepath, you'll find that most Python libs play itpretty safe when it comes to files. Path.remove() requires the folder to be empty,and doesn't provide a way to empty the folder. Not to mention, what if our resultsfolders had special permissions, or was actually a symlink, and we had write accessbut not delete? Oh well,let's see what we can do::  def hard_clear_date(date):      # We happen to know that date is a folder and not a file (at least in our      # current design), so we know we need some form of .remove() rather than      # .unlink(). Unfortunately, pathlib doesn't offer one for folders with      # files still in them. If you google how to do it, you will find plenty of      # answers, one of which is a pure pathlib recursive solution! But we're lazy,      # so lets bring in yet another module:      p = Path(tempfile.gettempdir(), date)      import shutil      if p.exists():          shutil.rmtree(p)      p.mkdir(exist_ok=True, parents=True)      # This still isn't exactly equivalent to CachePath.clear(), because we've      # lost whatever permissions were set on the date folder, and if it were      # actually a symlink to somewhere else, that's gone now.Convinced yet? ``pip install cachepath`` or copy `the source`_ into your local``utils.py`` (you know you have one.)`API doc is here`_.By the way, as a side effect of importing ``cachepath``, all Paths get the abilityto do ``rm()`` and ``clear()``.Shameless Promo----------------Find yourself working with paths a lot in cmd-line tools?

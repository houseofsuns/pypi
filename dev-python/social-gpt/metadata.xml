	<longdescription># Social GPTThis package helps you to build embeddings based on someone social profile. It will scrape the data from the social media and build the embeddings based on the data. The embeddings can be used for further analysis.Once scraped, you can query it with the use of openai.## InstallationInstall using following command:`pip install social-gpt`## SetupUpdate the `example.env` and change it's name to `.env`. Add relevant information in the `.env` file.## Creating embeddingsAs of now, only youtube is supported. Also, as of now, we will scrape 50 videos, which we will extend to all of the videos shortly. We will be bringing more social media platforms soon. To create embeddings, run the following command:To get the channel id, go to this [website](https://commentpicker.com/youtube-channel-id.php) and enter the channel url. It will give you the channel id. ``` pythonfrom social_gpt.ingestion.ingestion import SocialIngestioningestion = SocialIngestion(channel_id, 'youtube')index_id = ingestion.create_embeddings()```Store this `index_id` for querying the embeddings.## Querying embeddings``` pythonfrom social_gpt.query.query_helper import QueryHelperq = QueryHelper(index_id)response = q.query('What is the best way to learn python?')print(response)```That's it!</longdescription>

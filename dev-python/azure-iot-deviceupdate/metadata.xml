	<longdescription># Azure Device Update for IoT Hub client library for PythonThe library provides access to the Device Update for IoT Hub service that enables customers to publish updates for their IoT devices to the cloud, and then deploy these updates to their devices (approve updates to groups of devices managed and provisioned in IoT Hub).[Source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/deviceupdate/azure-iot-deviceupdate) | [Package (PyPI)](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/deviceupdate-pypi) | [Product documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub-device-update/understand-device-update)## _Disclaimer__Azure SDK Python packages support for Python 2.7 has ended 01 January 2022. For more information and questions, please refer to https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/20691_## Getting started### Prerequisites- Microsoft Azure Subscription: To call Microsoft Azure services, you need to create an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)- Device Update for IoT Hub instance- Azure IoT Hub instance- Python 3.6 or later is required to use this package.### Install the packageInstall the Device Update for IoT Hub client library for Python with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):```bashpip install azure-iot-deviceupdate```## Key conceptsDevice Update for IoT Hub is a managed service that enables you to deploy over-the-air updates for your IoT devices. The client library has one main component named **DeviceUpdateClient**. The component allows you to access all three main client services:- **UpdatesOperations**: update management (import, enumerate, delete, etc.)- **ManagementOperations**: deployment management (manage devices and deployments)You can learn more about Device Update for IoT Hub by visiting [Device Update for IoT Hub](https://github.com/azure/iot-hub-device-update).## ExamplesYou can familiarize yourself with different APIs using [Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/deviceupdate/azure-iot-deviceupdate/samples).## TroubleshootingThe Device Update for IoT Hub client will raise exceptions defined in [Azure Core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/README.md).## Next stepsGet started with our [Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/deviceupdate/azure-iot-deviceupdate/samples).## ContributingIf you encounter any bugs or have suggestions, please file an issue in the [Issues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues) section of the project.&lt;!-- LINKS --&gt;[azure_core]: https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/README.md# Release History## 1.0.0 (2022-09-09)### Features Added- Added filter to DeviceManagementOperations.list_device_classes method- Updated description for some methods to be more descriptive and less ambiguous### Breaking Changes- Removed filter from DeviceManagementOperations.list_best_updates_for_group method## 1.0.0b3 (2022-07-07)### Features Added- Added `relatedFiles` and `downloadHandler` to `Update`- Updated various model that reference update to include not only `updateId` but also update `description` and `friendlyName`- Removed device tag concept- Allow to filter by deployment status in the `list_devices` method- Added ability to update device class friendly name- Added ability to delete device class- Added device class subgroups to groups- Added new method to retrieve devices health information## 1.0.0b2 (2022-01-25)### Features Added      -

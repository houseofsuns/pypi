	<longdescription>daggen======A Python port of the `daggen &lt;https://github.com/frs69wq/daggen&gt;`_ tool proposed by Suter &amp; Hunold.This library generates random, synthetic task graphs for simulation. You can easily convert thegenerated task graphs into directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) in tools such as `NetworkX &lt;https://networkx.org&gt;`_ or`igraph &lt;https://python.igraph.org&gt;`_, or export them to files. The library helps evaluate schedulingalgorithms using various application configurations.Here is an example of how to generate a DAG of 15 tasks, accepting the default parameters,and import it into igraph:.. code-block:: python   import daggen as dg   import igraph as ig   dag = dg.DAG(seed=42, num_tasks=15)   tasks, edges = dag.task_n_edge_dicts()   igraph_dag = ig.Graph.DictList(vertices=tasks, edges=edges, directed=True)You can alternatively convert the task graph into a NetworkX' DiGraph:.. code-block:: python   import daggen as dg   import networkx as nx   dag = dag.DAG(seed=46, num_tasks=15)   tasks, edges = dag.task_n_edge_tuples()   net_dag = nx.DiGraph()   net_dag.add_nodes_from(tasks)   net_dag.add_edges_from(edges)Task and edge attributes------------------------Each generated task has two attributes:- **computation:** a sequential cost (in Flops).- **alpha:** the alpha parameter of Amdahl's Law, used to encode the overhead of parallelizing tasks in parallel task graphs.Each edge represents a communication from a parent task to a child task and has a **data** attributerepresenting the amount of data transferred from parent to child.DAG parameters--------------You can configure the characteristics of the generated DAGs by parametrizing the `DAG()`.Following the C implementation, one can set the following parameters:- `seed`: used to seed the random number generator and ensure reproducibility.- `n_tasks`: Number of computation nodes (application tasks) in the DAG.- `min_data`: Minimum amount of data in bytes a task processes- `max_data`: Maximum amount of data in bytes a task processes- `min_alpha`: Minimum value for the extra parameter (e.g., Amdahl's law parameter)- `max_alpha`:  Minimum value for the extra parameter.- `fat`: Width of the DAG, the maximum number of tasks executed concurrently. A small value results in a thin DAG  (e.g., chain) with low task parallelism, while a large value creates a fat DAG (e.g., fork-join)  with a high degree of parallelism.- `density`: Determines the dependencies between tasks of two consecutive DAG levels.- `regular`: Regularity of the task distribution between the different levels of the DAG.- `ccr`:  Communication to computation ratio. It encodes the complexity of the computation of a task  depending on the size `n` of the dataset it processes. The encoding is as follows:  * 1 : `a * n` (`a` is a constant picked randomly between 26 and 29).  * 2 : `a * n log n`  * 3 : `n3/2`  * 0 : Random choice among the three complexities.- `jump_size`:   Maximum number of levels spanned by inter-task communications, which enables DAGs  with execution paths of multiple lengths.</longdescription>

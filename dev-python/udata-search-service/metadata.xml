	<longdescription># udata-search-serviceA search service for udata.The idea is to have search service separated from the udata MongoDB.The indexation update is made using real-time HTTP messages.See the following architecture schema:![Udata Search Service architecture schema](docs/udata-search-service-schema.png &quot;Udata Search Service architecture schema&quot;)## Getting startedYou can follow this recommended architecture for your code:```$WORKSPACE├── fs├── udata│   ├── ...│   └── setup.py│└── udata.cfg├── udata-front│   ├── ...│   └── setup.py└── udata-search-service    ├── ...    └── pyproject.toml```Clone the repository:```cd $WORKSPACEgit clone git@github.com:opendatateam/udata-search-service.git```Start the different services using docker-compose:```cd udata-search-servicedocker-compose up```This will start:- an elasticsearch- a search appInitialize the elasticsearch indices on setup.```# Locallyudata-search-service init-es# In the docker contextdocker-compose run --entrypoint /bin/bash web -c 'udata-search-service init-es'```This will create the following indices:- {UDATA_INSTANCE_NAME}-dataset-{yyyy}-{mm}-{dd}-{HH}-{MM}- {UDATA_INSTANCE_NAME}-reuse-{yyyy}-{mm}-{dd}-{HH}-{MM}- {UDATA_INSTANCE_NAME}-organization-{yyyy}-{mm}-{dd}-{HH}-{MM}Configure your udata to use the search service, by updating the following variables in your udata.cfg.Ex in local:```    SEARCH_SERVICE_API_URL = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/1/'```Using [udata](https://github.com/opendatateam/udata), when you modify objects,indexation messages will be sent to the search app and will be consumed by the API.If you want to reindex your local mongo base in udata, you can run:```cd $WORKSPACE/udata/source ./venv/bin/activateudata search index```Make sure to have the corresponding UDATA_INSTANCE_NAME specified in your udata settings.After a reindexation, you'll need to change the alias by using the following command:```# Locallyudata-search-service set-alias &lt;index-suffix&gt;# In the docker contextdocker-compose run --entrypoint /bin/bash web -c 'udata-search-service set-alias &lt;index-suffix&gt;'```You can query the search service with the search service api, ex: http://localhost:5000/api/1/datasets/?q=toilettes%20à%20rennes## DevelopmentYou can create a virtualenv, activate it and install the requirements with the following commands.```python3 -m venv venvsource venv/bin/activatemake depsmake install```You can start the web search service with the following command:```udata-search-service run```## DeploymentThe project depends on [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/index.html) 7.16.Elasticsearch requires the [Analysis ICU](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-analysis-icu)plugin for your specific version.On Debian, you can take a look at these[instructions](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.16/deb.html) for installation.## Troubleshooting- If the elasticsearch service exits with an error 137, it is killed due to out of memory error. You should read the following points.- If you are short on RAM, you can limit heap memory by setting `ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms750m -Xmx750m` as environment variable when starting the elasticsearch service.- If you are on MAC and still encounter RAM memory issues, you should increase Docker limit memory to 4GB instead of default 2GB.- If you are on Linux, you may need to double the vm.max_map_count. You can set it with the following command: `sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144`.- If you are on Linux, you may encounter permissions issues. You can either create the volume or change the user to the current user using `chown`. </longdescription>

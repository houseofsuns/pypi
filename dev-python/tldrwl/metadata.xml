It can understand images and express logical ideas about them, making it a powerful tool for education and personalized learning. The development of GPT-4 has been focused on making it safer, more aligned, and more useful for society, with internal guardrails around adversarial usage, unwanted content, and privacy concerns. The partnership with Microsoft aims to shape this technology into something that's trulyuseful for the world and can improve productivity, ultimately leading to a better quality of life. While limited, GPT-4 is an important step towards highly advanced and capable AI systems, and OpenAI hopes to make it useful to everyone, not just early adopters.Estimated cost (usd): $0.0016```## Features- [x] Summarize text with a single API call- [x] Summarize webpages with a single API call- [x] Summarize Youtube videos with a single API call- [ ] Summarize basic plain text file with a single API call- [ ] Summarize rich text file with a single API call- [ ] Summarize audio with a single API call- [x] Report number of tokens + cost per request- [x] Sync APIs- [x] Async APIs- [x] CLI- [x] CI/CD to publish to automatically PyPI## Caveats- Requires an OpenAI API key  - Export to env: `export OPENAI_API_KEY=&quot;&lt;your api key here&gt;&quot;`- Slow  - Small articles take ~20 seconds, longer articles and videos take a few minutes. There is probably some more optimization to be had.- Cost  - Can be expensive - by default, this uses the &quot;gpt-3.5-turbo&quot; model, which costs $0.002 / 1000 tokens.  - To minimize cost, the library currently limits the number of input characters to 120,000. This limits the cost of a request to a maximum of ~$0.062. In the future, I may add a flag to modify or remove this limit.  - If you pass `--cheap` to the command line, the ada model will be used, which is 5x cheaper, but not very good.To illustrate speed and cost: [This wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions) hits the maximum limit:```Running asyncSummary(text='The Wikipedia page &quot;List of common misconceptions&quot; provides a comprehensive list of popular misconceptions and myths in various fields, including arts and culture, business, food and cooking, history, science and mathematics, and film and television.

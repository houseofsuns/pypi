	<longdescription># Objectiv open model hubThe [open model hub](https://objectiv.io/docs/modeling/open-model-hub/) is a library of pre-built analytics models &amp; functions to build &amp; run deep analyses for a wide range of product &amp; marketing use cases. It’s part of [Objectiv](https://objectiv.io/), an open-source data collection &amp; modeling platform that helps data teams run product analytics from their notebooks. All models &amp; operations can run directly on a full dataset collected with the Objectiv Tracker without cleaning or transformation, as the data adheres to the [strict event typing &amp; validation of an open taxonomy](https://objectiv.io/docs/taxonomy/).Under the hood, the open model hub is powered by [Bach](https://pypi.org/project/objectiv-bach/), a Python-based analytics modeling library with a Pandas-like interface. Bach translates all operations and models to SQL, running directly on your full dataset. All DataFrames &amp; models can be converted to an SQL statement with just a single command, to use in other tools like dbt or BI.## Installation```pip install objectiv-modelhub```See how to [get started in your notebook](https://objectiv.io/docs/modeling/get-started-in-your-notebook/) for detailed installation instructions.## Usage* [Example notebooks with instructions](https://objectiv.io/docs/modeling/example-notebooks/)* [Open Model Hub API reference](https://objectiv.io/docs/modeling/open-model-hub/api-reference/)## Support* [Visit Objectiv Docs for instructions &amp; FAQs](https://objectiv.io/docs/)* [Join Objectiv on Slack to get help](https://objectiv.io/join-slack/)* [Request a feature or report an issue on Github](https://github.com/objectiv/objectiv-analytics)**Found a security issue?**Please don’t use the issue tracker but contact us directly.

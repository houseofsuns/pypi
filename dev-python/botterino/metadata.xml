	<longdescription># BotterinoBotterino allows automation of hosting and posting of /r/picturegame coordinates roundsWhen running botterino, if you win a round, your round will automatically be posted.It will reply with 'x' or '+correct' to any comments on your round automatically, with configurable tolerances.---## Pre-requisites0. All the files you interact with will live in the botterino-config folder which is located:    1. windows: `C:\Users\your username\botterino-config`    2. mac: `/Users/&lt;your username/botterino-config`    3. linux: `~/botterino-config`    These files are created for you the first time you run the bot1. You must have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your computer    1. If on windows it is best to install python from the [microsoft store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/python-39/9p7qfqmjrfp7?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)2. Install the bot    1. open a terminal or command prompt window and type the following command: `pip install botterino`3. You must [create a Reddit app](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/) and add authentication details in    `botterino-config/praw.ini`; see `sample-praw.ini` (on github) for an example    1. Give app any name you choose, such as 'botterino'    2. Choose 'script' as app type    3. Fill in 'redirect URI' with `http://localhost:8080` (This is irrelevant unless OAuth2 is used,but it's a required field)    4. Once created, you'll have a 'secret', copy/paste that as `client_secret` in botterino-config/praw.ini    5. You'll also have a less obvious client id, in the top left under the app name and the words 'personal use script' - copy/paste that into `client_id` in praw.ini4. Fill out the rest of 'botterino-config/praw.ini' with your Reddit username/password as well as anything you want for `user_agent`---## Usage- add round(s) in botterino-config/rounds/rounds.yaml. See sample-rounds.yaml on botterino github page for information on round syntax and types of features supported.- run with `python -m botterino`## UI:- The ui can be launched with `python -m botterino.ui`- Through the ui you can automatically populate rounds.yaml and start/stop the bot### Normal hostingRounds are kept in the 'rounds/rounds.yaml' file, see 'sample.yaml' for some examples#### Steps1. Add round(s) to 'botterino-config/rounds/rounds.yaml'2. Open a terminal or command prompt and type `python -m botterino`    1. Then all you have to do is win. Until you win, botterino will do nothing    2. When you win, the top round in rounds.yaml is posted as soon as you are approved to hostAny new rounds added to 'botterino-config/rounds/rounds.yaml' while the app is running will automatically be added to the queue, no need to restart.Once a round is complete, it will be moved to 'botterino-config/rounds/archive.yaml'.### Live roundsBotterino can be used on a round that is already liveThis is useful for cases where1. You post manually and decide you would like bot to host2. Bot posts for you but crashes during hosting for some reason#### Steps1. Will use the top round in rounds.yaml    1. `url` field should be omitted2. Run with `python -m botterino.failure`### Hints:Botterino can schedule hints and post them autmoatically.If the file `botterino-config/hints.txt` contains content,its content will be posted to the currently hosted round as a hintat the time specified by the user, and then the file is cleared.Default hint times can be specifiedin `botterino-config/config.ini`.The default value is `hints=[25,45]`.The default hint list can be overridden per round by adding the field`hints: [10, 20,30]` as a new field in rounds.yaml.Hint times are in minutes and are integers.Hints at hour boundaries do not need to be specified. If thehint file contains text it will be posted automatically at 60,120,180 etc...---## Misc### CustomizeOptions such as correct message and incorrect message can be customized in botterino-config/config.ini### UpdateUpdate this botterino with`pip install --upgrade botterino`### Issues* Bot does not run, crash message shows 403 error, everything in praw.ini looks correct    1. try a different user agent### Colors on windowsThis botterino uses colorful output. If you see strange output like this on windows![Strange windows output](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/768582651669381191/830607745769930762/unknown.png)then download [Windows terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?rtc=1)from the Microsoft store.</longdescription>

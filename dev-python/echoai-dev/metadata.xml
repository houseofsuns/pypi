	<longdescription># EchoAI DEV: The command line tool to interface with Generative AI## Install```bashpip install echoai-dev```## UsageYou can use this cli with either openai GPT or Anthropic Claude (through AWS Bedrock). To use GPT models, configure your OpenAI API token. ```bashexport OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...'```For Anthropic Claude models, use the aws cli to configure your environement by running the command: `aws config`Use the environment variable `ECHOAI_BACKEND` to define which backend model to use. This variable can take two values `bedrock` or `openai`. If the variable is not define, the default behavior is `openai`.Once that's done, you can use the `echoai` command-line tool to interface with Generative AI. Here is an example of how you can use it:```bashechoai &quot;Why does the Python live on land?&quot;```This will generate a response from the Generative AI that hopefully answers the question. Of course, the quality of the response will depend on the specific model and prompt used.&gt; Disclaimer: AI jokes may not be funny to human beings. Use at your own risk.### Azure OpenAI environment variables. The `echoai` cli works with the environment variables set for OpenAI. If you use Azure endpoints, you can set your `OPENAI_API_TYPE`, `_VERSION`, `_ENGINE` and `_BASE` according to your Azure project.## New features- [x] Support for AWS Bedrock (Claude models)- [ ] Read files from mentioned paths- [ ] Print code blocks to file</longdescription>

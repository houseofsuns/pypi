Its goalis to be simple and fast.* In comparison to certain other time freezing libraries, FreezeFrog doesn't  loop through all imported modules, making it fast even for larger projects.* FreezeFrog currently supports mocking the following basic methods:  * ``datetime.datetime.now``  * ``datetime.datetime.utcnow``  * ``time.time``* FreezeFrog supports both ``datetime`` and ``pytz`` timezone objects.Usage-----Use the ``FreezeTime`` context manager to freeze the time. Pass the desired``datetime`` object to the constructor, and the timezone to mock the system'stimezone (defaults to `datetime.timzone.utc`). The constructor also takes the``fold`` argument (``0`` by default), which defines whether an ambiguous timerefers to its first or second appearance, and the ``tick`` argument(``False`` by default), which makes the clock start ticking... code:: python  import datetime  from freezefrog import FreezeTime  with FreezeTime(datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 1)):      # The clock is frozen.      # Always prints 2014-01-01 00:00:00      print(datetime.datetime.utcnow())  with FreezeTime(datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 1), tick=True):      # The clock starts ticking immediately.      # Example output: 2014-01-01 00:00:00.000005      print(datetime.datetime.utcnow())</longdescription>

	<longdescription># good_cache`good_cache` is a Python library that caches the output of your functions. If your function has to read large files as its input or if it has to read files in a directory, and optionally some non-file function parameter values such as a str, int, bool, etc. values then `good_cache` can remember the input combination and return the ouput to the caller as long as the input combination has been seen (and cached) by `good_cache` previously.### Here is an article that goes into some detail about `good_cache`:- &lt;https://medium.com/@arunsundaramco/boost-your-python-efficiency-with-good-cache-file-and-directory-based-caching-made-simple-d2218365b3ca&gt;### Here is the GitHub repo:- &lt;https://github.com/arunsundaram50/good-cache&gt;### Here is the pip command to install it:```pip install good_cache```### Here’s a simple example of how you might use good_cache:```from good_cache import fs_files_cache@fs_files_cache(files='filenames')def sum_numbers_in_files(filenames):    result = 0    for filename in filenames:        with open(filename, 'rt') as file:            numbers = list(map(int, file.readlines()))            result += sum(numbers)    return result```### Here's an example of how you can evict a previous cache for a particular parameter(s)evicted = sum_numbers_in_files.evict(['a.txt', 'b.txt'])</longdescription>

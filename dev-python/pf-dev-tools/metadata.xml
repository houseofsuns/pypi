It provides tools used for building **openFPGA** cores and will also eventually be used to build **pfx** roms.Usage:```console  pf &lt;options&gt; command &lt;arguments&gt;```The following options are supported:```  --help/-h                             - Show a help message.  --version/-v                          - Display the app's version.  --debug/-d                            - Enable extra debugging information.```#### `clean` command```console  pf clean```Cleans the local project and deletes any intermediate build files. This should be executed in the same folder as the project's `SConstruct` file.#### `clone` command```console  pf clone &lt;url&gt; &lt;tag=name&gt; dest_folder```Clones the repo found at `url`, optionally at a given tag/branch named `name` into the folder `dest_folder`. 'url' does not need to be pre-fixed with `https://` or post-fixed with `.git`.If `url` is missing then `github.com/DidierMalenfant/pfCoreTemplate` is used.#### `convert` command```console  pf convert src_filename dest_filename```Converts an image to the openFGPA binary format used for core images and author icons.#### `delete` command```console  pf delete core_name &lt;dest_volume&gt;```Deletes all core data (bitstream, images, icons, json files) for core named `core_name` on volume &lt;dest_volume&gt;.If `dest_volume` is omitted then the command looks for the `PF_CORE_INSTALL_VOLUME` environment variable. If this is not defined either then it defaults to `/Volumes/POCKET` on **macOS** and errors out on other platforms.If another implementation of the core is found then the Platforms files will be kepts otherwise they are deleted too.#### `dryrun` command```console  pf dryrun```Simulate building the local project. This will give out information on what, if anything, needs to be rebuilt.This should be executed in the same folder as the project's `SConstruct` file.#### `eject` command```console  pf eject &lt;dest_volume&gt;```Ejects the volume at `dest_volume`. This command is currently only supported on **macOS**. If `dest_volume` is omitted then the command looks for the `PF_CORE_INSTALL_VOLUME` environment variable. If this is not defined either then it defaults to `/Volumes/POCKET`.#### `install` command```console  pf install zip_file &lt;dest_volume&gt;```Installs the packaged core contained in `zip_file` onto volume `dest_volume`.If `dest_volume` is omitted then the command looks for the `PF_CORE_INSTALL_VOLUME` environment variable. If this is not defined either then it defaults to `/Volumes/POCKET` on **macOS** and errors out on other platforms.#### make command```console  pf make```Builds the local project.This should be executed in the same folder as the project's `SConstruct` file.#### package command                                     ```console pf package config_file bistream_file dest_folder```Packages a core into a zip file according to the content of `config_file`. The format for the configuration can be found [below](#core-config-file-format). `bistream_file` is the path to a reversed bitstream file for the core. Resulting package is written in `dest_folder`.#### qfs command```console  pf qfs qsf_file &lt;cpus=num&gt; files...```Edits a **Quartus** `qfs` project file to add files and set number of cpu for the project. Updates the `qfs_file` by adding a list of **Verilog** `.v` or `.sv` `files`, separated by spaces.Optionally `cpus` can set the number of cpu cores that the compilation process can use. If `num` is `max` then all available **CPU** cores will be used.#### reverse command```console  pf reverse src_filename dest_filename```Reverses the bitstream file at `src_filename` and writes it to `dest_filename`.### Building an openFPGA core**pfDevTools** provides an entire toolchain needed to compile **openFPGA** cores. The build systems is based on the [**SCons**](https://scons.org) software construction tool which is entirely written in **Python**.A typical makefile is named `SConstruct` and for openFPGA projects can look as simple as this:```python  import pfDevTools  # -- We need pf-dev-tools version 1.x.x but at least 1.0.5.  pfDevTools.requires('1.0.5')  env = pfDevTools.SConsEnvironment()  env.OpenFPGACore('src/config.toml')```This will build, using `pf make`, a packaged core file based on the `toml` config [file](#core-config-file-format) and the source code found in the `src` folder.All projects should contain at least one `core/core_top.v` file at the root of their source tree. The content of this file should be based around **Analogue**'s own `core.top.v` [file](https://github.com/open-fpga/core-template/blob/main/src/fpga/core/core_top.v) but you do not need to provide any other files or **IP** found in the [core template](https://github.com/open-fpga/core-template). Those will be automatically brought in for you during the build.Good examples of simple core projects can be found in the examples provided as part of the [openFPGA tutorials](https://github.com/DidierMalenfant/openFPGA-tutorials).The build environment can be customized by passing variables to the `pfDevTools.SConsEnvironment()` method call like so:```python  env = pfDevTools.SConsEnvironment(PF_BUILD_FOLDER='MyBuildFolder', PF_SRC_FOLDER='MySrcFolder')```The following variables are currently supported:- `PF_DOCKER_IMAGE` - Name of the **Docker** image used to compile the core's bitstream. Defaults to `didiermalenfant/quartus:22.1-apple-silicon`.- `PF_SRC_FOLDER` - Root folder for all the **Verilog** source files for the project. Defaults to the folder where the `toml` config [file]](#core-config-file-format) is located.- `PF_BUILD_FOLDER` - Folder where intermediate build files are created. Defaults to `_build`.- `PF_CORE_TEMPLATE_REPO_URL` - Repo url to use instead of the default core template repo at `github.com/DidierMalenfant/pfCoreTemplate`.- `PF_CORE_TEMPLATE_REPO_TAG` - Repo tag to use to clone the core template repo.- `PF_CORE_TEMPLATE_REPO_FOLDER` - Path to a local core template folder to copy instead of cloning a repo.### Core config file formatCore configuration is done via a single `toml` file like this one:```[Platform]name = &quot;pfx-1&quot;image = &quot;assets/pfx1-platform-image.png&quot;short_name = &quot;pfx1&quot;category = &quot;Fantasy&quot;description = &quot;An open-source fantasy gaming console for the Analog Pocket.&quot;info = &quot;info.txt&quot;[Build]version = &quot;0.0.5&quot;[Author]name = &quot;dm&quot;icon = &quot;assets/pfx1-core-author-icon.png&quot;url = &quot;https://didier.malenfant.net/ProjectFreedom/&quot;[Video]width = 400height = 360aspect_w = 10aspect_h = 9rotation = 0mirror = 0```All the fields used here are similar to the ones found in **Analogue**'s own [core definition files](https://www.analogue.co/developer/docs/core-definition-files).### Calling the build system without the pf commandIn some cases, like when build is being called from inside an **IDE**, you may need to call the build system directly without using the `pf` command. You can do this by using the following equivalent commands:- '`scons -Q --quiet`' instead of '`pf make`'.- '`scons -Q --quiet install`' instead of '`pf install`'.- '`scons -c -Q --quiet`' instead of '`pf clean`'.### Pre-requisites**pfDevTools** requires at least [Python](https://python.org) 3.10. Make sure you have a [supported version](http://didier.malenfant.net/blog/nerdy/2022/08/17/installing-python.html) of **Python** before proceeding.It also uses the [git](https://git-scm.com) command. If you're on **macOS** and **Linux** this should come already built in on.Finally, if you wish to build openFPGA cores, you'll need to install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) on your machine.Make sure the **Docker Engine** is running while building the core. If you're running on an **Apple Silicon** Mac, also make sure that the feature `Use Rosetta for x86/amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon` is enabled in `Settings-&gt;Features in development`. This setting somehow turns itself off sometimes.### Installing Docker on Ubuntu LinuxMake sure that no other version of **Docker** are installed:```sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc```Add the docker repository:```sudo apt-get updatesudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupgsudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyringscurl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpgsudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpgecho &quot;deb [arch=&quot;$(dpkg --print-architecture)&quot; signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \  &quot;$(. /etc/os-release &amp;&amp; echo &quot;$VERSION_CODENAME&quot;)&quot; stable&quot; | \  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list &gt; /dev/null```Install the **Docker Engine**:```sudo apt-get updatesudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin```In order to be able to run `docker` without `sudo`, make sure the `docker` group exists and add your user to it:```sudo groupadd dockersudo usermod -aG docker $USERnewgrp docker```You can verify that the **Docker Engine** installation is successful by running the `hello-world` image:```docker run hello-world```### Trademarks**openFPGA** and the **openFPGA** logo are trademarks of [**Analogue**](https://www.analogue.co/) Enterprises Ltd.**Quartus** is a registered trademark of [**Intel**](https://intel.com/).This project is not affiliated, associated with, sponsored or supported by neither **Analogue** nor **Intel**.### License**pfDevTools** is distributed under the terms of the [GPLv3.0](https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-or-later.html) or later license.</longdescription>

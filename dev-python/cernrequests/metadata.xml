	<longdescription>[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/CMSTrackerDPG/cernrequests.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/CMSTrackerDPG/cernrequests)[![](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/cernrequests.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/cernrequests/)# CERN RequestsEnables using [`requests`](&quot;https://github.com/requests/requests&quot;) without having to configure the CERN Root certificates or getting an API access token manually.Inspired by [`certifi`](https://github.com/certifi/python-certifi), [`requests-kerberos`](https://github.com/requests/requests-kerberos), [`cern-sso-python`](https://github.com/cerndb/cern-sso-python) and [`api-access-examples`](https://gitlab.cern.ch/authzsvc/docs/api-access-examples/-/tree/master/python).The Root certificate bundle is copied from the [linuxsoft cern page](http://linuxsoft.cern.ch/cern/centos/7/cern/x86_64/repoview/CERN-CA-certs.html) and can also be created manually by downloading the CERN Grid Certification Authority files from [cafiles.cern.ch/cafiles](https://cafiles.cern.ch/cafiles/).## InstallationRequires ```Python 2.7``` or ```Python 3.4+``````bashpip install cernrequests```## Prerequisites### For sites requiring an SSL Grid certificateRequest a [Grid User Certificate](https://ca.cern.ch/ca/) (with password) and convert into public and private key:```bashmkdir -p ~/privateopenssl pkcs12 -in myCertificate.p12 -clcerts -nokeys -out ~/private/usercert.pem  # Will ask for the certificate passwordopenssl pkcs12 -in myCertificate.p12 -nocerts -nodes -out ~/private/userkey.pem  # Will ask for the certificate password```The `.pem` certificates have to be **passwordless**.### For CERN APIs using the &quot;&quot;new&quot;&quot; SSOAn `.env` file at the root of your project with the following variables set:- `SSO_CLIENT_ID`- `SSO_CLIENT_SECRET`(You can rename the `.env_sample` file to `.env` and add the values there).To request them, you will need to register your application:1. Create an SSO registration for your application    on the [CERN Application Portal](https://application-portal.web.cern.ch):    ![](doc/create_registration_01.png)2. Add an application identifier and description:    ![](doc/create_registration_02.png)    The `Application Identifier` can be anything, it's like a username for your application.t         Click `Submit`.3. Go back to the Application Portal and edit the SSO application (green button). Then, go to the `SSO Registration` tab and click the plus button:    ![](doc/create_registration_03.png)4. Fill out the form of the new SSO registration as follows:    ![](doc/create_registration_04.png)    - You can put any value in the `Redirect URI(s)`, e.g. `http://localhost/*`    - Same for the `Base URL`    - Make sure you click `My application will need to get tokens using its own client ID and secret`.5. Submit the form:    ![](doc/create_registration_05.png)    Note the `client id` and `client secret` that the form will show you.## Usage### Example#### With Grid Certificates```pythonimport cernrequestsurl = &quot;https://&lt;your-cern-website&gt;&quot;response = cernrequests.get(url)```#### With API TokenIf you want to access a website which requires a (&quot;&quot;new&quot;&quot;) CERN Single Sign-on token you can do the following:```pythonimport cernrequestsurl = &quot;https://&lt;your-cern-website-url&gt;&quot;reponse = cernrequests.get_with_token(url, target_audience=&quot;&lt;the SSO id of the target URL&gt;&quot;)```&gt; **Note**&gt; The `target_audience` depends on the SSO registration name of the _target_ application. E.g.&gt; if you want to access the development instance of Run Registry, `target_audience` should be &gt; `dev-cmsrunregistry-sso-proxy`. &gt; In case of doubt, communicate with the app's developers directly. #### Alternative usageIf you want to use ```requests``` directly without the CERN wrapper you can get the exact same functionality by doing:```pythonimport requestsfrom cernrequests import certsurl = &quot;https://&lt;your-cern-website&gt;&quot;cert = certs.default_user_certificate_paths()ca_bundle = certs.where()response = requests.get(url, cert=cert, verify=ca_bundle)```## Configuration### Grid certificatesThe default user certificate paths are first ```~\private\``` and ```~\.globus\``` for fallback. The default *public* key file name is ```usercert.pem``` and the default *private* key file name is ```userkey.pem```You can configure the default grid user certificate path by setting the ```CERN_CERTIFICATE_PATH``` environment variable.For example:```bashexport CERN_CERTIFICATE_PATH=${HOME}/my_custom_folder```This will still assume that your filenames are ```usercert.pem``` and ```userkey.pem```Write this line in your ```.bashrc``` to make the configuration persistent.Alternatively you can also specify the paths directly in your code:```pythonimport cernrequestsurl = &quot;https://&lt;your-cern-website&gt;&quot;cert = &quot;my/custom/path/cert.pem&quot;    # Public key pathkey = &quot;my/custom/path/key.pem&quot;      # Private key pathcernrequests.get(url, cert=(cert,key))```This way you can even use custom names such as ```cert.pem``` and ```key.pem```## Testing```bashpython -m venv venvsource venv/bin/activatepip install -r testing-requirements.txtpytest```## FAQ### I'm getting `certificate verify failed`! What should I do?The `cernrequests/cern-cacerts.pem` file has expired, and will need to be updated by the library maintainer. 1. ```bash    git clone https://gitlab.cern.ch/linuxsupport/rpms/cern-ca-certs/    cd cern-ca-certs/src    make    ```    This will create a `CERN-bundle.pem` file.2. Rename it to `cern-cacerts.pem` and replace the original `.pem` certificate chain.Verify that the certs work by running `pytest`.### I'm getting `403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://login.cern.ch/adfs/ls/auth/sslclient` errors!1 What should I do?1. Your grid certificate may have expired. Try creating a new one.2. You may be trying to access a CERN webpage using a grid certificate, but this method may be deprecated. Make sure that the web page allows SSL certificate authentication.## References- http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/- https://certifi.io/en/latest/- https://github.com/cerndb/cern-sso-python- https://linux.web.cern.ch/linux/docs/cernssocookie.shtml- http://linuxsoft.cern.ch/cern/centos/7/cern/x86_64/repoview/CERN-CA-certs.html- https://ca.cern.ch/ca/- https://auth.docs.cern.ch</longdescription>

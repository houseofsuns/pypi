	<longdescription># PANDEM - SourceIntegrate heterogeneous publuc health surveillance data sources into a coherent data base for PANDEM-2 project. ## DescriptionIdentify, map and integrate multiple pandemic related data into a coherent pandemic-management database. Developed within the H2020 project PANDEM-2, Pandem-Source allows users to systematically capture, standardize and analyze data coming from international and national surveillance databases, participatory surveillance projects, social networks and mass media. This tool is focused on flexibility so adding new sources or variables can be easily done as is required during a pandemic episode. ## Target usersPublic health data experts and data managers needing integrate several surveillance data.## ApproachData integration follow a semantic approach. Data sources need to be described using a Data Labelling Schema (DLS) file that specifies the acquisition chennel (URL, git, local file or script) the format and how to map the input data to Pandem-Source variables. If further customistions are needed, the user can define them using simple python scripts.The DLS ensures each source and variable is properly documented knwing its origin, meaning and data quality.## Supported sourcesPandem-Source is designed to be flexible and extensible so new sources can be easily added by end users. In order to demontstrate this principle. The following sources are supported Out of the Box### Sources for indicators- [COVID19 Data Hub](https://covid19datahub.io/) see [source definition](https://github.com/pandem2/pandem-source/blob/main/pandemsource/data/DLS/covid19-datahub.json)- [ECDC Atlas](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/surveillance-atlas-infectious-diseases) see [source definition](https://github.com/pandem2/pandem-source/blob/main/pandemsource/data/DLS/ecdc-atlas-influenza.json)- [ECDC COVID19 Datasets](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19/data) see source definitions for [variants](https://github.com/pandem2/pandem-source/blob/main/pandemsource/data/DLS/ecdc-covid19-variants.json), [age group](https://github.com/pandem2/pandem-source/blob/main/pandemsource/data/DLS/ecdc-covid19-age-group.json), [daily cases](https://github.com/pandem2/pandem-source/blob/main/pandemsource/data/DLS/ecdc-covid19-daily.json), [goverments measures](https://github.com/pandem2/pandem-source/blob/main/pandemsource/data/DLS/ecdc-covid19-measures.json), [vaccination](https://github.com/pandem2/pandem-source/blob/main/pandemsource/data/DLS/ecdc-covid19-vaccination.json)- [ECDC COVID19 Simulated data](https://github.com/maous1/Pandem2simulator) see [source definition](https://github.com/pandem2/pandem-source/blob/main/pandemsource/data/DLS/ecdc-covid19-age-group-variants.json)- [Serotracker](https://serotracker.com/en/Explore) see [source definition](https://github.com/pandem2/pandem-source/blob/main/pandemsource/data/DLS/serotracker.json)- [Open Sky Nerwork](https://opensky-network.org/) see [source definition](https://github.com/pandem2/pandem-source/blob/main/pandemsource/data/DLS/opensky-network-coviddataset.json)- [Influenza Net](http://www.influenzanet.info) see [source definition](https://github.com/pandem2/pandem-source/blob/main/pandemsource/data/DLS/influenza-net.json)- [MediSys](https://medisys.newsbrief.eu/medisys/) see [source definition](https://github.com/pandem2/pandem-source/blob/main/pandemsource/data/DLS/medisys.json)- [Twitter](https://twitter.com) see [source definition](https://github.com/pandem2/pandem-source/blob/main/pandemsource/data/DLS/twitter.json)- [User provided data](https://github.com/pandem2/pandem-source/blob/main/pandemsource/data/input-local-defaults/M.12%20Upload%20templates_end_users.xlsx?raw=true).

Please make sure you've installed *R 3.6.3 or higher*. If R is properly installed, please make sure you've also installed required dependencies with:(In your terminal)```bashsudo apt install libxml2-dev libsodium-dev libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev```(In the R interpreter)```Rinstall.packages(c(&quot;epitweetr&quot;, &quot;dplyr&quot;, &quot;shiny&quot;, &quot;plotly&quot;, &quot;DT&quot;, &quot;jsonlite&quot;, &quot;httr&quot;))```# PANDEM 2PANDEM-2 is a H2020 EU-funded project that aims to develop new solutions for efficient, EU-wide pandemic management. The goal of PANDEM-2 is to prepare Europe for future pandemics through innovations in training and to build capacity between EU member states responding to pandemics on a cross-border basis.</longdescription>

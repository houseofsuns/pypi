	<longdescription># soliddriver-checksA tool for ```KMP(Kernel Module Package)``` and ```installed/running kernel module``` checking, with this tool, users can have an overview of their KMP(s) and kernel modules status:- KMP (Kernel Module Package)  - ```Name```: Name of the KMP &lt;/br&gt;  - ```Path```: Path of the KMP’s location &lt;/br&gt;  - ```Vendor```: Who provides this KMP, considered as important issue if there’s no vendor information. &lt;/br&gt;  - ```Signature```: Signature of the KMP, considered as important issue if no signature. &lt;/br&gt;  - ```License```: License followed by the KMP, considered as critical issue if it’s not open sourced license. &lt;/br&gt;  - ```Weak Module Invoked```: The KMP should invoke weak-modules script to determines which modules are KAPI compatible with installed kernels and set up the symlinks. Otherwise it will be considered as critical issue. &lt;/br&gt;- Kernel Module  - ```Supported Flag```/```Signature```: All the kernel module should have “supported” flag and assigned “external” value to it, otherwise it’s not be supported by SUSE. And all the kernel module should have signature.If the value of “supported” flag is not “external”, or no “supported” flag or no signature, will be considered as critical issue.  &lt;/br&gt;    - The values of the flag respensent:      - ```yes```: This kernel module is supported by SUSE. But please confirm with SUSE if you're not sure if it's really supported by SUSE or the auther of the kernel module just put a ```yes``` on it.      - ```external```: This kernel module is supported by both vendor and SUSE.      - ```Missing or no```: The kernel module is not supported by SUSE, please contact the one who provide it to you for any issues. &lt;/br&gt;  - ```Symbols```: All the symbols in kernel module should be recorded in KMP, otherwise considered as critical issue. &lt;/br&gt;## What you can do with this report generaged by soliddriver-checks?Regarding the issues listed in the table, please contact your IHV(s) to fix it and follow  [Kernel Module Packages Manual](https://drivers.suse.com/doc/kmpm/) to build SUSE standard KMP.## InstallationFrom pypi: ```pip install soliddriver-checks```From RPM: the rpms can be found on [build.opensuse.org](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:huizhizhao:soliddriver-checks/soliddriver-checks)## Usage```Usage: soliddriver-checks [OPTIONS] [CHECK_TARGET]  Run checks against CHECK_TARGET.  CHECK_TARGET can be:    directory containing rpm files    &quot;system&quot; to check locally installed kernel modules    a config file listing remote systems to check (Please    ensure your remote systems are scp command accessable)    default is local systemOptions:  -f, --format [json|html|xlsx]    Specify output format, default is html,all  data can be saved in json format, html|xlsx           are optimized for better view. The                                  default output is $(pwd)/check_result.json  -o, --output TEXT               Output destination. Target can be filename                                  or point existing directory If directory,                                  files will be placed in the directory using                                  a autmatically generated filename. If target                                  is not an existing directory, file name is                                  assumed and output files will use the path                                  and file name specified. In either case, the                                  file extension will be automatically                                  appended matching on the output format```## Examples: - Check RPMs: &lt;/br&gt;   ```bash   # generate a html report for your rpm checks as default output.   soliddriver-checks /path/to/your/rpm/directory   ``` - Check all drivers on the system.    ```bash    # generate reports with html, excel, pdf format of your os.    soliddriver-checks    ```</longdescription>

	<longdescription>=====apyio=====*Async wrappers for standard Python io streams.*Example Usage=============For simple use cases this package provides the same high level utilities asthe Python `io` module:.. code-block:: python    import apyio    string_buff = apyio.StringIO()    bytes_buff = apyio.BytesIO()    file_handle = apyio.open('somefile.txt', 'r')The `write`, `writelines`, and `close` methods are left as normal functionsjust as they are for the asyncio streams. However, any function which mightresult in a read operation, such as `read`, `readline`, `readlines`, `read1`,`seek`, `tell`, and `truncate`, are now `async def` functions that must be`await`ed... code-block:: python    import apyio    async with apyio.open('somefile.txt', 'w') as file_handle:        file_handle.write('some data')        await file_handle.drain()  # Same as flush().    async with apyio.open('somefile.txt', 'r') as file_handle:        data = await file_handle.read()        print(data)    file_handle = apyio.open('somefile.txt', 'r')    async for line in file_handle:        print(line)For more advanced use cases, this package also contains async wrappers for allclasses defined in the Python `io` module. The wrappers are named using thepattern `Async&lt;&gt;Wrapper`. For example, `BufferedReader` becomes`AsyncBufferedReaderWrapper` and `FileIO` becomes `AsyncFileIOWrapper`. Allwrapper classes accept one argument in the constructor which must be theoriginal, synchronous stream... code-block:: python    import io    import apyio    sync_stream = io.FileIO('somefile.txt', 'r')    async_stream = apyio.AsyncFileIOWrapper(sync_stream)    print(sync_stream.readline())    print((await async_stream.readline()))If a file was opened using the built-in `open()` function it may not be aninstance of `io.FileIO`. Depending on the options given to `open()` differentkinds of streams may be returned. To help with wrapping arbitrary `open()`return values use the `apyio.wrap_file()` helper... code-block:: python    import apyio    file_handle = open('somefile.bin', 'r+b')    async_handle = apyio.wrap_file(file_handle)Testing=======All tests are stored in the '/tests' subdirectory. All tests are expected topass for Python 3.5 and above. To run tests create a virtualenv and installthe test-requirements.txt list. After that using the `tox` command will launchthe test suite.License=======    Copyright 2015 Kevin Conway    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the &quot;License&quot;);    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

Here are some tips forgetting your patch merged:Style-----As long as the code passes the PEP8 and PyFlakes gates then the style isacceptable.Docs----The PEP257 gate will check that all public methods have docstrings. If you'readding additional wrappers from the `io` module try to preserve the originaldocstrings if possible. If you're adding something new, like a helper function,try out the`napoleon style of docstrings &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinxcontrib-napoleon&gt;`_.Tests-----Make sure the patch passes all the tests. If you're adding a new feature don'tforget to throw in a test or two. If you're fixing a bug then definitely addat least one test to prevent regressions.</longdescription>

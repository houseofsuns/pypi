However, the standard libraries do not provide exactly what I need... Therefore, I decided to make my own library! Which will implement the functionality I need.I was inspired by the [colored-logs](https://pypi.org/project/colored-logs/) library.---*This library has been renamed to &quot;Mighty logger&quot;, but this library used to be called &quot;Qt Colored logger&quot;. You can search for old commits in this repository, but you can download the old build from the [link](https://pypi.org/project/qt-colored-logger/).*- [Content](#content)## OverviewThe library implements the formation of a beautifully formatted colored text, similar to a log, which has all the necessary information:- Device name and registered profile, system name, etc. (this data is displayed only once at the beginning of the logging)- Log entry time- Log entry category- Log entry type- Entry messageAny information to the output can be turned off (according to the default, everything is included). It is also possible to change the output settings during the logging process. It is possible to change the colors of the foreground text and the background, icons and animations.- [Content](#content)## LICENSEThe full text of the license can be found at the following [link](https://github.com/Nakama3942/mighty_logger/blob/master/LICENSE).&gt; Copyright © 2023 Kalynovsky Valentin.

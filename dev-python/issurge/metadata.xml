Words that start with any of these symbols will not be added to the title, except if they are in the middle (in that case, they both get added as tags/assignees/milestones and as a word in the title, without the prefix symbol)- **Tags:** Prefix a word with `~` to add a label to the issue- **Assignees:** Prefix with `@` to add an assignee. The special assignee `@me` is supported.- **Milestone:** Prefix with `%` to set the milestone- **Comments:** You can add comments by prefixing a line with `//`- **Description:** To add a description, finish the line with `:`, and put the description on another line (or multiple), just below, indented once more than the issue's line. Exemple:  ```  My superb issue ~some-tag:       Here is a description       I can skip lines  Another issue  ```  Note that you cannot have indented lines inside of the description (they will be ignored).#### Add some properties to multiple issuesYou can apply something (a tag, a milestone, an assignee) to multiple issues by indenting them below:```One issue~common-tag    ~tag1 This issue will have tags:        - tag1        - common-tag    @me this issue will only have common-tag as a tag.Another issue.```### One-shot modeYou can also create a single issue directly from the command line with `issurge new`.If you end the line with `:`, issurge will prompt you for more lines.```sh-session$ issurge new ~tag1 a tag right there @me :Please enter a description for the issue (submit 2 empty lines to finish):&gt; Basically allow users to enter an issue fragment directly on the command line with a subcommand, and if it expects a description, prompt for it&gt; &gt; Submitting add an interactive &quot;one-shot&quot;  (...) ~enhancement @me [...]Running gh issue new -t &quot;add an interactive \&quot;one-shot\&quot; mode&quot; -b &quot;Basically allow users to enter an issue fragment directly on the command line with a subcommand, and if it expects a description, prompt for it&quot; -a @me -l enhancement```</longdescription>

	<longdescription># ![Dreaming of integrated documentation](assets/icons8-ask-question-100.png) MkDocs semiliterate PluginThis plugin for [MkDocs](http://mkdocs.org) is an extension of Allison Thackston's excellent [mkdocs-simple-plugin](https://www.althack.dev/mkdocs-simple-plugin/). It allows you to include content from one file into another (via `{! ... !}` syntax), using exactly the same extraction specification that the `simple` plugin already uses for identifying documentation in source files.&lt;!-- repo: --&gt;&lt;!-- site: The current version of mkdocs-semiliterate is {! setup.cfg { extract: {start: name}, terminate: '(\d*\.\d*\.\d*)', ensurelines: false} !}. --&gt;&lt;!-- repo: --&gt;&lt;!-- site: It is built on mkdocs-simple-plugin v{! setup.cfg { extract: {start: 'mkdocs~=', stop: '(\d*\.\d*\.?\d*)'}, ensurelines: false} !}. --&gt;## RationaleTime and trends have not validated Knuth's original vision of &quot;literate programming&quot; as a mainstream practice. Nevertheless, there remain significant advantages to incorporating all documentation, including user-guide-style narrative, into the source code for a project. These advantages include ease of maintenance and synchronization of code and documentation, and opportunities to make the ensemble of your code and documentation more DRY. Thus, it's worth using a &quot;semiliterate&quot; programming style, in which* code is arranged as dictated by best software engineering practices* documentation is co-located in the same files next to the implementing code* and tools are provided for extracting and assembling that documentation into readable form.*[DRY]: Don't Repeat Yourself -- a coding philosophy of creating a single authoritative location for each piece of information.The `simple` plugin goes a long way toward creating a semiliterate programming environment. However, in creating narrative documentation, it's very useful to be able to quote or incorporate content --- whether that be documentation blocks or code examples or code that itself serves as documentation to avoid repeating information --- from one file into another. To satisfy that need, this `semiliterate` plugin extends (i.e, literally inherits from) the `simple` plugin and adds a syntax for such inclusion.With a few other small ease-of-use tweaks (documented in the &lt;!-- repo: --&gt;[Usage](http://studioinfinity.org/semiliterate/mkdocs_semiliterate/plugin)&lt;!-- site:[Usage](mkdocs_semiliterate/plugin.md) --&gt; section),this extended plugin aims to produce a lightweight but comprehensive semiliterate programming environment. &lt;!-- repo: --&gt;The [documentation site](http://studioinfinity.org/semiliterate)&lt;!-- site:This documentation site --&gt; is, of course, produced by MkDocs using the semiliterate plugin.## InstallationThe mkdocs-semiliterate package which provides the `semiliterate` plugin for MkDocs is available via PyPI:`python3 -m pip install mkdocs-semiliterate`or of course if your `pip` is already set up to use a Python 3.5 (or later) installation, just`pip install mkdocs-semiliterate`## License and AcknowledgmentsThis software is licensed under [Apache 2.0](LICENSE).

	<longdescription>Overview========Ploy is a commandline-tool to provision, manage and control server instances.There are plugins for EC2 (ploy_ec2), FreeBSD Jails (ploy_ezjail) and more.You can create, delete, monitor and ssh into instances while ploy handles the details like ssh fingerprint checking.Additional plugins provide advanced functionality like integrating Fabric (ploy_fabric) and Ansible (ploy_ansible).You can find the detailed documentation at http://ploy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Installation============ploy is best installed with easy_install, pip or with zc.recipe.egg in a buildout.It installs two scripts, ``ploy`` and ``ploy-ssh``.Configuration=============All information about server instances is located in ``ploy.conf``, which by default is looked up in ``etc/ploy.conf``.Plugins=======Support for backends and further functionality is implemented by plugins. One plugin is included with ploy.``plain``  For regular servers accessible via ssh.You can see which plugins are available in your current installation with ``ploy -v``.Plain-----With plain instances you can put infos about servers into the configuration to benefit from some ploy features like ssh fingerprint checking and plugins like the Fabric integration.Options~~~~~~~``host`` or ``ip``  (**required**) The host name or address for the server.``user``  The default user for ssh connections. If it's set to ``*`` then the current  local user name is used.``port``  The ssh port number.``ssh-host-keys`` or ``ssh-fingerprints``  (**required**) The public ssh host keys (or fingerprints) of the server.``ssh-host-keys``  It's best to use the public ssh host keys if available.  You can either specify the path, or put in the contents directly (``ssh-rsa AAAA...``).  Multiple host keys can be specified one per line, or separated by commas.``ssh-fingerprints``  If set to ``ask`` then manual interactive verification is enabled.  If set to ``ignore`` then no verification is performed at all!  Multiple fingerprints can be specified one per line, or separated by commas.  The format of fingerprints is either 16 bytes as hex numbers separated by colons,  the same 16 bytes prefixed by ``MD5:``,  or the hash type, followed by a colon and the base 64 encoded hash digest.``password-fallback``  If this boolean is true, then using a password as fallback is enabled if the  ssh key doesn't work. This is off by default.  You may be asked more than once for the password.  The first time is by paramiko which always happens, but is remembered.  The other times is by the ssh command line tool if it's invoked.``password``  Never use this directly! If password-fallback is enabled this password is  used. This is mainly meant for Fabric scripts which have other ways to get  the password. On use case is bootstrapping `FreeBSD &lt;http://www.freebsd.org/&gt;`_  from an `mfsBSD &lt;http://mfsbsd.vx.sk/&gt;`_ distribution where the password is  fixed.``proxycommand``  The command to use in the ProxyCommand option for ssh when using the ``ploy-ssh``  command. There are some variables which can be used:    ``path``      The directory of the ploy.conf file. Useful if you want to use the ``ploy-ssh``      command itself for the proxy.    ``known_hosts``      The absolute path to the known_hosts file managed by ploy.    ``instances``      The variables of other instances. For example: instances.foo.ip  In addition to these the variables of the instance itself are available.  A full example for a proxycommand::    proxycommand = {path}/../bin/ploy-ssh vm-master -W {ip}:22``ssh-key-filename``  Location of private ssh key to use.``ssh-extra-args``  A list of settings separated by newlines passed on to ssh.  Example::    ssh-extra-args = ForwardAgent yesSSH integration===============ploy provides an additional tool ``ploy-ssh`` to easily perform SSH basedoperations against named instances. Particularly, it encapsulates theentire *SSH fingerprint* mechanism. For example EC2 instances are oftenshort-lived and normally trigger warnings, especially, if you are usingelastic IPs.  Note:: it does so not by simply turning off these checks, but by transparently updating its own fingerprint list using mechanisms provided by the backend plugins.The easiest scenario is simply to create an SSH session with an instance. Youcan either use the ssh subcommand of the ploy tool like so::  ploy ssh INSTANCENAMEAlternatively you can use the ploy-ssh command directly, like so::  ploy-ssh INSTANCENAMEThe latter has been provided to support scp and rsync. Here are someexamples, you get the idea::  scp -S `pwd`/bin/ploy-ssh some.file demo-server:/some/path/  rsync -e &quot;bin/ploy-ssh&quot; some/path fschulze@demo-server:/some/pathInstance names==============Instances have an **id** which is the part after the colon in the configuration.They also have a **unique id** which has the form ``[masterid]-[instanceid]``.The ``[masterid]`` depends on the plugin.For plain instances it is ``plain``.The ``[instanceid]`` is the **id** of the instance.So, if you have the following config::  [plain-instance:foo]  ...Then the **unique id** of the instance is ``plain-foo``.Macro expansion===============In the ``ploy.conf`` you can use macro expansion for cleaner configurationfiles. That looks like this::  [ec2-instance:demo-server2]  &lt;= demo-server  securitygroups = demo-server2  [ec2-securitygroup:demo-server2]  &lt;= demo-serverAll the options from the specified macro are copied with some exceptions depending on the backend plugin.If you want to copy data from some other kind of options, you can add a colonin the macro name. This is useful if you want to have a base for instanceslike this::  [macro:base-instance]  keypair = default  region = eu-west-1  placement = eu-west-1a  [ec2-instance:server]  &lt;= macro:base-instance  ...Massaging of config values==========================Plugins and ploy massage certain string values from the config to convert them to other types and do formatting or expansion.You can use that yourself, which is useful for the Fabric integration and other things.Here is a simple example::  [section]  massagers =    intvalue=ploy.config.IntegerMassager    boolvalue=ploy.config.BooleanMassager  intvalue = 1  boolvalue = yesIf you now access those values from for example a fabric task, you get the correct type instead of strings.The above syntax registers the massagers only for that section.You can register massagers for other sections or even section groups with this syntax::  massagers =    [option]=[sectiongroup]:import.path.to.massager    [option]=[sectiongroup]:[section]:import.path.to.massagerThe parts have the following meaning:  ``[option]``    This is the name of the option which should be massaged  ``[sectiongroup]``    The name of the section group.    That's the part before the optional colon in a section.    To match sections without a colon, use ``global``.    To match every section, use ``*``.  ``[section]``    The name of the section to which this massager is applied.    If empty, the current section is used.Buildout specifics==================With zc.recipe.egg you can set a custom configfile location like this::  [ploy]  recipe = zc.recipe.egg  eggs = ploy  arguments = configpath=&quot;${buildout:directory}/etc/&quot;, configname=&quot;servers.cfg&quot;Changelog=========2.0.1 - 2023-06-19------------------* Fix ssh timeout handling.

[fschulze]* Dropped support ``ssh`` lib, only ``paramiko`` is supported.  [fschulze]* Dropped support for Python 2.6 and 3.3.  [fschulze]1.5.2 - 2018-08-20------------------* Stop testing on Python 3.3.  [fschulze]* Fix multiple masters for ``instance``.  [fschulze]1.5.1 - 2017-12-17------------------* Fix getting fingerprints automatically when ``ssh-host-keys`` is used.  [fschulze]1.5.0 - 2017-10-03------------------* New ``ssh-host-keys`` option which allows to set host keys directly to  force paramiko to use a specific key type to avoid fingerprint mismatches.  [fschulze]1.4.0 - 2017-10-02------------------* Allow instance implementations to return multiple fingerprints via  ``get_fingerprints`` method.  [fschulze]* Support other key types than just rsa, because paramiko &gt; 2 defaults to  ``ed25519``.  [fschulze]* Output more information about used keys on fingerprint mismatch.  [fschulze]1.3.1 - 2016-06-02------------------* Don't get ``ssh-fingerprints`` from master if not set in instance config.  This fixes automatic fingerprint fetching for EC2, ezjail etc.  [fschulze]1.3.0 - 2016-05-21------------------* Add option ``ssh-fingerprints`` which allows to specify multiple fingerprints.  [fschulze]* Support new output of ``ssh-keygen`` which includes the hash type and  defaults to ``SHA256``.  [fschulze]1.2.1 - 2015-08-27------------------* Allow to specify multiple masters per instance.  [fschulze]1.2.0 - 2015-03-05------------------* Add ``Executor`` helper to handle local and remote command execution. It's  also handling ssh agent forwarding enabled by either the users ssh config  or the ``ssh-extra-args`` option.  [fschulze]1.1.0 - 2015-02-28------------------* Add ``ssh-extra-args`` option.  [fschulze]* Add ``annotate`` command to print the configuration with the source of each  setting.  [fschulze]* Allow custom shebang in gzipped startup scripts.  [fschulze]1.0.3 - 2015-01-22------------------* Drop bad entries from our ``known_hosts`` file to prevent failures  in paramiko.  [fschulze]* Set ``StrictHostKeyChecking=yes`` for all ssh connections to prevent  interactive asking.  [fschulze]1.0.2 - 2014-10-04------------------* Ask before terminating an instance.  [fschulze]* Fix config setting propagation in some cases of proxied instances.  [fschulze]* Close all connections before exiting. This prevents hangs caused by open  proxy command threads.  [fschulze]* Add option to log debug output.  [fschulze]* Add helpers to setup proxycommand in plugins.  [fschulze]1.0.1 - 2014-08-13------------------* Fix error output for plain instances on ssh connection failures.  [fschulze]1.0.0 - 2014-07-19------------------* Fix removal of bad host keys when using non standard ssh port.  [fschulze]* Renamed ``plain-master`` to ``plain``, so the uids of instances are nicer.  [fschulze]1.0rc15 - 2014-07-16--------------------* Only remove bad host key from known_hosts instead of clearing it completely.  [fschulze]* Removed support for ``proxyhost`` option. It caused hangs and failures on  missing or invalid ssh fingerprints.  [fschulze]* Allow empty ``startup_script`` option to mean use no startup script.  [fschulze]1.0rc14 - 2014-07-15--------------------* Allow ``fingerprint`` to be set to a public host key file.  [fschulze]1.0rc13 - 2014-07-08--------------------* Better error message for instances missing because the plugin isn't installed.  [fschulze]* Fix tests when ploy itself isn't installed.  [fschulze]1.0rc12 - 2014-07-08--------------------* Use plain conftest.py instead of pytest plugin.  [fschulze]1.0rc11 - 2014-07-05--------------------* Fix uid method for master instances.  [fschulze]1.0rc10 - 2014-07-04--------------------* Print plugin versions with ``-v`` and ``--versions``.  [fschulze]* Python 3 compatibility.  [fschulze]1.0rc9 - 2014-06-29-------------------* Let plugins add type of lists to show with the ``list`` command.  [fschulze]* Use ``server`` and ``instance`` consistently.  [fschulze]* Always make instances accessible by their full name in the form of  &quot;[master_id]-[instance_id]&quot;. Only if there is no conflict, the short version  with just &quot;[instance_id]&quot; is also available for convenience.  [fschulze]* Add instance id validator which limits to letters, numbers, dashes and  underscores.  [fschulze]* Renamed from mr.awsome to ploy.  [fschulze]1.0rc8 - 2014-06-16-------------------* Give a bit more info on ssh connection failures.  [fschulze]1.0rc7 - 2014-06-11-------------------* Expose some test fixtures for reuse in plugins.  [fschulze]* Add before_terminate and after_start hooks and make it simple for plugins  to add their own hooks.  [fschulze]1.0rc6 - 2014-06-10-------------------* Add ``get_path`` method to ConfigSection class.  [fschulze]1.0rc5 - 2014-06-09-------------------* Provide helper method ``ssh_args_from_info`` on BaseInstance to get the  arguments for running the ssh executable from the info provided by  init_ssh_key.  [fschulze]* Allow overwriting the command name in help messages for bsdploy.  [fschulze]* Make debug command usable for instances that don't have a startup script.  [fschulze]* Instances can provide a get_port method to return a default port.  [fschulze]* Catch socket errors in init_ssh_key of plain instances to print additional  info for debugging.  [fschulze]* Delay setting of config file path to expose too early use of config in  plugins. Refs #29  [fschulze]1.0rc4 - 2014-05-21-------------------* Fix massagers for ``[instance:...]`` sections.  [fschulze]* Copy massagers in ConfigSection.copy, so overrides in startup script work  correctly.  [fschulze]1.0rc3 - 2014-05-15-------------------* Fetch fingerprints only when necessary. This speeds up connections when the  fingerprint in known_hosts is still valid.  [fschulze]1.0rc2 - 2014-05-14-------------------* Moved setuptools-git from setup.py to .travis.yml, it's only needed for  releases and testing.  [fschulze]* More tests.  [fschulze]1.0rc1 - 2014-03-23-------------------* Test, enhance and document adding massagers via config.  [fschulze]* Moved ec2 and fabric integration into separate plugins.  [fschulze]* You can now have instances with the same name if the belong to different  masters, they will then get the name of the master as a prefix to their name.  [fschulze]* Add possibility to overwrite the default config name.  [tomster]* Improved ``proxycommand`` and documented it.  [fschulze]* Make the AWS instance available in masters. This changes the ``get_masters``  plugin interface.  [fschulze]* Use os.execvp instead of subprocess.call. This allows the use of ``assh`` in  the ``proxycommand`` option, which greatly simplifies it's use.  [fschulze]* Added command plugin hooks.  [fschulze]* The variable substitution for the ``proxycommand`` option now makes the other  instances available in a dict under ``instances``. And adds ``known_hosts``.  [fschulze]* Load plugins via entry points instead of the ``plugin`` section in the config.  [fschulze]* Allow fallback to password for ssh to plain instances.  [fschulze]* Add option to ask for manual fingerprint validation for plain instances.  [fschulze]0.13 - 2013-09-20-----------------* Use os.path.expanduser on all paths, so that one can use ~ in config values  like the aws keys.  [fschulze]0.12 - 2013-09-11-----------------* There is no need to add the AWS account id to security group names anymore.  [fschulze]* Rules are removed from security groups if they aren't defined in the config.  [fschulze]* Allow adding of custom config massagers from inside the config.  [fschulze]* Support block device maps to enable use of more than one ephemeral disk.  [fschulze]* Added ``do`` method on ec2 and plain instances which allows to call fabric  commands.  [fschulze]* Use PathMassager for ``access-key-id`` and ``secret-access-key`` in the  ``ec2-master`` section. This might break existing relative paths for these  options.  [fschulze]* Added support for EBS boot instances.  [fschulze]* Add option ``ssh-key-filename`` to point to a private ssh key for ec2 and  plain instances.  [fschulze]* Fix Fabric integration for newer versions of Fabric.  [fschulze]* Support ``proxycommand`` option for plain instances. This also caused a  change in the ``init_ssh_key`` API for plugins.  [fschulze]* Support ``ProxyCommand`` from ``~/.ssh/config`` for plain instances.  Requires Fabric 1.5.0 and Paramiko 1.9.0 or newer.  [fschulze]0.11 - 2012-11-08-----------------* Support both the ``ssh`` and ``paramiko`` libraries depending on which  Fabric version is used.  [fschulze]0.10 - 2012-06-04-----------------* Added ``ec2-connection`` which helps in writing Fabric scripts which don't  connect to a server but need access to the config and AWS (like uploading  something to S3).  [fschulze]* Fix several problems with using a user name other than ``root`` for the  ``do`` and ``ssh`` commands.  [fschulze]* Require Fabric &gt;= 1.3.0.  [fschulze]* Require boto &gt;= 2.0.  [fschulze]* Added hook for startup script options.  [fschulze]* Added possibility to configure hooks.  [fschulze]* Refactored to enable plugins for different virtualization or cloud providers.  [fschulze]* Added lots of tests.  [fschulze]0.9 - 2010-12-09----------------* Overwrites now also affect server creation, not just the startup script.  [fschulze]* Added ``list`` command which supports just listing ``snapshots`` for now.  [fschulze]* Added ``delete-volumes-on-terminate`` option to delete volumes created from  snapshots on instance termination.  [fschulze]* Added support for creating volumes from snapshots on instance start.  [natea, fschulze]* Added support for ``~/.ssh/config``. This is a bit limited, because the  paramiko config parser isn't very good.  [fschulze]* Added ``help`` command which provides some info for zsh autocompletion.  [fschulze]0.8 - 2010-04-21----------------* For the ``do`` command the Fabric options ``reject_unknown_hosts`` and  ``disable_known_hosts`` now default to true.  [fschulze]* Allow adding normal servers to use with ``ssh`` and ``do`` commands.  [fschulze]* Refactored ssh connection handling to only open network connections when  needed. Any fabric option which doesn't need a connection runs right away  now (like ``-h`` and ``-l``).  [fschulze]* Fix status output after ``start``.  [fschulze]0.7 - 2010-03-22----------------* Added ``snapshot`` method to Server class for easy access from fabfiles.  [fschulze]0.6 - 2010-03-18----------------* It's now possible to specify files which contain the aws keys in the  ``[aws]`` section with the ``access-key-id`` and ``secret-access-key``  options.  [fschulze]* Added ``-c``/``--config`` option to specify the config file to use.  [fschulze]* Added ``-v``/``--version`` option.  [tomster (Tom Lazar), fschulze]* Comment lines in the startup script are now removed before any variables  in it are expanded, not afterwards.  [fschulze]* Use argparse library instead of optparse for more powerful command line  parsing.  [fschulze]0.5 - 2010-03-11----------------* Added gzipping of startup script by looking for ``gzip:`` prefix in the  filename.  [fschulze]* Added macro expansion similar to zc.buildout 1.4.  [fschulze]0.4 - 2010-02-18----------------* Check console output in ``status`` and tell user about it.  [fschulze]* Friendly message instead of traceback when trying to ssh into an unavailable  server.  [fschulze]* Remove comment lines from startup script if it's starting with ``#!/bin/sh``  or ``#!/bin/bash``.  [fschulze]* Removed ``-r`` option for ``start`` and ``debug`` commands and replaced it  with more general ``-o`` option.  [fschulze]* Made startup script optional (not all AMIs support it, especially Windows  ones).  [fschulze]* The ``stop`` command actually only stops an instance now (only works with  instances booted from an EBS volume) and the new ``terminate`` command now  does what ``stop`` did before.  [fschulze]* Better error message when no console output is available for ssh finger  print validation.  [fschulze]* Fixed indentation in documentation.  [natea (Nate Aune), fschulze]0.3 - 2010-02-08----------------* Removed the ``[host_string]`` prefix of the ``do`` command output.  [fschulze]0.2 - 2010-02-02----------------* Snapshots automatically get a description with date and volume id.  [fschulze]* The ssh command can now be used with scp and rsync.  [fschulze]0.1 - 2010-01-21----------------* Initial release  [fschulze]</longdescription>

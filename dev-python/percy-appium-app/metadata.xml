It should ideally work on all Python 3.6+ versions[NOTE] Appium-Python-Client(&gt;= v2.9.0) is having compatibility issues with urllib3 latest versions. To solve the issue it is recommended to add `urllib3&gt;=1.26.15,&lt;2` in your requirements.txt file.## UsageThis is an example test using the `percy_screenshot` function.``` pythonfrom appium import webdriverfrom percy import percy_screenshotdriver = webdriver.Remote(&quot;https://&quot; + userName + &quot;:&quot; + accessKey + &quot;@hub-cloud.browserstack.com/wd/hub&quot;, desired_caps)# take a screenshotpercy_screenshot(driver, 'here is some name')```Running the test above normally will result in the following log:```sh-session[percy] Percy is not running, disabling screenshots```When running with [`percyapp:exec`](https://github.com/percy/cli/tree/master/packages/cli-exec#app-exec), and your project's`PERCY_TOKEN`, a new Percy build will be created and screenshots will be uploaded to your project.```sh-session$ export PERCY_TOKEN=[your-project-token]$ percy app:exec -- [python test command][percy] Percy has started![percy] Created build #1: https://percy.io/[your-project][percy] Screenshot taken &quot;Python example&quot;[percy] Stopping percy...[percy] Finalized build #1: https://percy.io/[your-project][percy] Done!```## Configuration`percy_screenshot(driver, name[, **kwargs])`- `driver` (**required**) - A appium driver instance- `name` (**required**) - The screenshot name; must be unique to each screenshot- `device_name` (**optional**) - The device name used for capturing screenshot- `orientation` (**optional**) - Orientation of device while capturing screeenshot; Allowed values [`portrait` | `landscape`]- `status_bar_height` (**optional**) - Height of status bar; int- `nav_bar_height` (**optional**) - Height of navigation bar; int- `fullpage` (**optional**) - [Alpha] Only supported on App Automate driver sessions [ needs @percy/cli 1.20.2+ ]; boolean  - `screen_lengths` (**optional**) - [Alpha] Max screen lengths for fullPage; int  - In case scrollview is overlapping with other app elements. Offsets can be provided to reduce the area which needs to be considered for scrolling:    - `top_scrollview_offset`: (**optional**) - [Alpha] Offset from top of scrollview; int    - `bottom_scrollview_offset` (**optional**) - [Alpha] Offset from bottom of scrollview; int- `full_screen` (**optional**) - Indicate whether app is full screen; boolean [ needs @percy/cli 1.20.2+ ];- `scrollable_xpath` (**optional**) - [Alpha] Scrollable element xpath for fullpage [ needs @percy/cli 1.20.2+ ]; string- `scrollable_id` (**optional**) - [Alpha] Scrollable element accessibility id for fullpage [ needs @percy/cli 1.20.2+ ]; string- `ignore_regions_xpaths` (**optional**) - Elements xpaths that user want to ignore in visual diff [ needs @percy/cli 1.23.0+ ]; list of string- `ignore_region_accessibility_ids` (**optional**) - Elements accessibility_ids that user want to ignore in visual diff [ needs @percy/cli 1.23.0+ ]; list of string- `ignore_region_appium_elements` (**optional**) - Appium elements that user want to ignore in visual diff [ needs @percy/cli 1.23.0+ ]; list of appium element object- `custom_ignore_regions` (**optional**) - Custom locations that user want to ignore in visual diff [ needs @percy/cli 1.23.0+ ]; list of ignore_region object  - IgnoreRegion:-    - Description: This class represents a rectangular area on a screen that needs to be ignored for visual diff.    - Constructor:      ```      init(self, top, bottom, left, right)      ```    - Parameters:      - `top` (int): Top coordinate of the ignore region.      - `bottom` (int): Bottom coordinate of the ignore region.      - `left` (int): Left coordinate of the ignore region.      - `right` (int): Right coordinate of the ignore region.## Running with Hybrid AppsFor a hybrid app, we need to switch to native context before taking screenshot.- Add a helper method similar to following for say flutter based hybrid app:```pythondef percy_screenshot_flutter(driver, name: str, **kwargs):  driver.switch_to.context('NATIVE_APP')  percy_screenshot(driver, name, **kwargs)  driver.switch_to.context('FLUTTER')```- Call PercyScreenshotFlutter helper function when you want to take screenshot.```pythonpercy_screenshot_flutter(driver, name, **kwargs)```&gt; Note: &gt;&gt; For other hybrid apps the `driver.switch_to.context('FLUTTER')` would change to context that it uses like say WEBVIEW etc.&gt;## Running Percy on Automate`percy_screenshot(driver, name, options)` [ needs @percy/cli 1.27.0-beta.0+ ];- `driver` (**required**) - A appium driver instance- `name` (**required**) - The screenshot name; must be unique to each screenshot- `options` (**optional**) - There are various options supported by percy_screenshot to server further functionality.    - `freeze_animated_image` - Boolean value by default it falls back to `false`, you can pass `true` and percy will freeze image based animations.    - `freeze_image_by_selectors` -List of selectors. Images will be freezed which are passed using selectors. For this to work `freeze_animated_image` must be set to true.    - `freeze_image_by_xpaths` - List of xpaths. Images will be freezed which are passed using xpaths. For this to work `freeze_animated_image` must be set to true.    - `percy_css` - Custom CSS to be added to DOM before the screenshot being taken. Note: This gets removed once the screenshot is taken.    - `ignore_region_xpaths` - List of xpaths. elements in the DOM can be ignored using xpath    - `ignore_region_selectors` - List of selectors. elements in the DOM can be ignored using selectors.    - `ignore_region_appium_elements` - List of appium web-element. elements can be ignored using appium_elements.    - `custom_ignore_regions` -  List of custom objects. elements can be ignored using custom boundaries. Just passing a simple object for it like below.      - example: ```{&quot;top&quot;: 10, &quot;right&quot;: 10, &quot;bottom&quot;: 120, &quot;left&quot;: 10}```      - In above example it will draw rectangle of ignore region as per given coordinates.          - `top` (int): Top coordinate of the ignore region.          - `bottom` (int): Bottom coordinate of the ignore region.          - `left` (int): Left coordinate of the ignore region.          - `right` (int): Right coordinate of the ignore region.    - `consider_region_xpaths` - List of xpaths. elements in the DOM can be considered for diffing and will be ignored by Intelli Ignore using xpaths.    - `consider_region_selectors` - List of selectors. elements in the DOM can be considered for diffing and will be ignored by Intelli Ignore using selectors.    - `consider_region_appium_elements` - List of appium web-element. elements can be considered for diffing and will be ignored by Intelli Ignore using appium_elements.    - `custom_consider_regions` - List of custom objects. elements can be considered for diffing and will be ignored by Intelli Ignore using custom boundaries      - example:```{&quot;top&quot;: 10, &quot;right&quot;: 10, &quot;bottom&quot;: 120, &quot;left&quot;: 10}```      - In above example it will draw rectangle of consider region will be drawn.      - Parameters:        - `top` (int): Top coordinate of the consider region.        - `bottom` (int): Bottom coordinate of the consider region.        - `left` (int): Left coordinate of the consider region.        - `right` (int): Right coordinate of the consider region.### Creating Percy on automate buildNote: Automate Percy Token starts with `auto` keyword. The command can be triggered using `exec` keyword.```sh-session$ export PERCY_TOKEN=[your-project-token]$ percy exec -- [python test command][percy] Percy has started![percy] [Python example] : Starting automate screenshot ...[percy] Screenshot taken &quot;Python example&quot;[percy] Stopping percy...[percy] Finalized build #1: https://percy.io/[your-project][percy] Done!```Refer to docs here: [Percy on Automate](https://docs.percy.io/docs/integrate-functional-testing-with-visual-testing)### Migrating ConfigIf you have a previous Percy configuration file, migrate it to the newest version with the[`config:migrate`](https://github.com/percy/cli/tree/master/packages/cli-config#percy-configmigrate-filepath-output) command:```sh-session$ percy config:migrate```</longdescription>

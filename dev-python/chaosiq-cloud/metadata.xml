First, go there and generate a new token. Copy thattoken and paste it when asked from the next command:```console$ chaos signinChaosIQ url [https://console.chaosiq.io]: ChaosIQ token: Here are your known organizations:1) yourorg2) TeamA3) TeamBDefault organization to publish to: 2Experiments and executions will be published to organization 'TeamA'ChaosIQ details saved at ~/.chaostoolkit/settings.yaml```This is now ready to be used.### Change ChaosIQ Organization[ChaosIQ][chaosiq] has support for multiple organizations. You can specify which of the organizations that you want the ChaosIQ extension to useby  executing the `org` command:```console$ chaos orgHere are your known organizations:1) yourorg2) TeamA3) TeamBDefault organization to publish to: 3Experiments and executions will be published to organization 'TeamB'ChaosIQ details saved at ~/.chaostoolkit/settings.yaml```This is now ready to be used.### Publish experiments and executions as you runOnce this extension is installed, it starts transmitting the experimentsand their executions to the [ChaosIQ][chaosiq] in your selected organization.```console$ chaos run test.json[2019-09-25 14:42:34 INFO] Validating the experiment's syntax[2019-09-25 14:42:34 INFO] Experiment looks valid[2019-09-25 14:42:34 INFO] Running experiment: EC2 instances are self-healing[2019-09-25 14:42:35 INFO] Execution available at https://console.chaosiq.io/TeamB/executions/f2133988-a6c0-4c48-ac29-c167cea078c5[2019-09-25 14:42:35 INFO] Steady state hypothesis: EC2 instance self-heals[2019-09-25 14:42:36 INFO] Probe: there-should-be-one-running-instance[2019-09-25 14:42:39 INFO] Steady state hypothesis is met![2019-09-25 14:42:40 INFO] Action: stopping-instance-now[2019-09-25 14:42:41 INFO] Pausing after activity for 5s...[2019-09-25 14:42:47 INFO] Steady state hypothesis: EC2 instance self-heals[2019-09-25 14:42:48 INFO] Probe: there-should-be-one-running-instance[2019-09-25 14:42:50 CRITICAL] Steady state probe 'there-should-be-one-running-instance' is not in the given tolerance so failing this experiment[2019-09-25 14:42:50 INFO] Let's rollback...[2019-09-25 14:42:50 INFO] Rollback: starting-instance-again[2019-09-25 14:42:51 INFO] Pausing before next activity for 15s...[2019-09-25 14:43:06 INFO] Action: starting-instance-again[2019-09-25 14:43:08 INFO] Experiment ended with status: deviated[2019-09-25 14:43:08 INFO] The steady-state has deviated, a weakness may have been discovered```### Publish existing executionThe `publish` command enables you to manually push your experimental findings, typically recorded in the `journal.json`, to your ChaosIQorganization.### Disable safe guards checkingDuring development time of your experiment, you may wish to disable checkingfor safeguards as they can slow your work down. They aren't always relevanteither. To disable the extension from requesting if the execution is allowedto carry on:```console$ chaos disable safeguards```Obviously, run the mirroring command to enable them back:```console$ chaos enable safeguards```### Disable publishing experiments and executionsIf you need to disable publishing for a little while:```console$ chaos disable publish```Note, when you disable publishing, you essentialy disable the entire extension.Obviously, run the mirroring command to enable publishing again:```console$ chaos enable publish```### Run a system verificationA system verification is a chaos experiment with an extension block added such as the following:```javascript...  &quot;extensions&quot;: [        {            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;chaosiq&quot;,            &quot;verification&quot;: {                &quot;id&quot;: &quot;SOME_GUID&quot;,                &quot;warm-up-duration&quot;: 2,                &quot;frequency-of-measurement&quot;: 2,                &quot;duration-of-conditions&quot;: 10,                &quot;cool-down-duration&quot;: 2            }        }    ],...```Typically you would create a verification in your [ChaosIQ console][console]. You can execute a verification in exactly the same way as the [`chaos run`][run] default command in the Chaos Toolkit, but instead of `chaos run` you will use `chaos verify`:[console]: https://console.chaosiq.io[run]: https://docs.chaostoolkit.org/reference/usage/run/```console$ chaos verify my-excellent-verification.json```As with Chaos Toolkit experiments, system verifications may be specified in JSON or YAML formats.## ContributeContributors to this project are welcome as this is an open-source effort thatseeks [discussions][join] and continuous improvement.[join]: https://join.chaostoolkit.org/From a code perspective, if you wish to contribute, you will need to run a Python 3.5+ environment. Then, fork this repository and submit a PR. Theproject cares for code readability and checks the code style to match bestpractices defined in [PEP8][pep8]. Please also make sure you provide testswhenever you submit a PR so we keep the code reliable.[pep8]: https://pycodestyle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/### DevelopIf you wish to develop on this project, make sure to install the developmentdependencies. But first, [create a virtual environment][venv] and then installthose dependencies.[venv]: http://chaostoolkit.org/reference/usage/install/#create-a-virtual-environment```console$ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt -r requirements.txt```Then, point your environment to this directory:```console$ pip install -e .```Now, you can edit the files and they will be automatically be seen by yourenvironment, even when running from the `chaos` command locally.Don't forget to run the linter regularly:```$ pylama chaoscloud```### TestTo run the tests for the project execute the following:```$ pytest```### ReleaseIn order to release this package, you must first bump its version in`chaoscloud/__init__.py` as well as the CHANGELOG. Commit and push thesechanges. Then run the followings:```$ git tag VERSION$ git push origin VERSION```where `VERSION` is the semantic version you set in `chaoscloud/__init__.py`.Once the tag was built, it should have released the package on Pypi.</longdescription>

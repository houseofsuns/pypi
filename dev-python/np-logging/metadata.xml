	<longdescription># np_logging### *For use on internal Allen Institute network*## Quick startFollow the conventions for using the `logging` module in the standard library: - in a script or main module, `np_logging` adds console &amp; file handlers and exit messages to the root logger:```pythonimport np_logginglogger = np_logging.getLogger()``` - or, in a package or project with multiple modules, all logged messages are propagated to the root logger:```pythonimport np_logginglogger = np_logging.getLogger(__name__)     # logger.level = logging.NOTSET = 0``` - then log messages as usual:```python logger.info('test message')logger.warning('test message')```No further setup is required, and importing `logging`from the standard library isn't necessary.***To send a message to the Mindscope log-server, use `np_logging.web()` and supply a project name, which willappear in the `channel` field on the server:```pythonproject_name = 'spike_sorting'np_logging.web(project_name).info('test message')```- the web log can be viewed at [http://eng-mindscope:8080](http://eng-mindscope:8080)***For customization, use `np_logging.setup()` to supply a logging config dict that specifiesloggers and their handlers &amp; formatters, and np_logging will add extra functionality such as exit messages/emails.- logging configs should be specified according to the python logging [library dict schema](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.config.html#logging-config-dictschema)- logging configs on the `eng-mindscope` ZooKeeper server can also be used directly to setup  logging by supplying their path to `np_logging.setup()`:```pythonnp_logging.setup(    '/projects/np_workflows/defaults/logging')```See [np_config](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/np_config) for further info on using ZooKeeperfor configs.Other input arguments to `np_logging.setup()`:- `project_name` (default: current working directory name)       - sets the `channel` displayed on the log server- `email_address` (default: `None`)          - if one or more addresses are supplied, an email is sent at program exit reporting the      elapsed time and cause of termination. If an exception was raised, the      traceback is included.- `log_at_exit` (default: `True`)    - If `True`, a message is logged when the program terminates, reporting total      elapsed time.- `email_at_exit` (default: `False`, or `True` if `email_address` is not `None`)    - If `True`, an email is sent when the program terminates.          - If `logging.ERROR`, the email is only sent if the program terminates via an exception.</longdescription>

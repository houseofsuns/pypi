	<longdescription># airflow-mcdMonte Carlo's alpha Airflow provider.## InstallationRequires Python 3.7 or greater and is compatible with Airflow 1.10.14 or greater.You can install and update using pip. For instance:```pip install -U airflow-mcd```This package can be added like any other python dependency to Airflow (e.g. via `requirements.txt`).## Basic usage### Hooks:- **SessionHook**    Creates a [pycarlo](https://pypi.org/project/pycarlo/) compatible session. This is useful     for creating your own operator built on top of our Python SDK.    This hook expects an Airflow HTTP connection with the Monte Carlo API id as the &quot;login&quot; and the API token as the    &quot;password&quot;.    Alternatively, you could define both the Monte Carlo API id and token in &quot;extra&quot; with the following format:    ```    {        &quot;mcd_id&quot;: &quot;&lt;ID&gt;&quot;,        &quot;mcd_token&quot;: &quot;&lt;TOKEN&gt;&quot;    }    ```    See [here](https://docs.getmontecarlo.com/docs/creating-an-api-token) for details on how to generate a token.  ### Operators:- **BaseMcdOperator**  This operator can be extended to build your own operator using our [SDK](https://pypi.org/project/pycarlo/) or any other   dependencies. This is useful if you want implement your own custom logic (e.g. creating custom lineage after a task completes).- **SimpleCircuitBreakerOperator**     This operator can be used to execute a circuit breaker compatible rule (custom SQL monitor) to run integrity tests   before allowing any downstream tasks to execute. Raises an `AirflowFailException` if the rule condition is in  breach when using an Airflow version newer than 1.10.11, as that is preferred for tasks that can be failed without   retrying. Older Airflow versions raise an `AirflowException`. For instance:  ```  from datetime import datetime, timedelta    from airflow import DAG    try:    from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator  except ImportError:    # For airflow versions &lt;= 2.0.0. This module was deprecated in 2.0.0.    from airflow.operators.bash_operator import BashOperator    from airflow_mcd.operators import SimpleCircuitBreakerOperator    mcd_connection_id = 'mcd_default_session'    with DAG('sample-dag', start_date=datetime(2022, 2, 8), catchup=False, schedule_interval=timedelta(1)) as dag:      task1 = BashOperator(          task_id='example_elt_job_1',          bash_command='echo I am transforming a very important table!',      )      breaker = SimpleCircuitBreakerOperator(          task_id='example_circuit_breaker',          mcd_session_conn_id=mcd_connection_id,          rule_uuid='&lt;RULE_UUID&gt;'      )      task2 = BashOperator(          task_id='example_elt_job_2',          bash_command='echo I am building a very important dashboard from the table created in task1!',          trigger_rule='none_failed'      )        task1 &gt;&gt; breaker &gt;&gt; task2  ```  This operator expects the following parameters:    - `mcd_session_conn_id`: A SessionHook compatible connection.    - `rule_uuid`: UUID of the rule (custom SQL monitor) to execute.  The following parameters can also be passed:   - `timeout_in_minutes` [default=5]: Polling timeout in minutes. Note that The Data Collector Lambda has a max timeout of        15 minutes when executing a query. Queries that take longer to execute are not supported, so we recommend        filtering down the query output to improve performance (e.g limit WHERE clause). If you expect a query to        take the full 15 minutes we recommend padding the timeout to 20 minutes.   - `fail_open` [default=True]: Prevent any errors or timeouts when executing a rule from stopping your pipeline.        Raises `AirflowSkipException` if set to True and any issues are encountered. Recommended to set the        [trigger_rule](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/dags.html#trigger-rules)        param for any downstream tasks to `none_failed` in this case.## Tests and releasesLocally make test will run all tests. See [README-dev.md](README-dev.md) for additional details on development. When ready for a review, create a PR against main.When ready to release, create a new Github release with a tag using semantic versioning (e.g. v0.42.0) and CircleCI will test and publish to PyPI. Note that an existing version will not be deployed.## LicenseApache 2.0 - See the [LICENSE](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) for more information.</longdescription>

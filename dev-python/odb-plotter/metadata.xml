	<longdescription># ODB Plotter## Constraints:ODB Plotter is being developed by [CMML](https://www.cmml.me.msstate.edu), and as such has a focus on Additive Manufacturing and Temperature Data.## Install with pip```shellpip install odb-plotter[&quot;all&quot;]```## Install in headless mode (data processing only)```shellpip install odb-plotter```## Run the cli with python```shellpython -m odbp```## Or import to use the api```pythonfrom odbp import Odb...```## ODB Plotter Design Goals### I intend for this project to serve two purposes:- First, implement an extensible, flexible api for accessing data within .odb files or .hdf5 files with odb data- Second, implement a user-friendly, sane-defaults cli to allow for quick data extraction, manipulation, and visualization with no hassle## Changelog* Before 0.5.0: Did not have the Changelog here.* 0.5.0: API Updates and better dataframe filtering    * 0.5.1: Implement new system information (pypi tags, this changelog)    * 0.5.2: Returning support to Python 3.8+ (type hinting)    * 0.5.3: Patching conversion bugs    * 0.5.4: Parametrize number of cpus for testing* 0.6.0: Extractor improvements, ODB interface tools (iteration, receiving ODB data), re-implementation of basic 3D plots over time (including melt-pool plots). Created two-dimensional plotting capabilities    * 0.6.1: Update notices if pyvista isn't installed    * 0.6.2: Improve data extraction for plotting. Ensure that plotting doesn't fork-bomb* Upcoming:    * 0.7.0: Improve user settings, parameterization, metadata. Let users select plotting colors, keep metadata of nodesets or spatial, thermal, temporal bounds within the .hdf5.    * 0.8.0: Improve pyvista functionality: views, gifs, non-interactive image saving, leave the viewer.    * 0.9.0: Rewrite CLI to use python's cmd module and pyreadline/GNU readline.    * 1.0.0: Final bug-fixing, type checking, bounds checking, etc. Hopefully coinciding with (or following) a publication.</longdescription>

	<longdescription>[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wontonst/distributed-counter-py.svg?branch=initial)](https://travis-ci.org/wontonst/distributed-counter-py)[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/distributed-counter-py/badge/?version=latest)](http://distributed-counter-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)# Overview`distributed_counter` is a python package for maintaining counters across clusters of computers.It leverages [AWS DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb) for storage and atomicity of the counter.# Installation`distributed_counter` is compatible with `python2` and `python3`.Simply use `pip` to install.```pip install distributed_counter```You'll also want to set up your [aws configurations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html).# UsageThe interface for `distributed_counter` is very simple.Everything is done through the `DistributedCounter` class.To instantiate:```from distributed_counter import DistributedCountercounter = DistributedCounter('my_dynamo_table_name')```You can pass anything in `kwargs` to DistributedCounter and they will be propagated to the boto3 Session, e.g.```counter = DistributedCounter('mytable', region_name='us-west-1', aws_access_key_id='somekey',                             aws_secret_access_key='somesecret')```There are also special parameters `config` and `endpoint_url` which get passed to theDynamoDB ServiceResource. ## Table CreationThe dynamodb table has one HASH key called `key`. You can create the table yourself, or you can use `create_table`.```counter.create_table()````distributed_counter` is smart enough to wait for the table to finish creation on your next call to the table.## Getting/SettingNext, you can set a key using `put` and get it with `get`:```counter.put('mykey', 0)counter.get('mykey')0```## Increment/DecrementingFinally, you can `increment`/`decrement`.```counter.increment('mykey', 10)10counter.increment('mykey', 5)15counter.decrement('mykey', 14)1```Note that the returned value is the new value.You can use `increment`/`decrement` with a default.This is the same as doing a `put` then an `increment`/`decrement`.```counter.increment('nonexistantkey', 0, 0)0counter.increment('someotherkey', 0, 10)10counter.increment('yetanotherkey', 1, 10)11```## Example UseLet's say we want to run a function every 100 calls to an API.In your API, you can put:```if not counter.increment('mykey', 1) % 100:    run_function()    counter.decrement('mykey', 100)```This guarantees that no matter how many servers you have, every 100 calls to your API will run your function.The modulo is used instead of `==` because there is a corner case where hypothetically you could increment to 200 beforethe decrement finishes.</longdescription>

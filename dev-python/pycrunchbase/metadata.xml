Support all (or almost all) of CrunchBase's API functionalities2. Speedy updates when CrunchBase's API changes3. 'Pythonic' bindings, user doesn't feel like we're requesting URLsNotes on CrunchBase version 3 changes=====================================In version 3, CrunchBase changed the names of some endpoints, e.g person -&gt; people, and theyhave gone with the plural form of all entities. pycrunchbase does not adhere strictly to that.For example, there is still a `person` method, but a `people` method is also providedso that it remains backwards compatible and also supports methods that matches the nameof the entity.License=======MITChangelog=========0.3.9 (2020-12-02)* FLexible requests/six versions (#35)0.3.8 (2017-2-9)* Fix #26 encode url if it has special entities0.3.7 (2016-1-13)* Added `profile_image_url` known property to `Organization`, `Person`, and `Product` per CB-5541 bugfix from 2015-10-21* Added `featured_team` relationship for `Organization` per Crunchbase change on 2016-06-22* Added known properties `is_current` for `Job` and `is_lead_investor` for `Investment` per CB-9048 on 2016-10-14* Fixed typos in `addnode.rst`* Added David Tran to `AUTHORS.rst`0.3.6 (2015-10-21)* Alias 'PressReference' to news* Fix checking for the type of a PageItem, use lowercase compare* Update test data, those were out of sync with what CrunchBase no returns. Specifically the test data for Fund and Relationship (Organization.past_team)0.3.5 (2015-09-28)* Fixed handling null rleationships that api returns* Update setup.py release alias0.3.4 (2015-09-27)* Fixed instructions in usage.rst (#20)* Support nested relationships FundingRound -&gt; Investments -&gt; Organization* Update README0.3.3 (2015-08-29)------------------* Added `stock_exchange` as a known property of `Organization`, ref `#19 &lt;https://github.com/ngzhian/pycrunchbase/issues/19&gt;`0.3.2 (2015-07-25)------------------* New resource type StockExchange (fixes #18)* Better `__str__` for IPO0.3.1 (2015-05-25)------------------* Bug fix when relationship data returned from crunchbase is `[null]`. Thanks @karlalopez0.3.0 (2015-05-01)------------------* Updated to support version 3 of CrunchBase API* Fix endpoint urls, e.g. 'funding-round' -&gt; 'funding-rounds'* Internal cleanups, Page now subclass Relationship0.2.7 (2015-04-23)------------------* Fixed: #9 `sub_organization` and `websites` relationship of `Organization`0.2.6 (2015-04-13)------------------* Fixed: #8 printing `PageItem` leads to unbounded recursion (@dustinfarris)0.2.5 (2015-04-04)------------------* Added: Locations - get a list of active locations from CrunchBase* Added: LocationPageItem - each location in the Page of Locations* Added: Categories - get a list of active categories from CrunchBase* Added: CategoryPageItem - each location in the Page of Categories0.2.4 (2015-04-03)------------------* Added: IPO - you can now use a uuid to grab IPO data0.2.3 (2015-03-01)------------------* Fix: Travis builds and tests0.2.2 (2015-02-25)------------------* Fix: Unicode output (using UTF-8 encoding)0.2.1 (2015-02-21)------------------* Fix `__version__`0.2.0 (2015-02-15)------------------* The API is now considered relatively *stabled*. Updated the classifier to  reflect so* Change to how `CrunchBase.more` reacts to a `Relationship`, we no longer  optimize when the `Relationship` has all items, just call  `first_page_url`0.1.9 (2015-02-15)------------------* Add `series` to the `FundingRound` node.0.1.8 (2015-02-15)------------------* Update `__str__` for nodes and relationships0.1.7 (2015-02-15)------------------* `Relationship` is now a subclass of `Page`, although this strictly isn't true.  The benefit is that this allows us to reuse a lot of logic.  Relationship can be thought of as Page 0, which is a summary of potentially  multiple pages of `PageItem`. The only time we get a relationship is when we  query for a particular `Node`, e.g. organiation, and we grab the relationships  returned by the API. After this, to get more details we call `Crunchbase.more`,  and this returns us a `Page`.* Added `__repr__` methods to all the `Node`, `Relationship`, `PageItem`.  Previously we only defined `__str__`, but these didn't show up in places  like the REPL. This fixes that. We try to make it obvious what object it is  based on what is printed, but also don't want to be too verbose.0.1.6 (2015-02-15)------------------* `InvestorInvestmentPageItem` now has the possibility of being either a  `investor`, or a `invested_in` relationship* Propogates any exception when making the actual HTTP call to CrunchBase0.1.5 (2015-02-13)------------------* Add a `cb_url` attribute for all PageItem, this url is a CrunchBase page  (not the API) that holds more information for a particular PageItem  Allows you to make calls like::    company.funding_rounds[0].cb_url  to get the url of the page for the first funding round of `company`.* A new page item, InvestorInvestmentPageItem, that is useful for FundingRound info::    round = cb.funding_round('round_uuid')    an_investor = round.investments[0]  # a InvestorInvestmentPageItem    print(str(an_investor))  # prints: Investor Name $100000* Add simplified Contribution guidelines in README0.1.4 (2015-02-13)-----------------------------------------* Relationship retrieval is 0-based now, 1-based just doesn't fit well with array* Better `__str__` for `Node` and `Relationship`* `Relationship.get(i)` if `i` is too large or small will return a NonePageItem singleton0.1.3 (2015-02-12)-----------------------------------------* Fix Relationship: wasn't using the right build method of PageItem* Add test to checkk for the above* remove unused reference to CrunchBase in Relationship0.1.2 (2015-02-12)-----------------------------------------* PageItem and it's subclasses to represent an item within a relationship  of a Node* Cleanup of where utility methods live (parse_date)* More tests as always, overall 98.21% coverage0.1.0 (2015-02-21)-----------------------------------------* First release on PyPI.</longdescription>

This module will bring the whole set of raw data in a date-wise and processed format from [the COVID-19 Indian Dataset maintained by University of Kalyani](https://github.com/kalyaniuniversity/COVID-19-Datasets), which will be easier to deal with.Once installed, we can get an up-to-date information about the Covid-19 affected people, till the day the data is available at the source. We can visualize the data of our choice for any given range of dates. It is capable of giving information about the total number of confirmed, recovered and deceased patients, between any two dates, of any city, district or related to any particular gender (male/female). We can also visualize the whole up-to-date data without using any aforesaid filters using our module.# How it works?It gathers information from our own maintained database. Database data are collected from various websites, news channels and [covid19india.org crowdsourcing initiative](https://www.covid19india.org). From the collected data this module will help user to represent in user friendly format with all types of filters in one place. No need to search any website. Just use this module for India based Covid-19 projects.# Covidindia ServerThis server is mainly made to give the data related to covid-19 in India.Thsi server mainly focused on showing the data in interactive way.Link: [Covidindia Server](https://covdata.pythonanywhere.com/)## Installation     pip install covdata## What's new!!- District wise data for each state with daily basis is available now.- Number of subject tested data for every state with daily basis is now availabe.- All types of graphs can be separately generated as confirmed,deceased or recovered. No more subplots will be generated.- With all graphs data new extra data can be pushed to generate multiple line graphs to track the any relevance information.This extra data must be a dictionary or list of dictionary where for each dictionary contains a list of data points with a suitable key name.This key name will the legend name of the garph.## NoteThere might be some issues to start the server for most probably Mac users.     Files can't be made due to some error.if above line is seen in the terminal please let me know by opening an issue in [github](https://github.com/kalyaniuniversity/covidindia).If this happens server will start normally but download function will not work.## Up the server     covdata cov-server   #to start the server with default port     covdata cov-server -b :8000      #to bind the port at 8000## Usage     #import module     from covdata.covidindia import initializer,Demographic_overview,Data,visualizer     #Initialize the module to collect the data     Init=initializer()     #shows the collected data in Dataframe format of Total Confimed daily count data.(if daily is false cumulative data will be shown)     Init.show_data(of='Total Confirmed',daily=True)     obj1=Data(init)       #defining the object for Data class     cumData=obj1.get_cum_dataset_between_date('30/1/2020','5/4/2020',by='total recovered')   #gives the cumulative count between 30/1/2020 and 5/4/2020     obj1.rank(10,'Total Confirmed',kind='top',cummulative=True,date='4/3/2020')   #gives the top 10 total confirmed cases for date 4/3/2020     obj2=Demographic_overview(init)     #

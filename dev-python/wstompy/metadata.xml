	<longdescription># wstompyUsing a transport agnostic protocol and websocket-client to speak STOMP over websocket.## Features### Yes* [STOMP 1.2](https://stomp.github.io/stomp-specification-1.2.html)* Websocket with SSL/TLS(wss://) from websocket-client* Verbose socket logging thanks to websocket-client `websocket.enableTrace(True)` * Custom headers for transport and protocol### No* A non-websocket client### No, until added* STOMP versions before 1.2 * Data Classes/Models* Ready for production## Instructions### Install`pip install wstompy`### Usage```pythonimport websocketfrom wstompy.connection import WebSocketStompClientwebsocket.enableTrace(True)access_token = 'tokentokentoken'host = 'localhost'url = f'ws://{host}:8080/ws/websocket'client = WebSocketStompClient(    header_host=host,    socket_url=url,    custom_headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {access_token}'},    subprotocols=['v12.stomp'])client.run_forever(suppress_origin=True)```### Collaboration* Submit polite and/or well-written tickets for issues.* Fork and submit PRs referencing issues.* Uses poetry because they were early with pyproject.toml implementation which is neater when publishing.* Testing, feedback and reporting on usage with different server implementations.* Code is expected to have been run through black before commits, see Makefile.## Family, extended relatives and inspirations* [stomp.py](https://github.com/jasonrbriggs/stomp.py) - tried but its run loop was too sticky using dunders, preventing an easy merge with websocket-client's run loop.* [stomper](https://github.com/oisinmulvihill/stomper) - didn't have STOMP 1.2 implemented and I figured it was just as easy to reimplement to have the possibility of adding custom headers.* [stompest](https://github.com/nikipore/stompest) - didn't try it, but has async support in its packaged client. ## Developing* `flake8 wstompy/` config in .flake8 until they support pyproject.toml* `mypy wstompy/` config in pyproject.toml* `black wstompy/` config in pyproject.toml## Notes* This has initially been implemented using [Spring Framework's STOMP server](https://spring.io/guides/gs/messaging-stomp-websocket/) with and without SockJS.</longdescription>

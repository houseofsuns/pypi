	<longdescription># remindmail- turns reminders written in terminal into emails; supports scheduled reminders## features- easily manage your To Do list from anywhere in the terminal- schedule one-time or recurring reminders- schedule commands (your crontab can't run every 2 weeks as easily!)# notable dependencies- use `pip install -r requirements.md` to install all dependencies- Linux (Raspberry Pis work great!)- [cabinet](https://pypi.org/project/cabinet/)  - used to store JSON data; specifically, used to store the `remind.md` path and other important variables- a unique, non-Gmail address specifically for this project  - do not use an email address that you use in other areas of your life  - do not re-use a password you've used anywhere else; use a unique password.- Python3# setup```bash  python3 -m pip install remindmail  # adjust path accordingly  pip install -r /path/to/requirements.md  cabinet config # cabinet must be configured properly```## cabinet config- you need to install and configure [cabinet](https://github.com/tylerjwoodfin/cabinet)  - initialize using `cabinet config`; see cabinet's README for details  - in cabinet's `settings.json`, set the email information using the example below    - note that Gmail will _not_ work due to their security restrictions.    - it's very bad practice to store your password in plaintext; for this reason, never sync this file.    - always use a unique email address specifically for this, and _especially_ use a unique password.  - your settings.json file should look similar to this example:  ```  {    &quot;path&quot;: {      &quot;remindmail&quot;: {        &quot;local&quot;: &quot;/home/pi/remindmail&quot;      }    },    &quot;email&quot;: {        &quot;from&quot;: &quot;YourUniqueAndNonGmailEmailAddress&quot;,        &quot;from_pw&quot;: &quot;YourPassword&quot;,        &quot;from_name&quot;: &quot;Your Name&quot;,        &quot;to&quot;: &quot;RemindersSentToThisEmailAddress&quot;,        &quot;smtp_server&quot;: &quot;your domain's smtp server&quot;,        &quot;imap_server&quot;: &quot;your domain's imap server&quot;,        &quot;port&quot;: 465    }  }  ```## scheduling reminder checks- type &quot;crontab -e&quot; in the terminal- add the line below (without the &gt;, without the #, replacing the path with your real path):  - `0 * * * * remind generate` (every hour, generate based on remind.md)# usage- `-h` (or `--help`): Displays usage information.- `-ls` (or `-l` or `--list`): Lists all current reminders in `remind.md`.- `-g` (or `--generate`): Generates all reminders scheduled for today.   - I recommend setting up a crontab (see [generate](##generate))- `--later`: Emails reminders that are marked with `[any]`- `--show-tomorrow`: Lists reminders in remind.md that are marked with tomorrow's date in YYYY-MM-DD- `--sent-today`: Prints the number of reminders sent today (or yesterday, if before 4AM)- `--stats`: Prints usage statistics about RemindMail- `-o` (or `--offset`): Calculates the offset of a date (see [offset](##offset))- `-e` (or `--edit`): Opens `remind.md` in vim## list (-l, -ls, or --list)- lists all current reminders in `remind.md`## generate (-g or --generate)- generates reminders from `remind.md` that match the condition in brackets, such as `[wed]` matching if today is Wednesday- it is highly recommended to schedule this in crontab (Linux, MacOS) by calling `crontab -e` and adding something like```# runs every hour at 5 minutes past the hour5   * * * * python3 /path/to/site-packages/remind/remind.py -g```- reminders are generated only every 12 hours, but this can be overcome with `remind -g --force`- to test your `remind.md` without actually sending reminders, use `remind -g --dry-run`- this function requires use of SMTP; please ensure you've configured this correctly.## later (--later)- emails reminders in `remind.md` marked with `[any]`## edit (-e or --edit)- `remind edit` looks at the `path -&gt; edit -&gt; remind -&gt; value` property in cabinet's settings.json:```{    &quot;path&quot;: {      &quot;edit&quot;: {        &quot;remind&quot;: {          &quot;value&quot;: &quot;/fullpath/to/remind.md&quot;        }      }    }  }```## offset (-o or --offset)- `remind -o &lt;type&gt; &lt;date (YYYY-MM-DD, optional)&gt; &lt;n&gt;`- (`type` is day, week, month)- (`n` is 'every `n` days')- Take the results of this function and use it to add an offset.  - If you want something to happen every 3 days starting tomorrow, use:  - `remind -o day &lt;tomorrow's date YYYY-MM-DD&gt; 3`  - If the answer is 2, then you can add this to remind.md:  - [D%3+2] Description here### how this is calculated- The Epoch time is the number of seconds since January 1, 1970, UTC.- For example, if the current time is 1619394350, then today is Sunday, April 25, 2021 at 11:45:50PM UTC.- The &quot;week number&quot; is calculated by {epochTime}/60/60/24/7.  - 1619394350 /60/60/24/7 ~= 2677  - 2677 % 3 == 1, meaning scheduling a reminder for [W%3] would be sent last week, but not this week (or next week or the week after).### examples- e.g. `remind -o day 2022-12-31 12`- (find offset for every 12 days intersecting 2022-12-31)- e.g. `remind -o week 2022-12-31 3`- (every 3 weeks intersecting 2022-12-31)- e.g. `remind -o month 2022-12-31 4`- (every 4 months intersecting 2022-12-31)- e.g. `remind -o day 5`  - (every 5 days intersecting today)- e.g. `remind -o week 6`  - (every 6 weeks intersecting today)- e.g. `remind -o month 7`  - (every 7 months intersecting today)&quot;&quot;&quot;# logging- by defualt, remindmail's log path is set to `cabinet`'s default log- otherwise, you can set `path -&gt; remindmail -&gt; log` in `cabinet` (see Setup above) for a custom directory.# scheduling reminders with remind.md- this file is the heart of this tool, used for scheduling one-time or recurring reminders.- place the &quot;good&quot; example in the `remind.md example` section below in a file named `remind.md`.- reminders from the `remind.md` file will be emailed once the conditions are met.## using colons to edit email body- any text after a colon (`:`) will be placed in the body of the email.## using natural language to add to remind.md- `remind me to take out the trash` will immediately send an email upon confirmation- `remind to take out the trash tomorrow` will add `[YYYY-MM-DD]d take out the trash` upon confirmation (where `YYYY-MM-13` is the next day)  - if it is before 3AM, the reminder will immediately send an email upon confirmation- `remind write essay: need to go to library` will immediately send an email with the subject `write essay` and body `need to go to library` upon confirmation- `remind me to take out the trash tomorrow` will add `[YYYY-MM-DD]d take out the trash` upon confirmation (where `YYYY-MM-DD` is tomorrow's date)- `remind me take out the trash on Thursday` will add `[thu]d take out the trash` upon confirmation- `remind to take out the trash on the 13th` will add `[YYYY-MM-13]d take out the trash` upon confirmation (where `YYYY-MM-13` is the next `13th`)- `remind go to the gym in 4 months` will add `[YYYY-MM-DD]d take out the trash` upon confirmation (where `YYYY-MM-DD` is 4 months from today)- `remind me spring is here in 6 weeks` will add `[YYYY-MM-DD]d spring is here` upon confirmation (where `YYYY-MM-DD` is 6 weeks from today)- `remind me to finish procrastinating in 5 days` will add `[YYYY-MM-DD]d finish procrastinating` upon confirmation (where `YYYY-MM-DD` is 5 days from today)- `remind me take out the trash every 2 weeks` will add `[W%2] take out the trash` upon confirmation  - for recurring reminders, use `every n days`, `every n weeks`, or `every n months`- try other combinations, and feel free to contribute to the codebase for other scenarios!### parse without time- some queries, like `remind me to buy 12 eggs` can be misinterpreted from the date parser library, and the confirmation may ask to schedule the reminder on the 12th of the month.  - these edge cases aren't worth fixing, in the interest of preserving the ability for something like &quot;remind me on the 12th to buy eggs&quot; to continue working reliably.  - in these situations, it's worth choosing `(p)arse without time`, which ignores any potential dates and asks to send the reminder immediately## manually editing remind.md to schedule reminders### days```[D%1]         This reminder is sent every day.[D%4]         This reminder is sent every 4 days.[mon]         This reminder is sent if today is Monday.[Monday]      This reminder is sent if today is Monday.[thu]         This reminder is sent if today is Thursday.[Thursday]d   This reminder is sent, then deleted, if today is Thursday.[D01]         This reminder is sent if today is the 1st of the month.[D31]d        This reminder is sent, then deleted, if today is the 31st of the month.[D31]c        cd /foo/bar &amp;&amp;

See below...[thu%2]       This reminder is sent every other Thursday.[thu%2+1]     This reminder is sent every other Thursday (between the weeks of the line above).[W%3+1]       This reminder is sent if today is a Sunday of every third week, _with an offset of 1_, meaning if [W%3] would normally be sent last week, it will be sent this week instead.```### months```[M%5]         This reminder is sent every 5 months (_not necessarily May and October! pay attention to offsets_)[M%2]d        This reminder is sent at the next even-numbered month, then deleted.[M%2]c        cd /foo/bar &amp;&amp; rm -rf / # this reminder is a scheduled command.```### one-time or n-time reminders```[4/23]3       This reminder will be sent if today is April 23, then converted into [4/23]2[4/23]2       This reminder will be sent if today is April 23, then converted into [4/23]1 (same as [4/23]d)[4/23]1       This reminder is sent, then deleted, if today is April 23.[4/23]d       This reminder is sent, then deleted, if today is April 23.[M%3]6        This reminder will be sent, then decremented, every 3 months, until it becomes [M%3]1 in approximately 18 months.[D%2]30       This reminder will be sent, then decremented, every other day, until it becomes [D%2]1 in approximately 2 months.```### &quot;any time&quot; reminders for later```[any]         This reminder requires manual removal from remind.md[any]         You will be given a summary of [any] reminders when generateSummary() is called.[any]         This can be called as `remind later````It is recommended you add `remind later` as a scheduled crontab action.### examples that won't work```[D50]         Months only have up to 31 days.[D%3] d       The 'd' operator must be immediately next to the ] symbol.[Y%5]         Year is unsupported.(thu)         You must use brackets.{thu}         You must use brackets.   [W%3]      You must start reminders at the start of a newline.[W%3-1]       This is invalid. To add an offset, you MUST use +.[W%3+4]       An offset of 4 makes no sense and won't be triggered because [W%3+3] is the same thing as [W%3+0]. Use [W%3+1] instead.```## calculating and scheduling &quot;every n weeks&quot;, &quot;every n days&quot;, &quot;every n months&quot;- see [offset](##offset)## using &quot;d&quot; to set one-time reminders- an item with `]d`, such as `[D%5]d`, will add the reminder and remove it from remind.md, meaning it will only generate once until you add it again.  - this is useful for scheduling a reminder in the future that you don't need to repeat.</longdescription>

	<longdescription># Fast Directed Line Segment Grouping Method[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)## OverviewThis package provides an algorithm and interface to group elementary line segments in terms of direction and vicinity. The algorithm used is based on the algorithm developed by Jang &amp; Hong (2002)[^JH2002]. The software efficiently finds line segments from a bunch of elemental directed line segments placed in a three-dimensional space.## DependenciesThe library is written in _C++11_ and do not depends on any library outside of the `STL`. The Python interface is depends on `NumPy`. The library is developed on `g++` version 5.4 installed in Linux Mint 18.1 (serena). The Python interface is developed on Python 3.7.1 and Numpy 1.18.1.## References[^JH2002]: Jeong-Hun Jang &amp; Ki-Sang Hong, Pattern Recognition 35 (2002), 2235--2247 (doi: [10.1016/S0031-3203(01)00175-3](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0031-3203(01)00175-3 &quot;Jand &amp; Hong (2002)&quot;))</longdescription>

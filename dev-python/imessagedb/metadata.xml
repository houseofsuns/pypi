	<longdescription># imessagedbReads and displays the Apple iMessage database## Installation```bash$ pip install imessagedb```## Usage`imessagedb` can be used as a library for accessing and parsing the iMessasge chat databasestored at ~/Library/Messages/chat.db, or it can be used on the command line to display the contents.### How it worksThe command line version wraps the functions provided and outputs data based on the configuration available in the configuration file, as well as command line arguments.The way that iMessage identifies conversation particpants is by a `handle`, which can be theirphone number or email address. To make it easier, you can map handles in the configuration file.You can also specify the type of output (text or html) and the time frame of the messages. At this point `imesssagedb` will pull all messages from that person, regardless of the chat that itis part of. If you specify html output, `imessagedb` will copy your attachments so that they are accessibleto the web browser. In addition, it will convert certain types of attachments so that they can be viewed in the browser. For instance, it will convert HEIC files to PNG so that they browser can display it, and will convert various type of movie files to mp4 and various audiofiles to mp3. If you have many attachments, this can take a long time and take a lot of space. ### Example OutputThis is what the default html version looks like. Note that I am hovering over one of thelinks to show the image.![](JulioHtml.png)This is the same conversation rendered in text.![](JulioText.png)### Command Line```pythonimessagedb [-h] [--handle [HANDLE ...] | --name NAME] [-c CONFIGFILE]               [-o OUTPUT_DIRECTORY] [--database DATABASE] [-m ME]               [-t {text,html}] [-i] [-f | --no_copy] [--no_attachments] [-v]               [--start_time START_TIME] [--end_time END_TIME]optional arguments:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  --handle [HANDLE ...]                        A list of handles to search against  --name NAME           Person to get conversations about  -c CONFIGFILE, --configfile CONFIGFILE                        Location of the configuration file  -o OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, --output_directory OUTPUT_DIRECTORY                        The output directory where the output and attachments                        go  --database DATABASE   The database file to open  -m ME, --me ME        The name to use to refer to you  -t {text,html}, --output_type {text,html}                        The type of output  -i, --inline          Show the attachments inline  -f, --force           Force a copy of the attachments  --no_copy             Don't copy the attachments  --no_attachments      Don't process attachments at all  -v, --verbose         Turn on additional output  --start_time START_TIME                        The start time of the messages  --end_time END_TIME   The end time of the messages  --split_output SPLIT_OUTPUT                        Split the html output into files with this many messages per file  --version             Show the version number and exit  --get_handles         Display the list of handles in the database and exit  --get_chats           Display the list of chats in the database and exit```#### Command line options**-h** prints a help message                                                                        |**--handle [HANDLE ...]**  A list of handles to search against. For instance, '*--handle +12016781234 john@smith.com*'. **--name NAME** A person to search for. The mapping of person to handle is in the configuration file (see below) *** Note that you can only have one of --handle or --name, not both *****-c CONFIGFILE, --configfile CONFIGFILE** The location of the configuration file. If the file does not exist, a default configuration file will be created there. If this option is not provided, the default location is `~/.conf/iMessageDB.ini`.**-o OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, --output_directory OUTPUT_DIRECTORY** The output directory where the output and attachments go. If this option is not provided, the default location is yourhome directory. The files will be `~/NAME.html` and attachments will be in `~/NAME_Attachments`.**--database DATABASE**  The database file to open. If this option is not provided it willdefault to `~/Library/Messages/chat.db`, which is where Apple puts it.**-m ME, --me ME** The name to use to refer to you in the output. If this option is not provided it will default to `Me`.**-t {text,html}, --output_type {text,html}** The type of output, either *text* or *html*. If this option is not provided it will default to `html`.**--start_time START_TIME** &lt;br&gt;**--end_time END_TIME** By default, the program will process all messages. If you wantto restrict that to particular timeframe, you can specify the `--start-time` and/or `--end_time`options**--split_output SPLIT_OUTPUT** Split the html output into files with this many messages per file**-i, --inline**   Show the attachments inline. By default, the attachments will show as linksthat you can hover over and it will pop up the attachment. With this option, it will put theminline, which will make your output much busier and take a lot more memory in your browser.**-f, --force**  Force a copy of the attachments. By default, if the attachment already existsin the destination directory, it will not re-copy the file, but this will force it to re-copy it.**--no_copy**             Don't copy the attachments. This will make them inaccessible for viewing**--no_attachments**      Do not show the attachments at all**-v, --verbose**         Turn on additional output**--version**  Shows the version number and exits**--get_handles** Display the list of handles in the database and exit**--get_chats** Display the list of chats in the database and exit### Configuration FileThe configuration file is in configparser format. Here is the template that is createdby default:```python[CONTROL]# Whether or not to copy the attachments into a different directory. This is needed for two reasons:#  1) The web browser does not have access to the directory that the attachments are stored, so it cannot display them#  2) Some of the attachments need to be converted in order to be viewed in the browsercopy = True# The directory to put the output.

If you want to use TCP, you can pass additional parameters, for example:```shpython -m galaxyls --tcp --host=127.0.0.1 --port=2087```To check if everything went ok, you can look at the content of the server log file (`galaxy-language-server.log`) that should contain the following lines:```INFO:pygls.server:Starting server on 127.0.0.1:2087INFO:pygls.server:Shutting down the serverINFO:pygls.server:Closing the event loop.```# Galaxy Language Server Changelog## [0.10.2] - 2023-03-12### Fixed- Fix parameters and models conversion between client and server ([#224](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-language-server/pull/224)).## [0.10.1] - 2023-03-04### Fixed- Config loading issue resulting in unhandled exception with new configuration models ([#220](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-language-server/pull/220)).## [0.10.0] - 2023-02-25### Changed- Update pygls to version 1.0.1.

This should temporarily fix an issue that prevents using any custom command in the language server ([#172](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-language-server/pull/172)).## [0.6.0] - 2021-09-12### Added- Code Action language feature to be able to extract macros out of valid blocks of XML ([#165](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-language-server/pull/165)).## [0.5.3] - 2021-07-09### Fixed- An error when generating tests from inputs that contained boolean values different than `true` or `false` like `True` or `False` ([#156](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-language-server/pull/156)).## [0.5.2] - 2021-06-08### Fixed- Line offset mismatch between diagnostic line and expanded document ([#150](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-language-server/pull/150)).## [0.5.1] - 2021-06-03### Fixed- Clear diagnostics when the document is not valid ([#143](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-language-server/pull/143)).- Fix empty document validation ([#144](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-language-server/pull/144)).## [0.5.0] - 2021-05-13### Added- New feature to navigate to (or peek) `macro` and `token` definitions, open referenced macro files directly from the `&lt;import&gt;` tag and preview `token` values on hover ([#127](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-language-server/pull/127)).- A custom command to generate the expanded version of a tool document ([#128](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-language-server/pull/128)).- Existing macro names are now suggested when manually invoking IntelliSense with `Ctrl+Space` ([#132](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-language-server/pull/132)).- Support for dynamic token parameter attributes in `&lt;expand&gt;` elements ([#133](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-language-server/pull/133)).### Changed- Updated main dependencies to latests versions, specially `pygls=0.10.3` which introduced some backward incompatible changes ([#126](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-language-server/pull/126)).### Fixed- When manually invoking IntelliSense with `Ctrl+Space` in the middle of a tag or attribute the auto-completion was suggesting wrong values ([#129](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-language-server/pull/129)).- Auto-closing tags when writing `/` or `&gt;` was broken in previous versions ([#137](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-language-server/pull/137)).## [0.4.0] - 2021-02-15### Added- A custom command for tests discovery that provides information about the test definitions of all the opened tool documents in the virtual workspace ([#110](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-language-server/pull/110)).- A custom command to reorder `&lt;param&gt;` attributes according to the IUC Style Guidelines ([#104](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-language-server/pull/104)).### Fixed- Unexpected errors when generating code were failing silently without providing feedback to the user. Now an error notification will be displayed to the user ([#113](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-language-server/pull/113)).- Elements inside macros were not correctly associated with their XSD definition ([#111](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-language-server/pull/111)).- An bug in the search algorithm when analyzing the tool input trees with nested conditional sharing the same 'when' value.

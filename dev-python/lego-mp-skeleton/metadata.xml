You can find the docs hosted at &lt;https://klutzybubbles.github.io/lego-micropython-skeleton/&gt;## AboutSkeleton to help with linting programs using the MicroPython functions built for Lego EV3 MindstormsMaster branch is the branch that has been tested from python 3.4 to 3.7 based off of the functions that are listed in the documentation for lego ev3 python.Dev branch is for development to tests or updates in the ev3 python docs that need to be tested, although this package doesn't have any working code it is highly reccomended that you stick with the master branch so you dont get confused during developmentThis package contains NO WORKING CODE! all functions return### VersionsVersion spec MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.(dev)YYYYMMDDBB with BB being the build number for that day (1-1000)### InstallationBecause this project has no working code, there is no need to include it on the EV3 brick itself. Doing so will break the functionality of the project on the EV3.So to install the skeleton, on the development machine type `pip install --upgrade lego-mp-skeleton`, Generally development builds are not needed but if you would like to use them just add `--pre` to the installation command.### PyPiYou can find this project hosted on PyPi here: &lt;https://pypi.org/project/lego-mp-skeleton/&gt;## ContributingContributing is easy :D1. Fork the dev branch2. Make your changes3. Make a pull request into dev## LicenseI am in no way affiliated with Lego nor do i have any affiliation with the EV3 or EV3Dev platforms, this is a standalone package to help aid in developing Lego EV3 MicroPython programs.</longdescription>

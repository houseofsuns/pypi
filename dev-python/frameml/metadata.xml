	<longdescription># FrameMLThis is meant to be a markup language for interacting with machine learning models. This is written from the ground up with simplicity, minimalism, and power usage in mind.Core features currently include:* Variables!    * These can be from a user supplied dictionary or special variables like: `{{1}}`, previous inputs* Control flow!    * Extremely basic if statementst are provided    * Check [TODO](#TODO) for more infoIncluded in this repo is a python library for compiling this script and using it with your own programs. Here is a simple example script:```# You can write comments like this! All blank lines are ignored.&gt; Create a fictional title for the {{MOVIE_ADJECTIVE}} movie ever! This should not be a real movie; only supply me with the title.# blank lines and comments are all deleted&gt; Write a comprehensive anlaysis of {{1}}, discussing the following details: {{ANALYSIS_DETAILS}}. Make sure to sound as pedantic as possible.! if 'masterpiece' in {{2}}&gt; Someone approaches you and says {{1}} is the worst movie ever made. How do you respond?! elif 'worst' in {{2}}  # regex supported here!&gt; Some subhuman piece of garbage online actually thinks that {{1}} is the best movie made. How do you respond?! else&gt; Someone feels passionately about {{1}}. They are frustrated with your apathy. What do you respond with?! endif```The script could be called like so:* `FrameML` is our class that wraps this functionality* `model_call` is a `Callable` that takes a string and returns a string from your model* `FrameML.compile()` takes a `**kwargs`, named parameters# TODO:* [ ] Implement other cooler control flow    * Again, may or may not be necessary but it might be cool* [ ] Allow user to implement their own functions in the script    * This may be out of the scope for the project</longdescription>

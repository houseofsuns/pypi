It allowsusers to programmatically retrieve schedules for waste removal in their area, includingtrash, recycling, compost, and more.Special thanks to @stealthhacker for the inspiration!# Installation```bashpip install aiorecollect```# Python Versions`aiorecollect` is currently supported on:- Python 3.9- Python 3.10- Python 3.11# Place and Service IDsTo use `aiorecollect`, you must know both your ReCollect Place and Service IDs.In general, cities/municipalities that utilize ReCollect will give you a way tosubscribe to a calendar with pickup dates. If you examine the iCal URL for thiscalendar, the Place and Service IDs are embedded in it:```webcal://recollect.a.ssl.fastly.net/api/places/PLACE_ID/services/SERVICE_ID/events.en-US.ics```# Usage```pythonimport asynciofrom datetime import datefrom aiorecollect import Clientasync def main() -&gt; None:    &quot;&quot;&quot;Run.&quot;&quot;&quot;    client = await Client(&quot;&lt;PLACE ID&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;SERVICE ID&gt;&quot;)    # The client has a few attributes that you can access:    client.place_id    client.service_id    # Get all pickup events on the calendar:    pickup_events = await client.async_get_pickup_events()    # ...or get all pickup events within a certain date range:    pickup_events = await client.async_get_pickup_events(        start_date=date(2020, 10, 1), end_date=date(2020, 10, 31)    )    # ...or just get the next pickup event:    next_pickup = await client.async_get_next_pickup_event()asyncio.run(main())```## The `PickupEvent` ObjectThe `PickupEvent` object that is returned from the above calls comes with threeproperties:- `date`: a `datetime.date` that denotes the pickup date- `pickup_types`: a list of `PickupType` objects that will occur with this event- `area_name`: the name of the area in which the event is occurring## The `PickupType` ObjectThe `PickupType` object contains the &quot;internal&quot; name of the pickup type _and_ ahuman-friendly representation when it exists:- `name`: the internal name of the pickup type- `friendly_name`: the humany-friendly name of the pickup type (if it exists)## Connection PoolingBy default, the library creates a new connection to ReCollect with each coroutine. Ifyou are calling a large number of coroutines (or merely want to squeeze out every secondof runtime savings possible), an [`aiohttp`][aiohttp] `ClientSession` can be used forconnection pooling:```pythonimport asynciofrom aiohttp import ClientSessionfrom aiorecollect import Clientasync def main() -&gt; None:    &quot;&quot;&quot;Run.&quot;&quot;&quot;    async with ClientSession() as session:        client = await Client(&quot;&lt;PLACE ID&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;SERVICE ID&gt;&quot;, session=session)        # Get to work...asyncio.run(main())```# ContributingThanks to all of [our contributors][contributors] so far!1.

	<longdescription>HCLI Core |pypi|_ |build status|_ |pyver|_ |huckle|_ |hc|_==========================================================An HCLI Connector that can be used to expose a REST API with a built-in CLI, via hypertextcommand line interface (HCLI) semantics.----HCLI Core implements an HCLI Connector, a type of Service Connector, as a WSGI application and provides a wayfor developers to expose a service hosted CLI, as a REST API, via HCLI semantics. Such an API exposes a &quot;built-in&quot;CLI that can be interacted with dynamically with any HCLI client. Up to date, in-band, man page style API/CLIdocumentation is readily available for use to help understand how to interact with the API.Most, if not all, programming languages have a way to issue shell commands. With the helpof a generic HCLI client, such as Huckle [1], APIs that make use of HCLI semantics are readily consumableanywhere via the familiar command line (CLI) mode of operation, and this, without there being a need to writea custom and dedicated CLI to interact with a specific HCLI API.You can find out more about HCLI on hcli.io [2]The HCLI Internet-Draft [3] is a work in progress by the author and the current implementation leverages hal+json alongside a static form of ALPS(semantic profile) [4] to help enable widespread cross media-type support.Help shape HCLI and it's ecosystem by raising issues on github![1] https://github.com/cometaj2/huckle[2] http://hcli.io[3] https://github.com/cometaj2/I-D/tree/master/hcli[4] http://alps.ioRelated HCLI Projects---------------------- hcli-hc, a pypi package that wraps an HCLI sample application (hc); hc can can act both as a gcode streamer (e.g. for OpenBuilds Blackbox controller v1.1g) and CNC interface. In other words, this HCLI acts in the same capacity as the OpenBuilds CONTROL software and OpenBuilds Interface CNC Touch hardware to help control a GRBL v1.1g controlled CNC. [5][5] https://github.com/cometaj2/hcli_hcInstallation------------hcli_core requires a supported version of Python and pip.You'll need an WSGI compliant application server to run hcli_core. For example, you can use Green Unicorn (https://gunicorn.org/), and anHCLI client such as Huckle (https://github.com/cometaj2/huckle). The following runs the default *jsonf* HCLI bundled with HCLI Core... code-block:: console    pip install hcli-core    pip install gunicorn    pip install huckle    gunicorn --workers=5 --threads=2 -b 127.0.0.1:8000 --chdir `hcli_core path` &quot;hcli_core:connector()&quot;Usage-----Open a different shell window.Setup the huckle env eval in your .bash_profile (or other bash configuration) to avoid having to execute eval everytime you want to invoke HCLIs by name (e.g. jsonf).Note that no CLI is actually installed by Huckle. Huckle reads the HCLI semantics exposed by the API and ends up behaving *like* the CLI it targets... code-block:: console    huckle cli install http://127.0.0.1:8000    eval $(huckle env)    jsonf help3rd Party HCLI Installation---------------------------If you want to load a sample HCLI other than the default sample application, you can try loading one of the other sample HCLIsincluded with HCLI Core. For example, the *hg* HCLI (hypertext GPT-3.5-Turbo chatbot).A folder path to any other 3rd party HCLI can be provided in the same way to the HCLI Connector, provided the 3rd party HCLI meetsCLI interface (cli.py) and HCLI template (template.json) requirements:.. code-block:: console    pip install hcli-core    pip install gunicorn    pip install huckle    gunicorn --workers=5 --threads=2 --chdir `hcli_core path` &quot;hcli_core:connector(\&quot;`hcli_core sample hg`\&quot;)&quot;3rd Party HCLI Usage--------------------Open a different shell window.Setup the huckle env eval in your .bash_profile (or other bash configuration) to avoid having to execute eval everytime you want to invoke HCLIs by name (e.g. hg)... code-block:: console        huckle cli install http://127.0.0.1:8000    eval $(huckle env)    hg helpVersioning----------    This project makes use of semantic versioning (http://semver.org) and may make use of the &quot;devx&quot;,&quot;prealphax&quot;, &quot;alphax&quot; &quot;betax&quot;, and &quot;rcx&quot; extensions where x is a number (e.g. 0.3.0-prealpha1)on github. Only full major.minor.patch releases will be pushed to pip from now on.Supports--------- HTTP/HTTPS.- HCLI version 1.0 server semantics for hal+json- Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) through PEP 3333 and Falcon.- Bundled Sample HCLIs:    - jsonf - a simple formatter for JSON.    - hg    - an HCLI for interacting with GPT-3.5-Turbo via terminal input and output streams.    - hfm   - a file upload and download manager that works with \*nix terminal shell input and output streams.    - hptt  - a rudimentary HCLI Push To Talk (PTT) channel management service.    - hub   - a rudimentary HCLI service discovery hub.    - nw    - a flexible IP Address Management (IPAM) service.- Support for use of any 3rd party HCLI code that meets CLI interface requirements and HCLI template requirements (i.e. see sample HCLIs).- Support large input and output streams as application/octet-stream.To Do------ Automated tests for all bundled HCLI samples.- A memory layer for the GPT-3.5-Turbo HCLI (hg).    - Automatic context switching per NLP on received input stream.    - Context blending to mary different contexts.    - Automatic context compression to yield a more substantial memory footprint per context window.- A shell mode for the GPT-3.5-Turbo HCLI (hg) to enable shell CLI execution per sought goal.- Separate out HCLI applications from HCLI Core to help avoid application dependencies bleeding onto HCLI Core (e.g. OpenAI, GRBL, pyserial, etc.).- Update GRBL controller HCLI (hc) to include support for additional commands and/or echo of hexadecimal values.- Update hc to include job removal and insertion.- Update hc to function in a multi-process environment (e.g. multiple workers in gunicorn).- Implement GRBL emulation tests for hc.Bugs----- No good handling of control over request and response in cli code which can lead to exceptions and empty response client side.- The hfm sample HCLI fails disgracefully when copying a remote file name that doesn't exist (server error)... |build status| image:: https://circleci.com/gh/cometaj2/hcli_core.svg?style=shield.. _build status: https://circleci.com/gh/cometaj2/hcli_core.. |pypi| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/hcli-core?label=hcli-core.. _pypi: https://pypi.org/project/hcli-core.. |pyver| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/hcli-core.svg.. _pyver: https://pypi.org/project/hcli-core.. |huckle| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/huckle?label=huckle.. _huckle: https://pypi.org/project/huckle.. |hc| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/hcli-hc?label=hcli-hc.. _hc: https://pypi.org/project/hcli-hc</longdescription>

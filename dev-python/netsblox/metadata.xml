	<longdescription># PyBloxNetsBlox is a block-based programming environment which has a focus on distributed computing and internet connectivity.One of the core features of NetsBlox are _remote procedure calls_ (RPCs), which connect to the NetsBlox server and provide access to online resources such as databases, GoogleMaps, online translation, wireless robotics, mobile phone sensors/control, and more.PyBlox is an interface for accessing all [NetsBlox](https://netsblox.org/) services from within python.You can import this package in any python program that has internet access and begin calling RPCs and sending/receiving messages!For more information about NetsBlox and the available services, see the official [NetsBlox Documentation](https://editor.netsblox.org/docs/index.html).# Example UsageHere's a short example to see how you can access the [`MaunaLoaCO2Data`](https://editor.netsblox.org/docs/services/MaunaLoaCO2Data/index.html) service from python.```pyimport netsbloxnb = netsblox.Client() # create a client to access NetsBloxdata = nb.mauna_loa_co2_data.get_co2_trend(2000, 2010)print(data)```# Graphical EnvironmentPyBlox, while useful on its own for accessing NetsBlox services, has a side goal of helping transition students from block-based languages like NetsBlox and Snap! into textual languages like python.Because of this, PyBlox comes with a power graphical environment that supports most of the same features as NetsBlox/Snap!, as well as an IDE for creating python projects in a way that is still structured like a NetsBlox/Snap! project in both appearnance and concurrency model (closest approximation).These features are only activated when explicitly called, leaving the default behavior as a normal python package for accessing NetsBlox services.To launch the IDE, you can simply run PyBlox (`netsblox`) as a module:```shpython -m netsblox```# InstallationPyBlox is available as a pip package called `netsblox` (keep in mind that PyBlox is a python3 package, so you may need to use `pip3` if your `pip` still points to the python2 version).```shpip install netsblox```If you run into installation issues with the `nb2pb` dependency, follow the instruction [here](https://github.com/dragazo/nb2pb).It is possible that there is not a wheel build for your platform and/or python version, which means that it must be compiled from source.This requires installing [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html), after which you can reattempt installing `netsblox`.If this solves your problem, feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/dragazo/PyBlox/issues/new) including your operating system and processor architecture.The following additional setup is required, depending on your operating system.## Windows_No additional install dependencies_## Mac```shbrew install python-tk```## Linux```shsudo apt install python3-pil python3-pil.imagetksudo apt install idle3```# Structured DataDue to the limited type primitives in Snap!, one NetsBlox typing convention is &quot;structured data&quot;, which is really just a list of lists (pairs) denoting (unique string) keys and values.In the python interface, this is replaced by `dict` for both input and return value.The python interface will automatically convert input `dict` values into lists of lists, and convert lists of lists return values into `dict` (where appropriate).Note that this conversion is only performed by the static service wrappers like `Client.chart.default_options()`, and not for the dynamic invocation method: `Client.call('Chart', 'defaultOptions')`.# Naming ConventionsThe python names for services, functions, and input parameters are identical to those in the official [NetsBlox documentation](https://editor.netsblox.org/docs/index.html), except that they are converted into snake case to by more pythonic.Of course, any modern editor will have some form of intellisense built in, so in practice this is a non-issue.</longdescription>

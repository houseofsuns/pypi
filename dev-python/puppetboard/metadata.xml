This is because in suchcases with this setting Puppet will just use a cached working catalog and report the run to PuppetDB as successful.(Although with an error visible in the Puppet run log.)Therefore, to show the nodes with a catalog compilation as failed in Puppetboard you need to set`usecacheonfailure = false` in your nodes' `puppet.conf`.### PuppetDBOf course you need to configure your Puppet Server to store the Puppet run reports in PuppetDB.If you haven't done that already please follow the [PuppetDB documentation](https://puppet.com/docs/puppetdb/latest/connect_puppet_server.html)about this.If you run Puppetboard on a different host than PuppetDB then you may want to configure the certificateallow-list for which certificates are allowed to access data from PuppetDB.Please read more about this feature in the [PuppetDB documentation here](https://puppet.com/docs/puppetdb/latest/configure.html#certificate-allowlist).### App settingsPuppetboard will look for a file pointed at by the `PUPPETBOARD_SETTINGS` environment variable.The file has to be identical to[default_settings.py](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/blob/master/puppetboard/default_settings.py)but should only override the settings you need changed.If you run PuppetDB and Puppetboard on the same machine the default settings provided will be enough to get you startedand you won't need a custom settings file.Assuming your webserver and PuppetDB machine are not identical you will at least have to change the following settings:-   `PUPPETDB_HOST`-   `PUPPETDB_PORT`By default PuppetDB requires SSL to be used when a non-local client wants to connect. Therefore you'll also have tosupply the following settings:-   `PUPPETDB_SSL_VERIFY = /path/to/ca/keyfile.pem`-   `PUPPETDB_KEY = /path/to/private/keyfile.pem`-   `PUPPETDB_CERT = /path/to/public/keyfile.crt`When using the Puppetboard Docker image, you may also pass Puppetboard it's certificate contents via these environmentvariables, either as a multiline string or pre-base64 encoded. This can be useful where the certificate is stored in asecrets store i.e. AWS SSM Parameter Store.```PUPPETDB_CERT=&quot;-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----...-----END CERTIFICATE-----&quot;``````PUPPETDB_CERT=LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBSU0EgUFJJVkFURSBLRVktLS0tLQouLi4KLS0tLS1FTkQgQ0VSVElGSUNBVEUtLS0tLQ==```For information about how to generate the correct keys please refer to the[pypuppetdb documentation](https://pypuppetdb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/connecting.html#ssl). Alternatively it is possibleto explicitly specify the protocol to be used setting the `PUPPETDB_PROTO` variable.Other settings that might be interesting, in no particular order:- `SECRET_KEY`: set this to a long string, **the same for each application replica** and keep it secret. Refer to    [Flask documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/quickstart/#sessions), section    &quot;How to generate good secret keys&quot; for more info.- `FAVORITE_ENVS`: an ordered list of Puppet environment names that will be shown immediately after &quot;All Environments&quot;    and before other environments (which are sorted by name) in the dropdown for choosing the environment shown    in the top-right of the UI. Environments listed here that do not really exist in your deployment are silently ignored.- `SHOW_ERROR_AS`: `friendly` or `raw`. The former makes Puppet run errors in Report and Failures views shown    in a modified, (arguably) more user-friendly form. The latter shows them as they are.    Defaults to `friendly`.- `CODE_PREFIX_TO_REMOVE`: what code path that should be shortened in &quot;Friendly errors&quot; to &quot;…&quot; for readability.    A regexp. Defaults to `/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments(/.*?/modules)?`.- `PUPPETDB_TIMEOUT`: Defaults to 20 seconds, but you might need to increase this value. It depends on how big the    results are when querying PuppetDB. This behaviour will change in a future release when pagination will be introduced.- `UNRESPONSIVE_HOURS`: The amount of hours since the last check-in after which a node is considered unresponsive.- `LOGLEVEL`: A string representing the loglevel. It defaults to `'info'` but can be changed to `'warning'` or    `'critical'` for less verbose logging or `'debug'` for more information.- `ENABLE_QUERY`: Defaults to `True` causing a Query tab to show up in the web interface allowing users to write    and execute arbitrary queries against a set of endpoints in PuppetDB. Change this to `False` to disable this.    See `ENABLED_QUERY_ENDPOINTS` to fine-tune which endpoints are allowed.- `ENABLED_QUERY_ENDPOINTS`: If `ENABLE_QUERY` is `True`, allow to fine tune the endpoints of PuppetDB APIs that    can be queried. It must be a list of strings of PuppetDB endpoints for which the query is enabled.    See the `QUERY_ENDPOINTS` constant in the `puppetboard.app` module for a list of the available endpoints.- `GRAPH_TYPE`: Specify the type of graph to display.   Default is    pie, other good option is donut.   Other choices can be found here:    \_C3JS\_documentation\`- `GRAPH_FACTS`: A list of fact names to tell PuppetBoard to generate a pie-chart on the fact page. With some fact    values being unique per node, like ipaddress, uuid, and serial number, as well as structured facts it was no longer    feasible to generate a graph for everything.- `INVENTORY_FACTS`: A list of tuples that serve as the column header and the fact name to search for to create    the inventory page. If a fact is not found for a node then `undef` is printed.- `INVENTORY_FACT_TEMPLATES`: A mapping between fact name and jinja template to customize display- `ENABLE_CATALOG`: If set to `True` allows the user to view a node's latest catalog. This includes all managed    resources, their file-system locations and their relationships, if available. Defaults to `False`.- `REFRESH_RATE`: Defaults to `30` the number of seconds to wait until the index page is automatically refreshed.- `DEFAULT_ENVIRONMENT`: Defaults to `'production'`, as the name suggests, load all information filtered by this    environment value.- `REPORTS_COUNT`: Defaults to `10` the limit of the number of reports to load on the node or any reports page.- `OFFLINE_MODE`: If set to `True` load static assets (jquery, semantic-ui, etc) from the local web server instead    of a CDN. Defaults to `False`.- `DAILY_REPORTS_CHART_ENABLED`: Enable the use of daily chart graphs when looking at dashboard and node view.- `DAILY_REPORTS_CHART_DAYS`: Number of days to show history for on the daily report graphs.- `DISPLAYED_METRICS`: Metrics to show when displaying node summary. Example: `'resources.total'`, `'events.noop'`.- `TABLE_COUNT_SELECTOR`: Configure the dropdown to limit number of hosts to show per page.- `LITTLE_TABLE_COUNT`: Default number of reports to show when when looking at a node.- `NORMAL_TABLE_COUNT`: Default number of nodes to show when displaying reports and catalog nodes.- `LOCALISE_TIMESTAMP`: If set to `True` then timestamps are shown using your browser's timezone. Otherwise UTC is used. Defaults to `True`.- `WITH_EVENT_NUMBERS`: If set to `True` then Overview and Nodes list shows exact number of changed resources    in the last report. Otherwise shows only 'some' string if there are resources with given status. Setting this    to `False` gives performance benefits, especially in big Puppet environments (more than few hundreds of nodes).    Defaults to `True`.- `ENABLE_CLASS`: If set to `True` allows the user to view the number of resource events (number of changed resources in the last report) grouped by class.    The resource events are grouped by their status ('failure', 'success', 'noop'). - `CLASS_EVENTS_STATUS_COLUMNS`: A mapping between the status of the resource events and the name of the columns of the table to display.- `CACHE_TYPE`: Specifies which type of caching object to use when `SCHEDULER_ENABLED` is set to `True`.    The cache is used for the classes view (`ENABLE_CLASS` is set to `True`) which requires parsing the events of all the latest reports to group them by Puppet class.    If the last report is present in the cache, we do not parse the events, which avoids unnecessary processing.    If you configure more than one worker, you must use a shared backend (e.g. `MemcachedCache`) to allow the sharing of the cache between the processes.    Indeed, the `SimpleCache` type does not allow sharing the cache between processes, it uses the process memory to store the cache.    Defaults to `SimpleCache`.- `CACHE_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`: Cache lifetime in second. Defaults to `3600`.- `SCHEDULER_ENABLED`: If set to `True` then a scheduler instance is created in order to execute scheduled jobs. Defaults to `False`.- `SCHEDULER_JOBS`: List of the scheduled jobs to trigger within a worker.    A job can for example be used to compute a result to be cached. This is the case for the classes view which uses a job to pre-compute at regular intervals the results to be displayed.     Each scheduled job must contain the following fields: `id`, `func`, `trigger`, `seconds`.- `SCHEDULER_LOCK_BIND_PORT`: Specifies an available port that allows a single worker to listen on it.    This allows to configure scheduled jobs in a single worker. Defaults to `49100`.## Getting Help&lt;a id=&quot;getting-help&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;For questions or bug reports you can file an [issue](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues).## Contributing&lt;a id=&quot;contributing&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;### DevelopmentPuppetboard relies on the [pypuppetdb](https://pypi.org/project/pypuppetdb/) library to fetch data from PuppetDBand is built with the help of the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) microframework.If you wish to hack on Puppetboard you should fork/clone the Github repository and then install the requirements through:```bashpip install --upgrade wheel setuptoolspython setup.py developpip install --upgrade -r requirements-test.txtmypy --install-types --non-interactive puppetboard/ test/```You're advised to do this inside a virtualenv specifically created to work on Puppetboard as to not pollute your global Python installation.You can run the tests with:```bashpytest --cov=. --cov-report=xml --strict-markers --mypy puppetboard testpylint --errors-only puppetboard test```You can run the app it in development mode by simply executing:```bashflask run```You can specify listening host and port with environment variables or command line otions:```bashexport FLASK_RUN_HOST=0.0.0.0export FLASK_RUN_PORT=8000flask run```or```bashflask run --host '0.0.0.0' --port '8000'```Use `PUPPETBOARD_SETTINGS` to change the different settings or patch `default_settings.py` directly.Take care not to include your local changes on that file when submitting patches for Puppetboard.Place a `settings.py` file inside the base directory of the git repository that will be used, if the environmentvariable is not set.We welcome contributions to this project.

This change now supports the changes in PuppetDB &gt;= 6.9.1 (https://puppet.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-7943/)* Added backwards compatability support for both the metric `v1` and `v2` endpoints  depending on the version of the server. Any PuppetDB &gt;= `6.9.1` will be queried with  the `v2` endpoint automatically (because `v1` is disabled from here forward). Any  PuppetDB &lt;= `6.9.0` will use `v1`.* pypuppetdb: raise version requirement `&gt;=2.1.0` because changes were needed in this library to support the metrics v2 fixes.* app.py: Added python2 backwards compatability fix for importing `urllib`.2.0.0----* Dockerfile: Switch to python:3.7-alpine image* pypuppetdb: raise version requirement `&gt;=1.2.0` to `&gt;=2.0.0`* Drop support for python2.7 and python3.5 &amp; Add python3.8 to buildmatrix* Upgrade of tests requirements + resolving current deprecation warnings* Ignore facts environment for compatibility and performance* Adding mypy + Cleanup + CommonMark upgrade to 0.9.1* Update docker and fix coveralls not running.* Cast inventory data toString1.1.0-----* Move to Python 3.6 for Docker* Fix problem loading daily chart on node page* fix gunicorn parameter and allow to define workers in docker* Add feature for better performance in big Puppet envs* bundle requirements.txt for tests and docker1.0.0-----* CI enhancements* Allow to configure which PuppetDB endpoints are allowed* Update c3 to 4.22* Add basic health check endpoint* Allow to force the PuppetDB connection protocol* Update jquery-tablesort to 0.0.11* Fix bug breaking date/time sort* Fix formatvalue for list of dicts* Modify date sort to handle failed* Include template files for altering Semantic css and Google fonts* Make 320px the max width for columns* If query is None don't perform add on it* Query using producer\_timestamp index vs. start\_time* Add missing components for building source packages* Add support for URL prefixes to Docker image0.3.0-----* Core UI Rework* Update to pypuppetdb 0.3.3* Fix sorty on data for index* Update debian documentation* Offline mode fix* Fix fact attribute error on paths* Enhanced testing* Radiator CSS uses same coloring* Markdown in config version* Update Flask* Cleanup requirements.txt* Update package maintainer for OpenBSD0.2.1-----* Daily Charts* Fixed missing javascript files on radiator view.* TravisCI and Coveralls integration.* Fixed app crash in catalog view.* Upgrade pypuppetdb to 0.3.2* Enhanced queries for Node and Report (\#271)* Optimize Inventory Code.* Use certname instead of hostname to identify nodes when applicable.* Add environment filter for facts.* Update cs.js to 0.4.11* Fix radiator column alignment* Security checks with bandit* Dockerfile now uses gunicorn and environment variables for configuration.* Handle division by zero errors.* Implement new Jquery Datatables.* JSON output for radiator. \* Move javascript to head tag.* Optimize reports and node page queries.* Fix all environments for PuppetDB 3.2* Fact graph chart now configurable.* Support for Flask 0.12 and Jinja2 2.9* Fix misreporting noops as changes.0.2.0-----* Full support for PuppetDB 4.x* Updating Semantic UI to 2.1.8* Updating Flask-WTF requirements to 0.12* Updating WTForms to 2.x* Restored CSRF protection on the Query Tab form* Updating Pypuppetdb requirement to 0.3.x* New configuration option OVERVIEW\_FILTER allows users to add custom PuppetDB query clauses to include/exclude nodes displayed on the index page* Adding Radiator view similar to what is available in Puppet Dashboard* Adding a drop-down list in the Reports tab to configure the number of reports displayed* Removing unneeded report\_latest() endpoint.

This is useful in environments without internet access.0.0.4-----* Fix the sorting of the different tables containing facts.* Fix the license in our `setup.py`. The license shouldn't be longer than 200 characters. We were including the full license tripping up tools like bdist\_rpm.0.0.3-----This release introduces a few big changes. The most obvious one is the revampedOverview page which has received significant love. Most of the work was done byJulius Härtl. The Nodes tab has been given a slight face-lift too.Other changes:* This release depends on the new pypuppetdb 0.1.0. Because of this the SSL configuration options have been changed:  * `PUPPETDB_SSL` is gone and replaced by `PUPPETDB_SSL_VERIFY` which now defaults to `True`. This only affects connections to PuppetDB that happen over SSL.  * SSL is automatically enabled if both `PUPPETDB_CERT` and `PUPPETDB_KEY` are provided.* Display of deeply nested metrics and query results have been fixed.* Average resources per node metric is now displayed as a natural number.* A link back to the node has been added to the reports.* A few issues with reports have been fixed.* A new setting called `UNRESPONSIVE_HOURS` has been added which denotes the amount of hours after which Puppetboard will display the node as unreported if it hasn't checked in. We default to `2` hours.* The event message can now be viewed by clicking on the event.Puppetboard is now neatly packaged up and available on PyPI. This shouldsignificantly help reduce the convoluted installation instructions people hadto follow.Updated installation instructions have been added on how to install from PyPIand how to configure your HTTPD.0.0.2-----In this release we've introduced a few new things. First of all we now require pypuppetdb version 0.0.4 or later which includes support for the v3 API introduced with PuppetDB 1.5.Because of changes in PuppetDB 1.5 and therefor in pypuppetdb users of the v2 API, regardless of the PuppetDB version, will no longer be able to view reports or events.In light of this the following settings have been removed:* `PUPPETDB_EXPERIMENTAL`Two new settings have been added:* `PUPPETDB_API`: an integer, defaulting to `3`, representing the API version we want to use.* `ENABLE_QUERY`: a boolean, defaulting to `True`, on wether or not to be able to use the Query tab.We've also added a few new features:* Thanks to some work done during PuppetConf together with Nick Lewis (from Puppet Labs) we now expose all of PuppetDB's metrics in the Metrics tab. The formatting isn't exactly pretty but it's a start.* Spencer Krum added the graphing capabilities to the Facts tab.* Daniel Lawrence added a feature so that facts on the node view are clickable and take you to the complete overview of that fact for your infrastructure and made the nodes in the complete facts list clickable so you can jump to a node.* Klavs Klavsen contributed some documentation on how to run Puppetboard with Passenger.0.0.1-----Initial release.</longdescription>

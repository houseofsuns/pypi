	<longdescription>![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)# Escriptorium ConnectorThis simple python package makes it easy to connect to [eScriptorium](https://gitlab.com/scripta/escriptorium) and work with the data stored there.## InstallationAnd the obligatory: `pip install escriptorium-connector`## UsageIf you are working on a public repository, you will probably want to store your user credentials in a hidden `.env` file that does not get distributed with your code. This is pretty easy to accomplish with [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/). You will need to provide the connector with an eScriptorium instance URL, the API your username, and your password (see below).The `EscriptoriumConnector` class provides (or will provide) all the methods needed to interact programmatically with the eScriptorium platform.Example usage:```pythonfrom escriptorium_connector import EscriptoriumConnectorimport osfrom dotenv import load_dotenvif __name__ == '__main__':    load_dotenv()    url = str(os.getenv('ESCRIPTORIUM_URL'))    username = str(os.getenv('ESCRIPTORIUM_USERNAME'))    password = str(os.getenv('ESCRIPTORIUM_PASSWORD'))    escr = EscriptoriumConnector(url, username, password)    print(escr.get_documents())```And your `.env` file should have:```txtESCRIPTORIUM_URL=https://www.escriptorium.frESCRIPTORIUM_USERNAME=your_escriptorium_usernameESCRIPTORIUM_PASSWORD=your_escriptorium_password```See [this Jupyter notebook](https://gitlab.com/sofer_mahir/escriptorium_python_connector/-/blob/main/example.ipynb) for a longer introduction to the connector.# DevelopmentWant to contribute? There is a lot to be done here, so we are happy for any PRs and updates.## Development EnvironmentThis project uses Poetry. To start development, please pull down the repo from GitLab and run `poetry install`, which will make sure you have all the needed dependencies for the project and that you are using a valid Python version. Please use `poetry add &lt;your-pip-package&gt;` to install any new dependencies to the project so that they will be tracked by poetry.### Package StructureThe escriptorium_connector package aims to provide a more or less fool-proof interface to the eScriptorium REST API. The main goal has bee to take the guess work out of what should be sent to the API in POST/PUT requests and to make very clear what one should expect to get back from a GET request. It also aims to ease introduction to the API by providing hard-coded access to all the endpoints the API provides, which might not be immediately accessible by other means.Part of the user convenience this package provides is a set of data transfer objects (DTOs) mentioned above, which take the guesswork out of API POST/PUT requests. These are available in the `src/escriptorium_connector/dtos` folder, make use of [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io) for (de)serialization, and should all be exposed only from the `dtos` package module `src/escriptorium_connector/dtos/__init__.py` not the root level. A tentative, automated dump of the latest eScriptorium DTOs from the Django DRF is found in the file `./src/escriptorium_connector/dtos/escriptorium_schema.py`, sometimes the info there is helpful, other times it is not.The connector itself, `src/escriptorium_connector/connector.py`,provides high level functionality on top of some lower level actions. The class it provides, `EscriptoriumConnector`, takes care of acquiring the needed JWTs and cookies from an eScriptorium web server and needs only to be provided with the server URL, a username, and a password. The `EscriptoriumConnector` creates a special requests `http` instance that takes care of retries on 500 errors and some other niceties for error reporting (see the error classes in `src/escriptorium_connector/connector_errors.py`). It maintains its own HTTP session and uses websockets to listen for the completion of requests that return immediately from the server, but then notify the user later via websocket/email that the requested action has completed.Any bespoke utility type functions should be placed in the `src/escriptorium_connector/utils` folder. No functionality there should be exposed at the project root.High level functions using the API such as the `copy_documents*` functions, which provide a convenience layer over multiple discrete API transactions, should be placed in the `src/escriptorium_connector/convenience_functions` but should nevertheless be reexported at the root level of the package for easy user access.As a final goal, all functionality exposed by the `EscriptoriumConnector` will have clearly typed arguments and return types. All endpoints should be tested at least to some degree (see the `tests` folder) and code coverage can be checked when running `poetry run pytest` with the proper settings in `setup.cfg` (see the notes at the end of that file). The current code coverage can be viewed in the `htmlconv` folder. The escriptorium_connector package should be versioned in line with the [eScriptorium](https://gitlab.com/scripta/escriptorium) project, since different versions of eScriptorium will change their API surface and we cannot expect all production servers to be running the same version. Currently the latest version of the eScriptorium server is at version 0.10.2a, so the corresponding connector version should match at 0.10.2a, and any bugfixes to that version should be numbered as 0.10.2a.post1, 0.10.2a.post2, ..., 0.10.2a.postN. This will enable users to quickly verify they are using a connector that is compatible with the server they are accessing. __Note that the package has not yet reached full API coverage for any eScriptorium version, and thus it remains on a non-related version system.__### TestsIt would be nice to get as much test covereage as possible in order to detect breaking changes in the eScriptorium API. Tests are found in the `./tests` folder and can be run with `poetry run pytest --cov-config=.coveragerc`, which will generate a nice code coverage report in HTML in the `./htmlcov` folder. Since we will probably support several version of eScriptorium you will need to make sure that the line `registry.gitlab.com/scripta/escriptorium:latest` in `escriptorium_docker/docker-compose.yml` points to the correct escriptorium image (in place of `:latest`).## Uploading to PypiPoetry makes uploading to Pypi very easy. Just confirm that all the package details in `pyproject.toml` are correct, bump the version of the package `poetry version 0.0.15`, and then use `poetry publish --build --username $PYPI_USERNAME --password $PYPI_PASSWORD`, assuming you have set the environment variables `$PYPI_USERNAME` and `$PYPI_PASSWORD` appropriately (if you are using a Pypi token, then `PYPI_USERNAME=__token__` and `$PYPI_PASSWORD=&lt;your-full-pypi-token&gt;`).You should create a new git tag and push it after you publish:    git tag v0.0.15    git push --tags## DockerThis repo contains a working docker-compose setup in `escriptorium_docker` (go there and run `docker-compose up -d`). The account settings there (see `escriptorium_docker/variables.env`) match those in `.env`. This docker-compose application must be running for the escriptorium tests to run and is generally useful for safe testing of the connector without damaging a production instance of eScriptorium.The escriptorium-pgp-setup repository contains WSL oriented instructions on running a local copy of e-scriptorium.## Version History* 0.2.6 - Update DTOs, requirements* 0.2.5 - A better way for finding the ontology form when setting up line types.* 0.2.4 - Add a few more DTO fields.

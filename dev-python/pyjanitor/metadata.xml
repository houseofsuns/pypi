	<longdescription>`pyjanitor` is a Python implementation of the R package [`janitor`][janitor], andprovides a clean API for cleaning data.[janitor]: https://github.com/sfirke/janitor## Quick start- Installation: `conda install -c conda-forge pyjanitor`. Read more installation instructions [here](https://pyjanitor-devs.github.io/pyjanitor/#installation).- Check out the collection of [general functions](https://pyjanitor-devs.github.io/pyjanitor/api/functions/).## Why janitor?Originally a port of the R package,`pyjanitor` has evolved from a set of convenient data cleaning routinesinto an experiment with the [`method chaining`][mc] paradigm.[mc]: https://towardsdatascience.com/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-method-chaining-in-pandas-15c2109e3c69Data preprocessing usually consists of a series of stepsthat involve transforming raw data into an understandable/usable format.These series of steps need to be run in a certain sequence to achieve success.We take a base data file as the starting point,and perform actions on it,such as removing null/empty rows,replacing them with other values,adding/renaming/removing columns of data,filtering rows and others.More formally, these steps along with their relationshipsand dependencies are commonly referred to as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).The `pandas` API has been invaluable for the Python data science ecosystem,and implements method chaining of a subset of methods as part of the API.For example, resetting indexes (`.reset_index()`),dropping null values (`.dropna()`), and more,are accomplished via the appropriate `pd.DataFrame` method calls.Inspired by the ease-of-useand expressiveness of the `dplyr` packageof the R statistical language ecosystem,we have evolved `pyjanitor` into a languagefor expressing the data processing DAG for `pandas` users.## Installation`pyjanitor` is currently installable from PyPI:```bashpip install pyjanitor````pyjanitor` also can be installed by the conda package manager:```bashconda install pyjanitor -c conda-forge````pyjanitor` can be installed by the pipenv environment manager too. This requires enabling prerelease dependencies:```bashpipenv install --pre pyjanitor````pyjanitor` requires Python 3.6+.## FunctionalityCurrent functionality includes:- Cleaning columns name (multi-indexes are possible!)- Removing empty rows and columns- Identifying duplicate entries- Encoding columns as categorical- Splitting your data into features and targets (for machine learning)- Adding, removing, and renaming columns- Coalesce multiple columns into a single column- Date conversions (from matlab, excel, unix) to Python datetime format- Expand a single column that has delimited, categorical values  into dummy-encoded variables- Concatenating and deconcatenating columns, based on a delimiter- Syntactic sugar for filtering the dataframe based on queries on a column- Experimental submodules for finance, biology, chemistry, engineering, and pyspark</longdescription>

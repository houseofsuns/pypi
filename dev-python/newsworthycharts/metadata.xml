	<longdescription>This  module contains methods for producing graphs and publishing them on Amazon S3, or in the location of your choice.It is written and maintained for `Newsworthy &lt;https://www.newsworthy.se/en/&gt;`_, but could possibly come in handy for other people as well.By `Journalism++ Stockholm &lt;http://jplusplus.org/sv&gt;`_.Installing----------.. code-block:: bash  pip install newsworthychartsUsing-----This module comes with two classes, `Chart` and `Storage` (and it's subclasses).When using the Chart class, the generated chart will be saved as a local file:.. code-block:: python3  from newsworthycharts import SerialChart as Chart  c = Chart(600, 800)  c.title = &quot;Number of smiles per second&quot;  c.xlabel = &quot;Time&quot;  c.ylabel = &quot;Smiles&quot;  c.caption = &quot;Source: Ministry of smiles.&quot;  data_serie_1 = [(&quot;2008-01-01&quot;, 6.1), (&quot;2009-01-01&quot;, 5.9), (&quot;2010-01-01&quot;, 6.8)]  c.data.append(data_serie_1)  c.highlight = &quot;2010-01-01&quot;  c.render(&quot;test&quot;, &quot;png&quot;)You can use one of the predefine chart classes to make common chart types. Or you can use Newsworthycharts together with Matplotlib. This is useful is you just want to add text elements such as subtitle, notes or apply a predefine theme.Here is how you would make a pie chart:.. code-block:: python3  # data  labels = 'Frogs', 'Hogs', 'Dogs', 'Logs'  sizes = [15, 30, 45, 10]  # setup chart  chart = Chart(width=800, height=600, storage=local_storage)  chart.title = &quot;My pie chart&quot;  chart.subtitle = &quot;Look at all those colors&quot;  # NB: Render the chart to `chart.ax`  chart.ax.pie(sizes, labels=labels, autopct='%1.1f%%')  # Save the chart  chart.render(&quot;tailored_chart&quot;, &quot;png&quot;)You can use a _storage_ object to save file toa specific location or cloud service:.. code-block:: python3  from newsworthycharts import Chart  from newsworthycharts import S3Storage  s3 = S3Storage(&quot;my_bucket&quot;)  c = Chart(600, 800, storage=s3)  c.title = &quot;Number of smiles per second&quot;  c.subtitle = &quot;This chart tells you something very important.&quot;  c.xlabel = &quot;Time&quot;  c.ylabel = &quot;Smiles&quot;  c.note = &quot;There are some missing smiles in data&quot;  c.caption = &quot;Source: Ministry of smiles.&quot;  c.render(&quot;test&quot;, &quot;png&quot;)To store a file in a local folder, use the `LocalStorage` class:.. code-block:: python3  from newsworthycharts import LocalStorage  storage = LocalStorage(&quot;/path/to/generated/charts&quot;)Charts are styled using built-in or user-defined styles:.. code-block:: python3  from newsworthycharts import Chart  # This chart has the newsworthy default style  c = Chart(600, 800, style=&quot;newsworthy&quot;)  # Style can also be the path to a style file (absolute or relative to current working directory)  c2 = Chart(600, 800, style=&quot;path/to/styles/mystyle.mplstyle&quot;)To set up you own style, copy the build-in default: &lt;https://github.com/jplusplus/newsworthycharts/blob/master/newsworthycharts/rc/newsworthy&gt;Newsworthycharts will look first among the predefined style files for the requested style, so if you have a custom style file in you working directory you need to give it a unique name not already in use.Options-------**Chart**- data: A list of datasets- annotate_trend = True  # Print out values at points on trendline?- trendline = []  # List of x positions, or data points- labels = []  # Optionally one label for each dataset- annotations = []  # Manually added annotations- interval = None  # yearly|quarterly|monthly|weekly|daily- units = 'number'  # number|percent|degrees- show_ticks = True  # toggle category names, dates, etc- subtitle = None- note = None- xlabel = None- ylabel = None- caption = None- highlight = A position (typically a date, category label or index) to highlight. The semantics may differ somewhat between chart types.- decimals = None  # None means automatically chose the best number- logo = None  # Path to image that will be embedded in the caption area. Can also be set though a style property- color_fn = None  # Custom coloring functionDeveloping----------To run tests:.. code-block:: python3  python3 -m flake8  python3 -m pytestDeployment----------To deploy a new version to [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/newsworthycharts):1. Update Changelog below.2. Update the version number in newsworthycharts/__init__.py3. Create and push a git tag: `git tag VERSION; git push --tags` (not strictly needed, but nice)4. Build: `python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel`5. Check: `python3 -m twine check dist/newsworthycharts-X.Y.X*`6. Upload: `python3 -m twine upload dist/newsworthycharts-X.Y.X*`...assuming you have Twine installed (`pip3 install twine`) and configured.Roadmap-------  - Adding more base maps  - Getting rid of custom settings-hack  - Custom month locator with equal-width month barsChangelog---------- 1.54.1  - Patch upgrade Matplotlib to 3.8.1- 1.54.0  - Treat 'jpeg' format as 'jpg'  - Fixed a rendering bug in stacked bar charts with multiple values being 0  - Pillow upgraded to 10.1- 1.53.0  - Fixed bug in value_labels, trying to access a color value that didn't exist  - Dropped Python 3.7 support (upstream)  - Uses Matplotlib 3.8  - Uses Pillow 10- 1.52.1  - Fixed date formatting issue in daily charts- 1.52.0  - No longer render EPS files by default.- 1.51.2  - _Really_ fix dependencies- 1.51.1  - Fix error in dependency verison- 1.51.0  - Added `BubbleMap`  - Added `se-4` basemap for Swedish counties  - Basemaps can now have multiplygons  - Downgraded adjustText to 0.7.3, as upgrade broke rendering constistency in some places- 1.50.2  - Revert `matplotlib-label-lines` to previous version. - 1.50.0  - Dropped Python 3.7 support (upstream)  - Pinned Pillow to exact version in setup.py, for consistent rendering  - `StripeChart`: First draft- 1.49.1  - `ProgressChart`: Better value label placement. - 1.49.0  - `ProgressChart`: Enable custom value labels as third argument in data serie.- 1.48.2    - Bug fix: Handle translation in inset maps in `ChoroplethMap`. - 1.48.1  - Bug fix: Path to translation file in `ChoroplethMap`. - 1.48.0  - `ChoroplethMap`: Allow Newsworthy region names.  - `RangePlot`: Re-add `start_label` that had been (mistakenly?) commented out.- 1.47.2  - Bug fix: Fixes legend issue in `ProgressChart`. - 1.47.1  - Data point annotation now works for serial charts as well  - Bug fix: Re-enable `qualitative_colors` as `color` argument in SerialChart (line). - 1.47.0  - Support for rendering jpeg files, as `jpg`  - Minimum required Python version is now 3.7 (jumping from 3.5)  - Matplotlib@3.7.1- 1.46.3  - Fix z-ordering issue on multiple series (n &gt; 2)- 1.46.2  - Fix tag mismatch in dist- 1.46.1  - Add missing haversine transform for non-projected crs- 1.46.0    - `height` can be set to None for automatic ratio, for chart types that support it. Will default to 1:1 for most chart types, but maps will try to provide a reasonable default based on geometry. Some chart types still require explicit height  - It is now possible to use subsets of basemaps, by specifying a prefix: `se|03-7` means regions starting with `03` in `se-7`  - Added .missing_label to ChoroplethMap. If None (default), no label will be printed.  - Always accentuate base_line (/y=0), and make sure that line is on top of any bars to avoid “floating” bars  - Improved error handling in ChoroplethMap  - Clean up figure layout logic (this should speed up rendering somewhat)- 1.45.0  - Increased default `max_ticks` in SerialChart to 7  - Matplotlib==3.7.0  - adjustText==0.8.0  - ChoroplethMap legend formatting, following language, decimals and units settings, etc  - Minor tweaks to the layout algorithm.

Using a string is still supported for backwards compability. This makes it possible to make mixed type charts.  - Reworked, simpler and more stable bar coloring algorithm  - The `type` argument is no longer a getter/setter  - Reduced edge for bar chartswith many bars  - Removed unused, undocumented special colors value `&quot;qualitative_colors&quot;`. We have reasonable defaults for all chart types, that can already be overridden. The qualitative colors are used by default for qualitative data.  - Removed unused, undocumented support for highlighting a series by label, rather than a value. The first series is highlighted by default, and that behaviour can already be overriden by the `.colors` setting- 1.43.4  - Add more space for label title on se-7 maps- 1.43.3  - Don't try to render map insets with no data  - Use style colors in categorical choropleth maps  - Added missing support for coloring categorical maps with `.colors`  - Make automatic labeling work on categorical maps with `.colors`  - Somewhat lighter fill for missing values in choropleth maps (lightgray -&gt; gainsboro)  - Testing experimental label_title support, to be documented in 1.44.0- 1.43.2  - Fixed weird ymax in some baseline cases  - Added bottom padding when baseline was below data-min  - 1.43.1  - Fixed cut off-bug with negative baseline  - Fix coloring bug in warm_cold color_fn with baseline   - Fix regression with quarterly locator- 1.43.0  - Default to weekdays on x-axis if data spans 7 days or less  - Added `.color_labels` to label bar colors set by `.color_fn`- 1.42.0  - Added `.baseline` setting for bar charts  - `warm_cold` coloring algorithm now works relative `.baseline`  - Added `.baseline_annotation`  - `.color_fn` can now be a lambda function (or the name of one of the built in functions), e.g. `chart.color_fn = lambda x: &quot;red&quot; if x &lt; 1.4 else &quot;green&quot;`  - Bar charts will now always have a small white edge  - Don't break y axis if data is close to 0  - Offset quarters will be recognosed as quarters now (e.g. Feb, May, Aug, Nov)  - Fixed bug in .allow_broken_y_axis implementation, causing y-axis to be broken in too many places  - Various dependency updates  - Replaced deprecated PIL.Image.ANTIALIAS with PIL.Image.Resampling.LANCZOS for logotype resizing.  - Get rid of warnings about missing “glyph 10” when prerendering text to calculate text bos sizes  - Fixed bug where single values surrounded my None's were not printed out in serial-data line charts. This was an earlier regression that was not noticed for many releases.- 1.41.0  - New, experimental chart type: Choropleth maps! Supports both categorical and continuous data.   - Better support for monthly time series spanning years  - Fixed bug where missing annotation slots could crash CategoricalChart- 1.40.2  - Don't crash on deprecation warning  - Matplotlib upgraded from 3.6.2 to 3.6.3  - Pin some critical requirement versions- 1.40.1  - Fix floating point bug in percent labels  - Test fixes- 1.40.0  - Auto-decide `.decimals` if None  - Round 0.5 to 1, etc in value axis labels and annotations (the `ROUND_HALF_UP` behaviour)  - Add `.force_decimals` to print out e.g. ”1.0”.

Make all numbers equal. Use `units=&quot;number&quot;` and `decimals=0` to get the earlier behaviour.  - Remove overriding of decimal settings by units = count  - Remove noisy deprecation warning on user settings in rc files  - Formatters will now use the correct minus signs for the given locale.- 1.39.1  - Added missing metadata to svg  - Added .__version__ attribute to the package- 1.39.0  - Added pdf export, now more widely used than eps  - Author and software metadata now added to pdf and png, including the exakt NWCharts version used to produce an image- 1.38.2    - `S3Storage`: Handle text files.- 1.38.1  - Prevent logo from ever being &gt; 155px, to restore previous behaviour.- 1.38.0  - Made multi series bar seasonal bar charts work for opposite signs, so that we can make +/- charts- 1.37.3  - Bug fix: Don't crash with factor argument in DW charts.- 1.37.2  - Fixed rendering bug in non-transparent eps exports with transparent logos- 1.37.1  - Fixed bug in argument parsing in S3Storage.save()- 1.37.0  - Added `storage_options` argument to `render()` and `render_all()`  - Unified function signatures across storage classes.- 1.36.0  - Added options argument to `S3Storage.save()`- 1.35.0  - Enable logo scaling.

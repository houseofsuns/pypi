	<longdescription>|pypi| |actions| |coverage|edc-form-label--------------Customize Django's form label in realtimeFor a sequence of data collection timepoints, we ask the question, &quot;Are you circumcised?&quot;. At some time point we hope the response will be `YES`, but until then, we need to ask &quot;Since we last saw you, were you circumcised?&quot;. It is a lot better if we can ask, &quot;Since we last saw you in 'October 2018', were you circumcised?&quot;, where 'October 2018' represents the timepoint from which we got our last reponse.This module shows how you can insert 'October 2018' into the ModelAdmin/ModelForm the form label in realtime.For example:For a sequence of data collection timepoints, we ask the question, &quot;Are you circumcised&quot;.

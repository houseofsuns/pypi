However, both community and author need to be aligned. When users,developers, the community, needs a fix which are important for their projects, but there is no answer from the author,or the time for response is not enough, then the most plausible way is forking and continuing a parallel development.That's way we forked the original and accepted most of PRs waiting for review since jun/2019 (5 months from now).### Features * Python 2 and 3 compatible * Automatic correction of   * Linefeeds according to patched file   * Diffs broken by stripping trailing whitespace   * a/ and b/ prefixes * Single file, which is a command line tool and a library * No dependencies outside Python stdlib * Patch format detection (SVN, HG, GIT) * Nice diffstat histogram * Linux / Windows / OS X * Test coverageThings that don't work out of the box: * File renaming, creation and removal * Directory tree operations * Version control specific properties * Non-unified diff formats### UsageDownload **patch_ng.py** and run it with Python. It is a self-containedmodule without external dependencies.    patch_ng.py diff.patchYou can also run the .zip file.    python patch-ng-1.17.zip diff.patch### Installation**patch_ng.py** is self sufficient. You can copy it into your repositoryand use it from here. This setup will always be repeatable. But ifyou need to add `patch` module as a dependency, make sure to use strictspecifiers to avoid hitting an API break when version 2 is released:    pip install &quot;patch-ng&quot;### Other stuff* [CHANGES](doc/CHANGES.md)* [LICENSE: MIT](LICENSE)* [CREDITS](doc/CREDITS)</longdescription>

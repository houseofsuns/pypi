It is broken into two components:- ``psycopg2_mq.MQWorker`` - a reusable worker object that manages a  single-threaded worker that can accept jobs and execute them. An application  should create worker per thread. It supports an API for thread-safe graceful  shutdown.- ``psycopg2_mq.MQSource`` - a source object providing a client-side API for  invoking and querying job states.It is expected that these core components are then wrapped into your ownapplication in any way that you see fit, without dictating a specific CLIor framework.Data Model==========Queues------Workers run jobs defined in queues. Currently each queue will run jobsconcurrently, while a future version may support serial execution on aper-queue basis. Each registered queue should contain an ``execute_job(job)``method.Jobs----The ``execute_job`` method of a queue is passed a ``Job`` object containingthe following attributes:- ``id``- ``queue``- ``method``- ``args``- ``cursor``As a convenience, there is an ``extend(**kw)`` method which can be used toadd extra attributes to the object. This is useful in individual queues todefine a contract between a queue and its methods.Cursors-------A ``Job`` can be scheduled with a ``cursor_key``. There can only be onepending job and one running job for any cursor. New jobs scheduled whileanother one is pending will be ignored and the pending job is returned.A ``job.cursor`` dict is provided to the workers containing the cursor data,and is saved back to the database when the job is completed. This effectivelygives jobs some persistent, shared state, and serializes all jobs over a givencursor.Delayed Jobs------------A ``Job`` can be delayed to run in the future by providing a ``datetime``object to the ``when`` argument. This, along with a cursor key, can provide anice throttle on how frequently a job runs. For example, delay jobs to runin 30 seconds with a ``cursor_key`` and any jobs that are scheduled in themeantime will be dropped. The assumption here is that the arguments areconstant and data for execution is in the cursor or another table. As a lastresort, a ``conflict_resolver`` callback can be used to modify properties ofthe job when arguments cannot be constant.Schedules---------A ``JobSchedule`` can be defined which supports`RFC 5545 &lt;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545&gt;`__ ``RRULE`` schedules. Theseare powerful and can support timezones, frequencies based on calendars as wellas simple recurring rules from an anchor time using ``DTSTART``. Cron jobscan be converted to this syntax for simpler scenarios.``psycopg2-mq`` workers will automatically negotiate which worker is responsiblefor managing schedules so clustered workers should operate as expected.Example Worker==============.. code-block:: python    from psycopg2_mq import (        MQWorker,        make_default_model,    )    from sqlalchemy import (        MetaData,        create_engine,    )    import sys    class EchoQueue:        def execute_job(self, job):            return f'hello, {job.args[&quot;name&quot;]} from method=&quot;{job.method}&quot;'    if __name__ == '__main__':        engine = create_engine(sys.argv[1])        metadata = MetaData()        model = make_default_model(metadata)        worker = MQWorker(            engine=engine,            queues={                'echo': EchoQueue(),            },            model=model,        )        worker.run()Example Source==============.. code-block:: python    engine = create_engine()    metadata = MetaData()    model = make_default_model(metadata)    session_factory = sessionmaker()    session_factory.configure(bind=engine)    dbsession = session_factory()    with dbsession.begin():        mq = MQSource(            dbsession=dbsession,            model=model,        )        job = mq.call('echo', 'hello', {'name': 'Andy'})        print(f'queued job={job.id}')Changes=======0.9 (2023-04-21)----------------- Add support for Python 3.10, and 3.11.- [breaking] Prevent retrying of collapsible jobs. Require them to be invoked  using ``call`` instead for an opportunity to specify a ``conflict_resolver``.- Fix a bug in the default model schema in which the collapsible database  index was not marked unique.- Copy trace info when retrying a job.- Capture the stringified exception to the job result in the ``message`` key,  alongside the existing ``tb``, ``exc``, and ``args`` keys.- The worker was not recognizing ``capture_signals=False``, causing problems  when running the event loop in other threads.- Blackify the codebase and add some real tests. Yay!0.8.3 (2022-04-15)------------------- [breaking] Remove ``MQWorker.make_job_context``.0.8.2 (2022-04-15)------------------- Drop Python 3.6 support.- [breaking] Require SQLAlchemy 1.4+ and resolve deprecation warnings related to  SQLAlchemy 2.0.- [breaking] Rename ``update_job_id`` to ``updated_job_id`` in the  ``JobCursor`` model.0.8.1 (2022-04-15)------------------- Ensure the ``trace`` attribute is populated on the ``JobContext``.- Add ``MQWorker.make_job_context`` which can be defined to completely override  the ``JobContext`` factory using the ``Job`` object and open database session.0.8.0 (2022-04-15)------------------- [breaking] Add ``update_job_id`` foreign key to the ``JobCursor`` model to  make it possible to know which job last updated the value in the cursor.- [breaking] Add ``trace`` json blob to the ``Job`` model.- Support a ``trace`` json blob when creating new jobs. This value is available  on the running job context and can be used when creating sub-jobs or when  making requests to external systems to pass through tracing metadata.  See ``MQSource.call``'s new ``trace`` parameter when creating jobs.  See ``JobContext.trace`` attribute when handling jobs.- Add a standard ``FailedJobError`` exception which can be raised by jobs to  mark a failure with a custom result object. This is different from unhandled  exceptions that cause the ``MQWorker.result_from_error`` method to be invoked.0.7.0 (2022-03-03)------------------- Fix a corner case with lost jobs attached to cursors. In scenarios where  multiple workers are running, if one loses a database connection then the  other is designed to notice and mark jobs lost. However, it's possible the  job is not actually lost and the worker can then recover after resuming  its connection, and marking the job running again. In this situation, we  do not want another job to begin on the same cursor. To fix this issue,  new jobs will not be run if another job is marked lost on the same cursor.  You will be required to recover the job by marking it as not lost (probably  failed) first to unblock the rest of the jobs on the cursor.0.6.2 (2022-03-01)------------------- Prioritize maintenance work higher than running new jobs.  There was a chicken-and-egg issue where a job would be marked running  but needs to be marked lost. However marking it lost is lower priority than  trying to start new jobs. In the case where a lot of jobs were scheduled  at the same time, the worker always tried to start new jobs and didn't  run the maintenance so the job never got marked lost, effectively blocking  the queue.0.6.1 (2022-01-15)------------------- Fix a bug introduced in the 0.6.0 release when scheduling new jobs.0.6.0 (2022-01-14)------------------- [breaking] Add model changes to mark jobs as collapsible.- [breaking] Add model changes to the cursor index.- Allow multiple pending jobs to be scheduled on the same cursor if either:  1. The queue or method are different from existing pending jobs on the cursor.  2. ``collapse_on_cursor`` is set to ``False`` when scheduling the job.0.5.7 (2021-03-07)------------------- Add a ``schedule_id`` attribute to the job context for use in jobs that want  to know whether they were executed from a schedule or not.0.5.6 (2021-02-28)------------------- Some UnicodeDecodeError exceptions raised from jobs could trigger a  serialization failure (UntranslatableCharacter) because it would contain  the sequence ``\u0000``` which, while valid in Python, is not allowed  in postgres. So when dealing with the raw bytes, we'll decode it with  the replacement character that can be properly stored. Not ideal, but  better than failing to store the error at all.0.5.5 (2021-01-22)------------------- Fixed some old code causing the worker lock to release after a job  completed.0.5.4 (2021-01-20)------------------- Log at the error level when marking a job as lost.0.5.3 (2021-01-11)------------------- Copy the ``schedule_id`` information to retried jobs.0.5.2 (2021-01-11)------------------- [breaking] Require ``call_schedule`` to accept an id instead of an object.0.5.1 (2021-01-09)------------------- Drop the ``UNIQUE`` constraint on the background job ``lock_id`` column.0.5 (2021-01-09)----------------- Add a scheduler model with support for emitting periodic jobs based on  RRULE syntax.  See https://github.com/mmerickel/psycopg2_mq/pull/11- Enable the workers to coordinate on a per-queue basis who is in control  of scheduling jobs.  See https://github.com/mmerickel/psycopg2_mq/pull/12- Reduce the number of advisory locks held from one per job to one per worker.  See https://github.com/mmerickel/psycopg2_mq/pull/120.4.5 (2020-12-22)------------------- Use column objects in the insert statement to support ORM-level synonyms,  enabling the schema to have columns with different names.0.4.4 (2019-11-07)------------------- Ensure the advisory locks are released when a job completes.0.4.3 (2019-10-31)------------------- Ensure maintenance (finding lost jobs) always runs at set intervals defined  by the ``timeout`` parameter.0.4.2 (2019-10-30)------------------- Recover active jobs when the connection is lost by re-locking them  and ensuring they are marked running.0.4.1 (2019-10-30)------------------- Attempt to reconnect to the database after losing the connection.  If the reconnect attempt fails then crash.0.4 (2019-10-28)----------------- Add a ``worker`` column to the ``Job`` model to track what worker  is handling a job.- Add an optional ``name`` argument to ``MQWorker`` to name the worker -  the value will be recorded in each job.- Add a ``threads`` argument (default=``1``) to ``MQWorker`` to support  handling multiple jobs from the same worker instance instead of making a  worker per thread.- Add ``capture_signals`` argument (default=``True``) to ``MQWorker`` which  will capture ``SIGTERM``, ``SIGINT`` and ``SIGUSR1``. The first two will  trigger graceful shutdown - they will make the process stop handling new  jobs while finishing active jobs. The latter will dump to ``stderr`` a  JSON dump of the current status of the worker.0.3.3 (2019-10-23)------------------- Only save a cursor update if the job is completed successfully.0.3.2 (2019-10-22)------------------- Mark lost jobs during timeouts instead of just when a worker starts in order  to catch them earlier.0.3.1 (2019-10-17)------------------- When attempting to schedule a job with a cursor and a ``scheduled_time``  earlier than a pending job on the same cursor, the job will be updated to  run at the earlier time.- When attempting to schedule a job with a cursor and a pending job already  exists on the same cursor, a ``conflict_resolver`` function may be  supplied to ``MQSource.call`` to update the job properties, merging the  arguments however the user wishes.0.3 (2019-10-15)----------------- Add a new column ``cursor_snapshot`` to the ``Job`` model which will  contain the value of the cursor when the job begins.0.2 (2019-10-09)----------------- Add cursor support for jobs. This requires a schema migration to add  a ``cursor_key`` column, a new ``JobCursor`` model, and some new indices.0.1.6 (2019-10-07)------------------- Support passing custom kwargs to the job in ``psycopg2_mq.MQSource.call``  to allow custom columns on the job table.0.1.5 (2019-05-17)------------------- Fix a regression when serializing errors with strings or cycles.0.1.4 (2019-05-09)------------------- More safely serialize exception objects when jobs fail.0.1.3 (2018-09-04)------------------- Rename the thread to contain the job id while it's handling a job.0.1.2 (2018-09-04)------------------- Rename ``Job.params`` to ``Job.args``.0.1.1 (2018-09-04)------------------- Make ``psycopg2`` an optional dependency in order to allow apps to depend  on ``psycopg2-binary`` if they wish.0.1 (2018-09-04)----------------- Initial release.</longdescription>

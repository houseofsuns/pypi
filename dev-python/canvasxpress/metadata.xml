It supports a large numberof [visualizations ](https://www.canvasxpress.org/examples.html)to display scientific and non-scientific data. ***CanvasXpress*** also includes a simple and unobtrusive[user interface](https://www.canvasxpress.org/docs/interface.html) to explore complex data sets, a sophisticated andunique mechanism to keep track of all user customization for[Reproducible Research ](https://www.canvasxpress.org/docs/audit.html) purposes, as well as an 'out of the box'broadcasting capability to synchronize selected data points across all ***CanvasXpress*** plots in a page. Data can beeasily sorted, grouped, transposed, transformed or clustered dynamically. The fully customizable mouse events as well asthe zooming, panning and drag-and-drop capabilities are features that make this library unique in its class.&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docinfosci/canvasxpress-python/main/readme/images/sample_graphs.png&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;726&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;***CanvasXpress*** can be now be used within Python for native integration into IPython and Web environments, such as:- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)- [Plotly Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/)- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)Complete examples using the ***CanvasXpress*** library including the mouse events, zooming, and broadcastingcapabilities are included in this package. This***CanvasXpress*** Python package was created by Dr. Todd C. Brett, with support from[Aggregate Genius Inc.](https://www.aggregate-genius.com), in cooperation with the***CanvasXpress*** team.The maintainer of the Python edition of this package is [Dr. Todd C.

You have created a Plotly Dash CanvasXpress app!### A Quick Flask Example[Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) is a popular lean Web development framework for Python based applications.Flask applications can serve Web pages, RESTful APIs, and similar backend service concepts. This example shows how tocreate a basic Flask application that provides a basic Web page with a CanvasXpress chart composed using Python in thebackend.The concepts in this example equally apply to other frameworks that can serve Web pages, such as Django and Tornado.#### Create a Basic Flask AppA basic Flask app provides a means by which:1. A local development server can be started1. A function can respond to a URLFirst install Flask and CanvasXpress for Python:```terminalpip install -U Flask canvasxpress```Then create a demo file, such as `app.py`, and insert:```python# save this as app.pyfrom flask import Flaskapp = Flask(__name__)@app.route('/')def canvasxpress_example():    return &quot;Hello!&quot;```On the command line, execute:```terminalflask run```And output similar to the following will be provided:```terminalRunning on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)```Browsing to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` will result in a page with the text*Hello!*.#### Add a ChartCanvasXpress for Python can be used to define a chart with various attributes and then generate the necessary HTML andJavascript for proper display in the browser.Add a `templates` directory to the same location as the `app.py` file, and inside add a filecalled `canvasxpress_example.html`. Inside the file add:```html&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;    &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;    &lt;title&gt;Flask CanvasXpress Example&lt;/title&gt;    &lt;!-- 2. Include the CanvasXpress library --&gt;    &lt;link            href='https://www.canvasxpress.org/dist/canvasXpress.css'            rel='stylesheet'            type='text/css'    /&gt;    &lt;script            src='https://www.canvasxpress.org/dist/canvasXpress.min.js'            type='text/javascript'&gt;    &lt;/script&gt;    &lt;!-- 3. Include script to initialize object --&gt;    &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;        onReady(function () {            {                {                    canvas_source | safe                }            }        })    &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;!-- 1. DOM element where the visualization will be displayed --&gt;{{canvas_element|safe}}&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;```The HTML file, which uses [Jinja syntax](https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/) achieves three things:1. Provides a location for a `&lt;div&gt;` element that marks where the chart will be placed.1. References the CanvasXpress CSS and JS files needed to illustrate and operate the charts.1. Provides a location for the Javascript that will replace the chart `&lt;div&gt;` with a working element on page load.Going back to our Flask app, we can add a basic chart definition with some data to our example function:```pythonfrom flask import Flask, render_templatefrom canvasxpress.canvas import CanvasXpressapp = Flask(__name__)@app.route('/')def canvasxpress_example():    # Define a CX bar chart with some basic data    chart: CanvasXpress = CanvasXpress(        data={            &quot;y&quot;: {                &quot;vars&quot;: [&quot;Gene1&quot;],                &quot;smps&quot;: [&quot;Smp1&quot;, &quot;Smp2&quot;, &quot;Smp3&quot;],                &quot;data&quot;: [[10, 35, 88]]            }        },        config={            &quot;graphType&quot;: &quot;Bar&quot;        }    )    # Get the HTML parts for use in our Web page:    html_parts: dict = chart.render_to_html_parts()    # Return a Web page based on canvasxpress_example.html and our HTML parts    return render_template(        &quot;canvasxpress_example.html&quot;,        canvas_element=html_parts[&quot;cx_canvas&quot;],        canvas_source=html_parts[&quot;cx_js&quot;]    )```#### Run the App and View the PageRerun the flask app on the command line and browse to the indicated IP and URL. A page similar to the following will bedisplayed:&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docinfosci/canvasxpress-python/main/readme/examples/flask_bar_chart_basic.png&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Congratulations!  You have created a Flask CanvasXpress app!</longdescription>

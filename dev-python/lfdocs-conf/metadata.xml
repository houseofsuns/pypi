	<longdescription>LF Docs Config==============The purpose of this project is to allow LF projects a centralized location forstoring common project configuration.To use this a project should create a conf.yaml file in the samedirectory as their conf.py. The minimal configuration for ``conf.py`` is::    from docs_conf import *The minimal configuration for ``conf.yaml`` file is::    ---    project_cfg=myprojectDocs will load default configuration for 'myproject' from this package if itexists, otherwise it will load basic configuration from Sphinx defaults.Configuration precedence for configuration is as follows:#. project/conf.py#. project/conf.yaml#. docs_conf/defaults/{project_cfg}.yaml#. docs_conf/defaults/default.yaml#. docs_conf/__init__.py``conf.py`` structure and documentation:  http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/config.htmlTODO----- [ ] Define the minimal set of config values to release initial version.      These can probably come from ODL/OPNFV site conf.py files.- [ ] Use sane defaults, and don't error out if something is not set.      We must import each config cleanly (if it doesn't      exist, set None or something; like the function dict.get()).- [ ] Create own documentation for project detailing use of 'conf.cfg'      file as some values will require subkeys given that they're      dictionaries or expect a list of tuples.- [ ] Setup and document section. With the documentation organized by section,      the config should also contain these section and look for their values      under them.      Sections:        - general (aka sphinx)        - project        - i18n        - html_output        - apple_help        - epub_output        - latex_output        - text_output        - manpage_output        - texinfo_output        - linkcheck        - xml        - cplusplus- [ ] Configure pre-plugin sections, and reference by plugin listing.</longdescription>

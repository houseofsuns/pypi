	<longdescription># IAM Builder[![Actions Status](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/iam_builder/workflows/IAM%20Builder/badge.svg)](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/iam_builder/actions)A python script to generate an IAM policy based on a yaml or json configuration.To install:```# Most stablepip install iam-builder# OR directly from githubpip install git+git://github.com/moj-analytical-services/iam_builder.git#egg=iam_builder```To use the command line interface:```iam_builder -c examples/iam_config.yaml -o examples/iam_policy.json```- `-c` is the path to your iam configuration (either a yaml or json file).- `-o` is the path to your output iam policy (needs to be a json file).Or to do the same thing in python:```pythonimport yamlimport jsonfrom iam_builder.iam_builder import build_iam_policywith open('examples/iam_config.yaml') as f:  config = yaml.load(f, Loader=yaml.FullLoader)iam_policy = build_iam_policy(config)with open('examples/iam_policy.json', &quot;w+&quot;) as f:  json.dump(iam_policy, f, indent=4, separators=(',', ': '))```Both scripts will create the output iam_policy seen in the [examples](examples/) folder. You can also see [more example configs](tests/test_config/) by looking in the unit tests.Your config file can be either a yaml or json file.The example yaml (`iam_config.yaml`) looks this:```yamliam_role_name: iam_role_nameathena:  write: falseglue_job: truesecrets: trues3:   read_only:    - test_bucket_read_only/*  write_only:    - test_bucket_write_only/*    - test_bucket_read_only/write_only_folder/*  read_write:    - test_bucket_read_write/*    - test_bucket_read_only/write_folder/*  deny:    - test_bucket_read_write/sensitive_table/*```Whilst the example json (`iam_config.json`) looks like this:```json{  &quot;iam_role_name&quot;: &quot;iam_role_name&quot;,  &quot;athena&quot;: {    &quot;write&quot;: false  },  &quot;glue_job&quot;: true,  &quot;secrets&quot;: true,  &quot;s3&quot;: {    &quot;read_only&quot;: [      &quot;test_bucket_read_only/*&quot;    ],    &quot;write_only&quot;: [      &quot;test_bucket_write_only/*&quot;,      &quot;test_bucket_read_only/write_only_folder/*&quot;    ],    &quot;read_write&quot;: [      &quot;test_bucket_read_write/*&quot;,      &quot;test_bucket_read_only/write_folder/*&quot;    ]  }}```- **iam_role_name:** The role name of your airflow job; required if you want to run glue jobs or access secrets.- **athena:** Can have two keys.   - **write**: Either `true` or `false`. If `false` then only read access to Athena (cannot create, delete or alter tables, databases and partitions). If `true` then the role will also have the ability to do stuff like CTAS queries, `DROP TABLE`, `CREATE DATABASE`, etc.  - **dump_bucket**: The location in S3 (either an S3 path or a list of S3 paths) for temporarily storing the results of queries. This defaults to `mojap-athena-query-dump` and should not normally need changing.- **glue_job:** Boolean; must be set to `true` to allow role to run glue jobs. If `false` or absent role will not be able to run glue jobs.- **secrets:** Boolean or string; must be set to `true` or `&quot;read&quot;` to allow role to access secrets from AWS Parameter Store, and `readwrite` to provide read/write access. If `false` or absent role will not be able to access secrets.- **s3:** Can have up to 4 keys: `read_only`, `write_only`, `read_write`, and `deny`. Each key describes the level of access you want your iam policy to have with each s3 path. More details below:    - **read_only:** A list of s3 paths that the iam_role should be able to access (read only). Each item in the list should either be a path to a object or finish with `/*` to denote that it can access everything within that directory. _Note the S3 paths don't start with `s3://` in the config._  - **write_only:** A list of s3 paths that the iam_role should be able to access (write only). Each item in the list should either be a path to a object or finish with `/*` to denote that it can access everything within that directory. _Note the S3 paths don't start with `s3://` in the config._  - **read_write:** A list of s3 paths that the iam_role should be able to access (read and write). Each item in the list should either be a path to a object or finish with `/*` to denote that it can access everything within that directory. _Note the S3 paths don't start with `s3://` in the config._  - **deny:** A list of s3 paths that the iam_role should _not_ be able to access. This should be used to add exceptions to wildcarded access to folders, for example excluding sensitive tables in order to provide basic access to a database. Each item in the list should either be a path to a object or finish with `/*` to denote that it can access everything within that directory. _Note the S3 paths don't start with `s3://` in the config._## How to updateWhen updating IAM builder, make sure to change the version number in `pyproject.toml` and describe the change in `CHANGELOG.md`.If you have changed any dependencies in `pyproject.yaml`, run `poetry update` to update `poetry.lock`.Once you have created a release in GitHub, a Github Action will run to publish the release on PyPI automatically.</longdescription>

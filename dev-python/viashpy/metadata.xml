These versions of python must be made available to tox (by adding them to your `PATH` environment variable), for example by installing and enabling them using `pyenv`.Afterwards, running the tests is a matter of executing: ```bashtox .```Alternatively, if you wish to test for the python version installed on your system only, you can choose to only test `-e` parameter.```bash# Uses python3.7tox -e py3.7```# LicenseCopyright (C) 2020 Data IntuitiveThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

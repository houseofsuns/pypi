	<longdescription>## OverviewSPAR is a Python NLP package that facilitates interactive measurement of text using LLMs. With SPAR, you can quantify short documents (e.g., social media posts) based on theoretical concepts such as *`creativity`* and *`collaboration`*, by measuring their semantic similarity with a set of example (seed) documents. **How it works:**1. Start with      i. A corpus of documents that you want to measure;     ii. generic seed sentences that define theoretical concepts, e.g., `Creativity: we should innovate` and `Collaboration: we should collaborate`.   2. Embed them into a semantic space using a pre-trained LLM.3. Use semantic search to find domain-specific exemplary documents in the corpus that reflect the theoretical concepts in context. For example:  _`'We encourage new ways of thinking'`_, _`'We should working together to weather the storm'`_.4. Compute the dot product between docuements and exemplary documents. **Main features:*** Enables domain-adaptive and few-shot measurements of theoretical concepts without requiring model training or fine-tuning. * Combines the idea of semantic projection with active semantic search ([Grand et al. 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01316-8), Blinded Authors 2023), which allows users to find the most relevant, context-specific documents to define the theoretical scales. * Supports multiple state-of-the-arts text embedding models, such as [Sentence Transformers](https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html) and [OpenAI Text Embeddings API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings). * Comes with a user-friendly web interface that makes defining theoretical scales and conducting measurements intuitive and accessible. If you find SPAR useful in your work, please cite the following paper:* Blinded Authors (2023), A Computational Framework for Understanding Firm Communication During Disasters, Under Review at *Information Systems Research*.SPAR is built on open source packages such as [HuggingFace Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/), [SentenceTransformers](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers/), and [Gradio](https://gradio.app/). ## Installation and Quick StartTo quickly launch SPAR in Google Colab, click the following button and run the notebook code:[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/maifeng/SPAR_measure/blob/master/resources/example_colab.ipynb)You can also install SPAR on your own machine. It is recommended to use a virtual environment and upgrade pip first with `pip install -U pip`. SPAR can be installed via pip:     pip install -U spar-measureTo launch SPAR on your own machine, use the following command in the terminal:    python -m spar_measure.guiAnd open the interactive app in your browser at `http://localhost:7860/`.If a CUDA GPU is available, SPAR will use it to speed up embedding. If you choose not to use a GPU, you can set the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable to an empty string:    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=&quot;&quot; python -m spar_measure.gui## Limitations* SPAR may not be suitable for longer or more complex documents since it represents a document using a single vector.* Sentence embeddings may not be suitable for theoretical constructs that rely primarily on syntactic features.* Pretrained LLMs may not have up-to-date world knowledge or new vocabularies.* Semantic projection is a linear operation, so it may not capture non-linear patterns in the data as well as fine-tuning approaches.## Additional DetailsFor additional details and source code, please refer to the project's [GitHub Repository](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SPAR_measure-BF04/README.MD).</longdescription>

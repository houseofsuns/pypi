	<longdescription># Functional-FunctionsCreated by the FBI Compass team, this package contains our team's most commonly used and useful functions# AboutContents include functions for connecting to snowflake, saving and loading pickles. For help with what functions are available, please run help()# InstallationTo install functional-functions, you can install it using pip:````pythonpip install functional_functions````# Additional PrequisitesTo use the redshift query connector, you must additionally ensure you have downloaded/installed:* Java (Optional)    * You can usually install that from here: [JDK 16 Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk16-downloads.html)* JDK8 (Optional)    * For some reason, you may need this as well? This was troubleshooting I went through for setup    ````python    brew tap adoptopenjdk/openjdk    brew install --cask adoptopenjdk8    ````# UsageCurrently all files are in the init.py. Import each function as needed. First time users are encouraged to import and run help() for more info.````pythonimport functional_functions````````pythonfrom functional_functions import help, query_snowflake````# Troubleshooting/Prequisite/Additional NotesSome functions, especially the connections, are built off of a settings.py file which stores local creds. You can view a sample settings file called 'settings.py.sample' in the included files. Obviously feel free to use another method to store and provide creds if you want. We now have added the ability to directly reference environmental variables and/or a .env file. See creds.env.sample for example file.However if you are using 'settings.py' as your creds file, you will need to place it in your overall site-packages folder. If you are using 'creds.env' you will need to place it in your root folder or have a direct reference to it when you are loading it in. I'd recommend using python package python-dotenv.**NOTE**: Yes I know code shouldnt be stored in __init__.py, but I also am learning packages and such!.# Help/Issues/BugsPlease contact lawrence.chin@compass.com if there are any questions, bugs, or issues.</longdescription>

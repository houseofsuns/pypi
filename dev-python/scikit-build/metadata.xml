	<longdescription>**scikit-build** is a Python build system for CPython C/C++/Fortran/Cythonextensions using CMake.The scikit-build package is fundamentally just glue between the ``setuptools``Python module and `CMake`_.The next generation of scikit-build, `scikit-build-core`_, is currently under development.This provides a simple, reliable build backend for CMake that does not usesetuptools and provides a lot of new features. Scikit-build-core can also powera setuptools-based extension system, which will eventually become the backendfor scikit-build (classic). If you do not require extensive customization ofthe build process, you should consider trying scikit-build-core instead ofscikit-build.To get started, see `this example &lt;https://scikit-build.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#example-of-setup-py-cmakelists-txt-and-pyproject-toml&gt;`_. For more examples, see `scikit-build-sample-projects &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build-sample-projects&gt;`_.Scikit-build 0.17.6===================A small fix release with some new platforms and better testing, including CPython 3.12.0b1.Bug fixes---------* Support added for SunOS by `@mtelka &lt;https://github.com/mtelka&gt;`_ in `#983 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/983&gt;`_.* Support added for AIX (with recent CMake) by `@bhuntsman &lt;https://github.com/bhuntsman&gt;`_ in `#988 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/988&gt;`_.Testing-------* Tests now pass on CPython 3.12.0b1 in `#879 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/879&gt;`_.* Tests no longer use ``pytest-virtualenv`` in `#879 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/879&gt;`_.* ``isolated`` marker now includes ``test_distribution`` tests in `#879 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/879&gt;`_.* Tests avoid incorrect ``get_map`` match by `@keszybz &lt;https://github.com/keszybz&gt;`_ in `#990 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/990&gt;`_.* Fedora testing fix by `@LecrisUT &lt;https://github.com/LecrisUT&gt;`_ in `#986 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/986&gt;`_ and `#938 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/938&gt;`_.Miscellaneous-------------* Docs improvements in `#979 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/979&gt;`_.Scikit-build 0.17.5===================A small fix release fixing the passing on of generator specific arguments. Thisfixes some cases where the Ninja generator was found but then was unable tobuild. NetBSD was reported to work, so was added to the BSD's supported.Bug fixes---------* Generator args were missing for actual compile in `#975 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/975&gt;`_.* Add support for netbsd &amp; pyodide (future) in `#977 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/977&gt;`_.Scikit-build 0.17.4===================A followup fix to the issue 0.17.3 tried to fix. We now have a method tomanually test downstream packages, too.Bug fixes---------* Make sure include dir is found even if the lib is not present in `#974 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/974&gt;`_.Scikit-build 0.17.3===================A small release related to ``PYTHON_LIBRARY`` handling changes in 0.17.2;scikit-build 0.17.3 returns an empty string from ``get_python_library`` if noPython library is present (like on manylinux), where 0.17.2 returned None, andprevious versions returned a non-existent path. Note that adding ``REQUIRED``to ``find_package(PythonLibs`` will fail, but it is incorrect (you must notlink to ``libPython.so``) and was really just injecting a non-existent pathbefore.Bug fixes---------* Keep ``get_python_library``  return type string if python lib non-existing  for now in `#959 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/959&gt;`_.* Avoid 'not found' warning if libs are not found by FindPythonExtensions in `#960 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/960&gt;`_.* FindNumPy should not call FindPythonLibs in `#958 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/958&gt;`_.Scikit-build 0.17.2===================Another small release with fixes for non-MSVC Windows platforms.Bug fixes---------* RPM spec fix by `@LecrisUT &lt;https://github.com/LecrisUT&gt;`_ in `#937 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/937&gt;`_.* Validate value before returning library path by `@dlech &lt;https://github.com/dlech&gt;`_ in `#942 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/942&gt;`_.* Only add ``Python_LIBRARY`` on Windows MSVC in `#943 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/943&gt;`_ and `#944 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/944&gt;`_.* Slightly nicer traceback for failed compiler in `#947 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/947&gt;`_.Testing-------* Hide a few warnings that are expected in `#948 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/948&gt;`_.Scikit-build 0.17.1===================This is a small release fixing a few bugs; the primary one being a change thatwas triggering a bug in older FindPython. The unused variable messages havebeen deactivated to simplify output, as well.Bug fixes---------* Older (&lt;3.24) CMake breaks when lib specified in `#932 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/932&gt;`_.* An error output was missing formatting in `#931 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/931&gt;`_.* Make empty ``CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`` a warning (bug in conda-forge's  clang activation fixed upstream) in `#934 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/934&gt;`_.* Remove unused variable warnings by in `#930 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/930&gt;`_.Testing-------* Add Fedora packaging with packit automation by `@LecrisUT &lt;https://github.com/LecrisUT&gt;`_ in `#928 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/928&gt;`_.* Fix codecov ci by `@LecrisUT &lt;https://github.com/LecrisUT&gt;`_ in `#929 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/929&gt;`_.* Update some coverage settings in `#933 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/933&gt;`_.Scikit-build 0.17.0===================A lot of bug fixes are present in this release, focusing on Windows, PyPy, andcross compiling. We've also improved the compatibility with default setuptoolsbehaviors a little, and enabled some things that were previously unavailable,like overriding the build type via the cmake argument environment variables.We've expanded our CI matrix to include Windows and macOS PyPy and some Fortrantests on Linux. This release requires Python 3.7+.Bug fixes---------* Match setuptools behavior for ``include_package_data`` default. by `@vyasr &lt;https://github.com/vyasr&gt;`_ in `#873 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/873&gt;`_.* Misc. fixes for F2PY and PythonExtensions modules by `@benbovy &lt;https://github.com/benbovy&gt;`_ in `#495 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/495&gt;`_.* Provide more useful error if user provides ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` by `@vyasr &lt;https://github.com/vyasr&gt;`_ in `#872 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/872&gt;`_.* Stop assuming that ``.pyx`` files are in the same directory as ``CMakeLists.txt`` by `@vyasr &lt;https://github.com/vyasr&gt;`_ in `#871 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/871&gt;`_.* Allow build type overriding in `#902 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/902&gt;`_.* Detect PyPy library correctly on Windows by user:`gershnik` in `#904 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/904&gt;`_.* Include library for FindPython for better Windows cross-compiles in `#913 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/913&gt;`_.

Building Binary Extensions with pybind11, scikit-build, and cibuildwheel. https://doi.org/10.25080/majora-212e5952-033History-------PyCMake was created at SciPy 2014 in response to general difficulties buildingC++ and Fortran based Python extensions across platforms.  It was renamed to&quot;scikit-build&quot; in 2016. Scikit-build-core was started in 2022.Known Issues------------These issues are likely to be addressed in upcoming releases, and arealready addressed in `scikit-build-core`_.* Editable installs do not work with the latest versions of Setuptools (and had  issues with older versions, too).* Configuration scikit-build cares about _must_ be specified in ``setup()``  currently.* The cache directory (``_skbuild``) may need to be deleted between builds in  some cases (like rebuilding with a different Python interpreter).* AIX requires a newer version of CMake than the IBM-supplied CMake 3.22.0  from the AIX Toolbox for Open Source Software.  We currently recommend  building CMake from source on AIX.We are also working on improving scikit-build, so there are some upcomingchanges and deprecations:* All deprecated setuptools/distutils features are also deprecated in  scikit-build, like the ``test`` command, ``easy_install``, etc.* Older versions of CMake (&lt;3.15) are not recommended; a future version will  remove support for older CMake's (along with providing a better mechanism for  ensuring a proper CMake is available).If you need any of these features, please open or find an issue explaining whatand why you need something.Miscellaneous-------------* Free software: MIT license* Documentation: http://scikit-build.readthedocs.org* Source code: https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build* Discussions: https://github.com/orgs/scikit-build/discussions* Scikit-build-core: https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build-coreSupport for this work was provided by NSF cooperative agreement `OAC-2209877 &lt;https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2209877&gt;`_... _scikit-build-core: https://scikit-build-core.readthedocs.io.. _cmake: https://cmake.org</longdescription>

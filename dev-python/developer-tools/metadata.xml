	<longdescription>developer-tools===============Useful tools for Python developers.This is mostly an example to show how `autopip &lt;https://pypi.org/project/autopip/&gt;`_ can be used to install a group ofapps with various version specifications, but the author does install it as it conveniently provides all the toolsuseful for doing Python software development.To tell `autopip` to install other apps, simply add an `autopip` entry point group in ``setup.py`` with the list ofapps and versions. Versions can be pinned to major or a specific version, or use `latest` to install the latest version.Update frequency can also be specified per app. See working example of `autopip` entry point groupin `developer-tools' setup.py &lt;https://github.com/maxzheng/developer-tools/blob/master/setup.py#L27&gt;`_::    entry_points={        'autopip': [            'ansible = 2.5.4',                 # Pin to specific version without auto-update (recommended for 3rd party)            'ansible-hostmanager = latest',    # Install latest and update hourly (for apps that you own)            'awscli = 1.15 [monthly]',         # Pin to minor and update monthly            'flake8 = 3 [weekly]',             # Pin to major and update weekly            'twine = 1 [weekly]',            'rstcheck = 3.0.1',            'workspace-tools = latest',        ],    },For better security and user experience, it is recommended to pin to a specific version -- at least minor -- for 3rdparty apps. For apps that you own where you have good versioning in the app, then `latest` works better to let the appcontrol its own release.Seeing is believing, so try installing it::    autopip install developer-toolsWhich should output something like the following -- line 3 is the interesting part::    Installing developer-tools to /home/mzheng/.apps/developer-tools/0.0.3    Hourly auto-update enabled via cron service    This app has defined &quot;autopip&quot; entry points to install: ansible==2.5.4 ... twine==1.* workspace-tools    Installing ansible to /home/mzheng/.apps/ansible/2.5.4    Updating script symlinks in /home/mzheng/.apps/bin    + ansible    ...    ...

There are two main benefits it seeks to provide:1. Automate tedious calculations/remembering small details.  For example,    calculating how to setup master mixes, remembering which antibiotics to use    with which plasmids, adding fragments to a DNA assembly reaction in the    ideal molar ratios, choosing annealing temperatures and extension times for    PCR reactions, etc.  Stepwise can automatically work out all of these    details and many more like them.2. Record every step of every experiment.  We all know that we should keep    careful notes of everything we do in lab, but having to repeatedly write    down similar details for similar experiments is tedious and prone to    ambiguities or inconsistencies.  Stepwise helps by filling in all the little    details after you specify the few important ones.**Warning: this software is still very much a work in progress!**If stepwise seems like it might be useful to you, I'd encourage you to give it a try!  I use it every day, and it's certainly functional.  However, it's not yet finished, and it's certainly not yet polished.  Let me know (preferably by opening an issue in the `bug tracker`_) if you have a hard time understanding how anything is supposed to work, or if you encounter a cryptic error message, or anything like that.  I ultimately want to make this into a broadly useful tool for as many scientists as possible, and getting feedback from other people will really help with that.Example=======An example makes the benefits mentioned above more clear.  Here's the command for a protocol to construct two plasmids, named &quot;p216&quot; and &quot;p217&quot;::  $ sw make p216 p217This protocol needs to know what these plasmids are, and you would provide that information via an Excel spreadsheet or similar; see FreezerBox_ for more info.  Below are some of the relevant entries from this spreadsheet:Plasmids and fragments:====  =====  ====================================  ==================================Name  Ready  Synthesis                             Cleanup====  =====  ====================================  ==================================p216      n  gibson f169,f172                      transform; sequence o266; miniprepp217      n  gibson f169,f173                      transform; sequence o266; miniprepf169      n  pcr template=p186 primers=o359,sr71   spin-cleanupf172      y  order vendor=IDTf173      y  order vendor=IDT====  =====  ====================================  ==================================Oligos:====  ====================Name  Sequence====  ====================o359  CAACATTTCCGTGTCGCCCTsr71  CCGGTTGTACCTATCGAGTG====  ====================Briefly, these tables describe how to make each construct.  For example, p216 is made by doing a Gibson assembly with fragments f169 and f172.  In turn, f169 is made by doing PCR with p186 as a template and o359 and sr71 as primers.  From just the names of the constructs to make, the information in these spreadsheets, and sequence information read from SnapGene or GenBank files, stepwise produces the following protocol::  $ sw make p216 p217   1.

Notes:  [1] For resuspending lyophilized primers:      100 µM = 10 µL/nmol    [2] https://tinyurl.com/y27ralt4    [3] For diluting template DNA to 20 pg/µL:      Dilute 1 µL twice into 7*sqrt([DNA]) µL    [4] https://tinyurl.com/xr8ruvr9    [5] Column capacity: 10 µg    [6] https://tinyurl.com/ychbvkra    [7] https://tinyurl.com/2cesd2hvNote that we only had to specify the really meaningful details, like which constructs to make, which templates/primers to use for PCR, etc.  Stepwise figured out everything else automatically, including:- Realizing that f169 needs to be made before p216 or p217.- Realizing that f172 and f173 *don't* need to be made, because they are marked   as &quot;ready&quot;.- Choosing all of the PCR parameters, including volumes for every reagent and a   temperatures/times for every thermocycler step.  Q5 polymerase is used in   this example because that is what I order, but it easy to configure other   vendors/mixes.  The annealing temperature and extension times are based on   the sequences of the template and the primers.- Realizing that both assemblies share the f169 fragment, and so it can be   included in a master mix.- Estimating the concentration of the f169 fragment based on the typical yield   from a PCR reaction and the typical recovery from a silica spin column.- Choosing all of the Gibson assembly parameters, most notably fragment volumes   that give the recommended molar ratio of backbone to insert.  - Which antibiotics to use when transforming the plasmids.  This comes from   searching the sequence of the plasmids for known antibiotic resistance genes.Installation============Install stepwise from ``pip``::  $ pip install stepwiseYou may also want to install some related packages.  First is `Stepwise — Molecular Biology &lt;swmb&gt;`_, which is a collection of pre-programmed protocols relating to molecular biology, e.g. PCR, Gibson/Golden Gate assembly, in vitro transcription, etc.::  $ pip install stepwise_mol_bioSecond is FreezerBox_, which allows you to record useful information about your DNA/protein constructs (e.g. sequence, molecular weight, cloning strategy, etc.) in a way that is accessible to stepwise::  $ pip install freezerboxGetting started===============Stepwise aims to be something you can use for every single protocol you perform.  However, that's a big commitment.  It's easier to get started by just using stepwise for a few tasks that it really excels at:- ``sw make``: See the example above.  This command is great for routine   cloning.  The basic workflow is to record your cloning steps in a spreadsheet   as you plan them, then to have stepwise generate a protocol once all of your   primers etc. have arrived.  Requires `FreezerBox`_.- ``sw future/reactions``: This command calculates the best way to use master   mixes to setup groups of related reactions.  It really shows its worth in   complex situations that call for 3-4 master mixes.  It knows how to make a   little bit extra of each mix, and can account for all sorts of complicated   reaction setups.Quick hint: There isn't yet any online documentation for stepwise, but each command has pretty extensive usage information if you use the ``-h`` flag.  For example::  $ sw future/reactions -h.. _`bug tracker`: https://github.com/kalekundert/stepwise/issues.. _FreezerBox: https://github.com/kalekundert/freezerbox.. _swmb: https://github.com/kalekundert/stepwise_mol_bio</longdescription>

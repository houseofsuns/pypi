You can install it locally and run the bot through the command line interface.Documentation: https://pyup.io/docs/Installation------------To install pyup, run::    $ pip install pyupioIf you want to update Pipfiles, install the optional pipenv extra:    $ pip install dparse[pipenv]Obtain Token------------In order to communicate with the github API, you need to create an oauth token for your account:* Log in to your github account* Click on settings -&gt; Personal access tokens* Click on Generate new token* Make sure to check `repo` and `email` and click on Generate tokenRun your first Update---------------------Run::    $ pyup --repo=username/repo --user-token=&lt;YOUR_TOKEN&gt; --initialThis will check all your requirement files and search for new package versions. If there areupdates available, pyup will create a new branch on your repository and create a new commit forevery single update. Once all files are up to date, pyup will create a single pull request containingall commits.Once your repository is up to date and the initial update is merged in, remove the `--initial`flag and run::    $ pyup --repo=username/repo --user-token=&lt;YOUR_TOKEN&gt;This will create a new branch and a pull request for every single update. Run a cronjob or a scheduled task somewherethat auto-updates your repository once in a while (e.g. every day) to stay on latest.Pyup also has experimental support for Gitlab.  Generate a personal access tokenfrom your profile settings (eg. https://gitlab.com/profile/personal_access_tokens),then run pyup from the cli::    # gitlab.com:    $ pyup --provider gitlab --repo=username/repo --user-token=&lt;YOUR_TOKEN&gt;Custom Gitlab instance and GitHub Enterprise support----------------------------------------------------Pyup offer support for custom Gitlab instances and GitHub Enterprise via the provider_url option::    $ pyup --provider github --provider_url https://github.enterprise/api/v3 --repo=username/repo --user-token=&lt;YOUR_TOKEN&gt;    $ pyup --provider gitlab --provider_url https://your.gitlab/ --repo=username/repo --user-token=&lt;YOUR_TOKEN&gt;    # The alternative method to add a custom gitlab instance is still valid :    $ pyup --provider gitlab --repo=username/repo --user-token=&lt;YOUR_TOKEN&gt;@https://your.gitlab/Disable verification of SSL certificate::    $ pyup --provider github --provider_url https://github.enterprise/api/v3 --repo=username/repo --user-token=&lt;YOUR_TOKEN&gt; --ignore_ssl    $ pyup --provider gitlab --repo=username/repo --user-token=&lt;YOUR_TOKEN&gt;@https://your.gitlab/ --ignore_sslPython 2.7----------This tool requires latest Python patch versions starting with version 3.5. Wedid support Python 2.7 in the past but, as for other Python 3.x minor versions,it reached its End-Of-Life and as such we are not able to support it anymore.We understand you might still have Python 2.7 projects running. At the sametime, PyUp itself has a commitment to encourage developers to keep theirsoftware up-to-date, and it would not make sense for us to work with officiallyunsupported Python versions, or even those that reached their end of life.If you still need to run PyUp from a Python 2.7 environment, please useversion 1.0.2 available at PyPi. Alternatively, you can run PyUp from aPython 3 environment to check the requirements file for your Python 2.7project.History-------1.1.2 (2021-02-19)-------------------* Schedule wont break config reading if it is not a string* New feature `#274`_ allows customizing commit messages* Fixed `#384`_ affecting GitLab automatic merge.. _#274: https://github.com/pyupio/pyup/issues/274.. _#384: https://github.com/pyupio/pyup/issues/3841.1.1 (2020-05-01)------------------* Fixed package Python requirement metadata to Python 3.5+* Added an option to ignore SSL certificate* GitLab integration minor fixes* Upgraded Dparse and Safety requirement* Fixed `#343`_ affecting Cookiecutter projects* Fixed `#348`_ affecting GitLab branch removal.. _#343: https://github.com/pyupio/pyup/issues/343.. _#348: https://github.com/pyupio/pyup/pull/3481.1.0 (2020-3-14)-----------------This version does not contain, as it was supposed to, the metadata settingminimum Python requirement to 3.5.

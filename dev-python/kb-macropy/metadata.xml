	<longdescription># MacropyKeyboard listener, hotkey manager, word expander, task automation, and more!![Terminal Output](https://github.com/Ryen-042/Macropy/blob/main/Images/Output.png?raw=true)## Big Update - CythonCython is used to compile python source code and make it faster. Cython creates `.c` files that can be compiled into python binary extension modules.The `macropy/cython_extensions` directory contains all the Cython code for all the script modules. For each module, there are two files:- `xxx.pyx`: Python source code written in Cython, which can later be compiled into a `.c` file.- `xxx.c`: The compiled version of the Cython extension module, which can later be compiled into `.pyd` binary source files.The actual files that are imported and used are the `.pyd` files. I have uploaded the `.c` files that were generated with Cython, so it is not necessary to have Cython to recompile the existing extension modules. To build the Cython extensions, run:    python setup.py build_ext --inplaceBy default, `setup.py` builds the extension from the `.pyx` files and falls back to the `.c` files if Cython is not installed. If you wish to build using the `.c` files (for example, to ensure that the build doesn't fail due to particular Cython version issues), you must set `USE_CYTHON=False` in `setup.py`.To use this script, you can pip install it as follows:    pip install kb_macropyNote that the package name for download is kb_macropy. However, to start the script, run `macropy`.You can also clone this repository and simply run the `__main__.py` file, or install it by running:    python setup.py install## Why did I write this script?A lot of times I found myself repeating one or more tasks. Some of these tasks are tedious and may be performed more than one time a day. Other tasks may be faster if they are performed without interacting with GUI elements. Combine all this with my low-performance laptop and you can see why I have written this script.## DescriptionThis script can be described as a keyboard listener. However, unlike normal keyboard listeners provided by existing modules like `keyboard`, `pynput`, etc., this script has two huge advantages. The first is the ability to use any key combination for triggering a hotkey, and multiple key combinations can be specified easily to trigger the same hotkey. The second advantage is the ability to use any keyboard keys (even keys like `FN`) as long as the key is reported by the os.This script relies heavily on windows API and focuses on tasks that involve windows explorer. These tasks are triggered by a hotkey. There is also support for word expansion where you type a colon followed by an abbreviation, and a substitution will be added accordingly.## Features&lt;ins&gt;Below are some of the windows explorer operations that the script can perform&lt;/ins&gt;:- Creating a new file -&gt; `Ctrl + Shift + ['m' or 'M']`.![Creating A New File](https://github.com/Ryen-042/Macropy/blob/main/Images/New_File.gif?raw=true)- Copying the full path to the selected files in the active explorer/desktop window -&gt; `Shift + F2`.- Merging the selected images from the active explorer window into a PDF file -&gt; `Ctrl + Shift + ['p' or 'P']`.![Merging Images Into PDF](https://github.com/Ryen-042/Macropy/blob/main/Images/Merging_Images_To_PDF.gif?raw=true)- Converting the selected word files from the active explorer window into PDF files -&gt; `Backtick + ['o' or 'O']`.- Converting the selected powerpoint files from the active explorer window into PDF files -&gt; `Backtick + ['p' or 'P']`.![Converting Powerpoint Files To PDF](https://github.com/Ryen-042/Macropy/blob/main/Images/Converting_Powerpoint_To_PDF.gif?raw=true)- Reopening closed file explorer windows (currently only keeps track of closed explorers by `Alt + F4` or `Ctrl + W`).![Reopening Closed Explorer](https://github.com/Ryen-042/Macropy/blob/main/Images/Reopening_Closed_Explorer.gif?raw=true)- Converting `.mp3` audio files into `.wav` files.- Flattening directories by moving all the files/folders inside to the same level.&lt;ins&gt;Next are some of the supported window manipulation operations&lt;/ins&gt;:- Moving the window around (up, right, down, right) -&gt; `Backtick + (↑ or → or ↓ or ←)`.![Moving Window Around](https://github.com/Ryen-042/Macropy/blob/main/Images/Moving_Window.gif?raw=true)- Making the window always on top -&gt; `FN + Ctrl + ['a', 'A']`.- Decreasing/increasing the opacity of a window -&gt; `Backtick + (['+', '='] or ['-', '_'])`.![Changing Opacity](https://github.com/Ryen-042/Macropy/blob/main/Images/Changing_Opacity.gif?raw=true)&lt;ins&gt;Next are some of the supported system manipulation operations&lt;/ins&gt;:- Putting the device into sleep mode -&gt; `Win + FN + Ctrl + ['s', 'S']`.- Shutting down the system -&gt; `Win + FN + Ctrl + ['q', 'Q']`.- Increasing/Decreasing the system volume -&gt; `Ctrl + Shift + (['=', '+'] Or  ['-', '_'])`.- Increasing/Decreasing brightness -&gt; `Backtick + ('F2' Or  'F3')`.- Sending hotkeys and keyboard key sequences.- Scrolling up/down (by sending mouse wheel scrolls) -&gt; While ScrLck is active: `W or A or S or D`.&lt;ins&gt;Next are some of the supported text expansion operations&lt;/ins&gt;:- Expanding text (e.g., try pressing the next keys -&gt; `:name`).![Text Expansion](https://github.com/Ryen-042/Macropy/blob/main/Images/Expanding_Text.gif?raw=true)- Opening a file or a folder (e.g., try pressing the next keys -&gt; `!paint`).![Opening Paint](https://github.com/Ryen-042/Macropy/blob/main/Images/Opening_Paint.gif?raw=true)## Extra- The script does not receive keyboard events when the active process is elevated. A notification message will be printed every 10 seconds with a sound when this happens. You can run the script with elevated privileges to receive keyboard events in this scenario.![Elevated Process Checker](https://github.com/Ryen-042/Macropy/blob/main/Images/Elevated_Checker.png?raw=true)- To terminate the script, press the hotkey -&gt; `FN + ESC`.- To make sure the script is running (by displaying a toast notification), press the hotkey -&gt; `FN + /`.- To clear the terminal, press the hotkey -&gt; `Ctrl + FN + C`.- To suppress/silence the terminal output, press the hotkey -&gt; `FN + Alt + S`.- To suppress keyboard keys (hotkeys still work), press the hotkey -&gt; `Ctrl + Alt + D`.- The script will not allow more than one active instance at a time.</longdescription>

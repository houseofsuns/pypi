	<longdescription># B.AwsTestingFrameworkA python based AWS infrastructure testing micro-framework.&lt;br&gt;It supports multiple IAC tools like AWS CDK and AWS CloudFormation.### DescriptionCreating infrastructure in AWS is quite hard. There are many nuances,pitfalls and &quot;gotchas&quot; that sometimes are awfully frustrating. Often some IAC code changes might result in some unexpected infrastructure changes.That is why the created infrastructure should have automated integration tests. This python based framework provides you basic functionality to help youwrite unit ant integration tests to test AWS infrastructure createdvia UI or via tools like AWS CDK. The framework is based on pytest - a python based testing library. With thatsaid, all pytest functionality and configs can be applied on this framework too.The framework is easy to use with explicit examples for each IAC tool. Go toexamples section and find which example suits you the most.### Remarks[Biomapas](https://biomapas.com) aims to modernise life-science industry by sharing its IT knowledge with other companies and the community. This is an open source library intended to be used by anyone. Improvements and pull requests are welcome.### Related technology- Python 3- Pytest- AWS CDK- AWS CloudFormation### AssumptionsThe project assumes the following:- You have basic-good knowledge in python programming.- You have basic-good knowledge in AWS.- You have basic knowledge in testing.### Useful sources- Read more about pytest:&lt;br&gt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/### InstallThe project is built and uploaded to PyPi. Install it by using pip.```pip install b_aws_testing_framework```Or directly install it through source.```pip install .```### Usage &amp; ExamplesThe framework uses flexible credentials management. You can eitherset credentials in the constructor:```pythonfrom b_aws_testing_framework.credentials import CredentialsCredentials(    aws_access_key_id='key',    aws_secret_access_key='secret',    region_name='region')```Or you can set the environment:```set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=keyset AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=keyset AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=region```And then in your python program:```pythonfrom b_aws_testing_framework.credentials import CredentialsCredentials()```After setting the credentials you can set a `global prefix`. Global prefixis a globally accessible peace of string that can be used when naming AWS resources. This is extremely useful when running tests in CI/CD pipelineswhere we can have more than one parallel pipeline running. To access andmanage a global prefix, import your testing manager and use these commands:```python# Set a random string.TestingManager.set_global_prefix()# Create a resource with a unique name. E.g.CdkStack(    scope=scope,    id=f'{TestingManager.get_global_prefix()}TestingStackId',    stack_name=f'{TestingManager.get_global_prefix()}TestingStackName')```See the specific examples for specific tools:- [Testing AWS CDK based projects](https://github.com/Biomapas/B.AwsTestingFramework/blob/master/documentation/example-cdk.md)- [Testing CloudFormation based projects](https://github.com/Biomapas/B.AwsTestingFramework/blob/master/documentation/example-cf.md)### TestingThe project has tests that can be run. Note, that tests are integration tests inherently because theytest how resources are created in AWS environment. Since resources are created and tested in AWS you are subject for all the applicablecharges while tests are being run.#### Setting environmentBefore running tests set environment variables:- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY- AWS_DEFAULT_REGIONOr:- AWS_PROFILE- AWS_DEFAULT_REGION#### Running testsThen run tests from a root directory with `pytest` python testing library.Testing *CloudFormation* functionality:```pytest b_aws_testing_framework_test/tools/testing_with_cf```Testing *Cloud Development Kit* functionality:```pytest b_aws_testing_framework_test/tools/testing_with_cdk```Note that integration tests usually take a while to complete (from 5 to 30minutes on average).### ContributionFound a bug?

Code for a very simple lambda used in the tests is reproduced below... code:: python  config = {      'function_name': 'my_test_function',      'function_module': 'service',      'function_handler': 'handler',      'handler': 'service.handler',      'region': 'us-east-1',      'runtime': 'python3.6',      'role': 'helloworld',      'description': 'Test lambda'  }  def handler(event, context):      return 'Hello! My input event is %s' % eventThis code illustrates the two things required to create a lambda. The first is ``config``, which specifies metadata for AWS. One important thing to note in here is the ``role`` field. This must be a IAM role with Lambda permissions - the one in this example is ours. The second is the ``handler`` function. This is the actual code that is executed.Given this code in ``example_function.py`` you would deploy this function like so:.. code:: python  from aws_lambda import deploy_function  import example_function  deploy_function(example_function,                  function_name_suffix='&lt;suffix&gt;',                  package_objects=['list', 'of', 'local', 'modules'],                  requirements_fpath='path/to/requirements',                  extra_config={'optional_arguments_for': 'boto3'})And that's it! You've deployed a simple lambda function. You can navigate to the AWS console to create a test event to trigger it or you can invoke it directly using Boto3.Advanced Usage==============Many of the options specified in the above code block when it came to actually deploying the function are not used. These become more useful as you want to make more complicated lambda functions. The ideal way to incorporate dependencies into lambda functions is by providing a ``requirements.txt`` file. We rely on ``pip`` to install these packages and have found it to be very reliable. While it is also possible to specify local modules as well through ``package_objects``, doing so is not recommended because those modules must be specified at the top level of the repository in order to work out of the box. There is a comment on this topic in ``example_function_package.py`` with code on how to handle it.Tests========Tests can be found in the ``test_aws_lambda.py``. Using the tests as a guide to develop your lambdas is probably a good idea. You can also see how to invoke the lambdas directly from Python (and interpret the response).</longdescription>

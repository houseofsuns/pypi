Added methods in this class.What's new in version 3.0.2 ?    - Corrected several mistakes in class MrFixSQLWhat's new in version 3.0.1 ?    - Added classes MrFixSQL and MrFixAPI. Added methods in these classes.General information The Mr Fix module is designed to create autotests written in Python for testing UI, API and PostgreSQL.Mr Fix is a module with a set of decorators methods for writing autotests for frontend and backend. It contains all the basic methods needed to write UI-, API- and SQL-autotests. It is an open source product. It is distributed on the terms of free software (i.e. it allows you to legally use it, including on commercial projects). Supports the principle of &quot;all in one and in one place&quot;. Allows a beginner (and not just a beginner) specialist in quality control automation not to search for a solution through various manuals and websites, but to immediately find it and use proven methods of work in the MrFix module.The advantages of the module are also:    • reducing the amount of code when using methods of  module;        • a great concentration of the autotester on the correct implementation of the autotest logic, and not on the technical part of autotest;        • the uniformity of the approach of all methods to the form of organization of input data, which simplifies the memorization and application of methods of module    Link of source code:https://github.com/MrFix-Autotesting-Framework/MrFix-Autotesting-FrameworkATTENTION! You can check the security of using the MrFix module on this website:  https://app.snyk.io/advisor/python/mrfixAll methods are static (@staticmethod)If there is a variable &quot;driver&quot; in the method, it is a variable of the Selenium Webdriver type.

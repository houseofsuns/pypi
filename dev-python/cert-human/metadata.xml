So I obviously had to chime in.No, but seriously, I was in the midst of rewriting [another project of mine](https://github.com/tanium/pytan), and I wanted to incorporate a method to get an SSL certificate from a server, show the user the same kind of information as you'd see in a browser, prompt them for validity, then write it to disk for use in all [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) to a server.I was unable to find any great / easy ways that incorporated all of these concepts into one neat thing. So I made a thing.Originally this was based off of yet another lovely over-engineered solution in [get-ca-py](https://github.com/neozenith/get-ca-py) by [Josh Peak](https://github.com/neozenith).Installation------------To install Cert Human, use pip / pipenv:``` {.sourceCode .bash}$ pip install cert_human```Documentation-------------Available [here](https://cert-human.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)</longdescription>

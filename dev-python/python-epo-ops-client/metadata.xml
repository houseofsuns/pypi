If`response.status_code != 200` then a `requests.HTTPError` exception will beraised — it's your responsibility to handle those exceptions if you want to. Theone case that's handled is when the access token has expired: in this case, theclient will automatically handle the HTTP 400 status and renew the token.Note that the Client does not attempt to interpret the data supplied by OPS, soit's your responsibility to parse the XML or JSON payload for your own purpose.The following custom exceptions are raised for cases when OPS quotas areexceeded, they are all in the `epo_ops.exceptions` module and are subclasses of`requests.HTTPError`, and therefore offer the same behaviors:- IndividualQuotaPerHourExceeded- RegisteredQuotaPerWeekExceededAgain, it's up to you to parse the response and decide what to do.Currently the Client knows how to issue request for the following services:| Client method                                                                 | API end point         | throttle  || ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------- || `family(reference_type, input, endpoint=None, constituents=None)`             | family                | inpadoc   || `image(path, range=1, extension='tiff')`                                      | published-data/images | images    || `number(reference_type, input, output_format)`                                | number-service        | other     || `published_data(reference_type, input, endpoint='biblio', constituents=None)` | published-data        | retrieval || `published_data_search(cql, range_begin=1, range_end=25, constituents=None)`  | published-data/search | search    || `register(reference_type, input, constituents=['biblio'])`                    | register              | other     || `register_search(cql, range_begin=1, range_end=25)`                           | register/search       | other     || `register_search(cql, range_begin=1, range_end=25)`                           | register/search       | other     |Bulk operations can be achieved by passing a list of valid models to thepublished_data input field.See the [OPS guide][] or use the [Developer's Area][] for more information onhow to use each service.Please submit pull requests for the following services by enhancing the`epo_ops.api.Client` class:- Legal service### MiddlewareAll requests and responses are passed through each middleware object listed in`client.middlewares`. Requests are processed in the order listed, and responsesare processed in the _reverse_ order.Each middleware should subclass `middlewares.Middleware` and implement the`process_request` and `process_response` methods.There are two middleware classes out of the box: Throttler and Dogpile.Throttler is in charge of the OPS throttling rules and will delay requestsaccordingly. Dogpile is an optional cache which will cache all HTTP status 200,404, 405, and 413 responses.By default, only the Throttler middleware is enabled, if you want to enablecaching:```pythonimport epo_opsmiddlewares = [    epo_ops.middlewares.Dogpile(),    epo_ops.middlewares.Throttler(),]client = epo_ops.Client(    key='key',    secret='secret',    middlewares=middlewares,)```You'll also need to install caching dependencies in your projects, such as `pip install dogpile.cache`._Note that caching middleware should be first in most cases._#### DogpileDogpile is based on (surprise) [dogpile.cache][]. By default it is instantiatedwith a DBMBackend region with timeout of 2 weeks.Dogpile takes three optional instantiation parameters:- `region`: You can pass whatever valid [dogpile.cache Region][] you want to  backend the cache- `kwargs_handlers`: A list of keyword argument handlers, which it will use to  process the kwargs passed to the request object in order to extract elements  for generating the cache key. Currently one handler is implemented (and  instantiated by default) to make sure that the range request header is part of  the cache key.- `http_status_codes`: A list of HTTP status codes that you would like to have  cached. By default 200, 404, 405, and 413 responses are cached.**Note**: dogpile.cache is not installed by default, if you want to use it, `pip install dogpile.cache` in your project.#### ThrottlerThrottler contains all the logic for handling different throttling scenarios.Since OPS throttling is based on a one minute rolling window, we must persisthistorical (at least for the past minute) throtting data in order to know whatthe proper request frequency is. Each Throttler must be instantiated with aStorage object.##### StorageThe Storage object is responsible for:1.  Knowing how to update the historical record with each request    (`Storage.update()`), making sure to observe the one minute rolling window    rule.2.  Calculating how long to wait before issuing the next request    (`Storage.delay_for()`).Currently the only Storage backend provided is SQLite, but you can easily writeyour own Storage backend (such as file, Redis, etc.). To use a custom Storagetype, just pass the Storage object when you're instantiating a Throttler object.See `epo_ops.middlewares.throttle.storages.Storage` for more implementationdetails.[apache license]: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0[developer's area]: https://developers.epo.org/ops-v3-2/apis[dogpile.cache region]: http://dogpilecache.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api.html#module-dogpile.cache.region[dogpile.cache]: https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/dogpile.cache[epo]: http://epo.org[ops guide]: http://documents.epo.org/projects/babylon/eponet.nsf/0/F3ECDCC915C9BCD8C1258060003AA712/$File/ops_v3.2_documentation_-_version_1.3.16_en.pdf[ops]: https://www.epo.org/searching-for-patents/data/web-services/ops.html[requests.response]: http://requests.readthedocs.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#request-and-response-objects# Change Log## 4.0.0 (2021-09-19)- Upgrade dependencies- Drop support for Python 2.7 and Python 3.5- Add support for Python 3.9## 3.1.3 (2020-09-23)- Upgrade dependencies## 3.1.2 (2020-07-04)- Upgrade dependencies## 3.1.1 (2019-10-28)- GET instead of POST for family services, thanks to [amotl][].

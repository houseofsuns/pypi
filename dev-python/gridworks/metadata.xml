What does this mean? In today's world, morepower comes from highly variable power sources such as wind and solar. And yet, the numberof electrons going into the grid must match the number coming out. This is where GridWorks comes in.GridWorks technology enables electrical devices with some embedded storage or with flexibility to provide gridbalancing. Furthermore, GridWorks allows these appliances to be more thrifty, using electricity whenit is cheap and green.To learn how using and contributing to GridWorks can support a cost-effective and rapid transition to a sustainable future:- Try some simple [Hello World](https://gridworks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hello-gridworks.html) examples;- Read the [Millinocket Story](https://gridworks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/millinocket-demo.html) to learn how to exploit the synergy between wind power and space heating;- Go through the partner [Millinocket Tutorial](https://gridworks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/millinocket-tutorial.html).## GridWorks SDKs- **gridworks**: [package](https://pypi.org/project/gridworks/) provides basic shared mechanics for communication and GNode structure. It is used as a package in all of our other repos.- **gridworks-atn**: [package](https://pypi.org/project/gridworks-atn/) and associated [documentation](https://gridworks-atn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for the GridWorks Python [AtomicTNodes](https://gridworks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/atomic-t-node.html) SDK. AtomicTNodes are the GridWorks actors that make electrical devices _transactive_. This SDK is a great place to learn about blockchain mechanics, as it introduces some of the simpler structures (NFTs, stateless contracts, and then some simple stateful smart contracts constructed using [beaker](https://github.com/algorand-devrel/beaker) ) required for establishing the link between physical reality on the electric grid and the actors that play their avatars in GridWorks.- **gridworks-marketmaker**: [package](https://pypi.org/project/gridworks-marketmaker/) and associated [documentation](https://gridworks-marketmaker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for our Python [MarketMaker](https://gridworks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/market-maker.html) SDK. GridWorks uses distributed actors to balance the electric grid, and MarketMakers are the actors brokering this grid balancing via the markets they run for energy and balancing services.There are several other open source GridWorks repos to explore on [our github page](https://github.com/thegridelectric),including the code running on the [SCADA systems](https://github.com/thegridelectric/gw-scada-spaceheat-python)that Efficiency Maine is deploying in Millinocket this winter.The [GNodeFactory](https://github.com/thegridelectric/g-node-factory) currently hosts the demo,and does most of the heavy lifting in terms of identity management and authentication in GridWorks. Finally, since the demois a distributed simulation, it needs a method of handling time. That's done by a [TimeCoordinator](https://github.com/thegridelectric/gridworks-timecoordinator) GNode.## Usage`pip install gridworks` to install the foundational package.## RabbitMQ InfrastructureGridWorks uses the `rabbit` subfolder for maintaining dev rabbit brokers as well as their own live rabbit brokers.## ContributingContributions are very welcome.To learn more, see the [Contributor Guide].## LicenseDistributed under the terms of the [MIT license][license],_Gridworks_ is free and open source software.## IssuesIf you encounter any problems,please [file an issue] along with a detailed description.## CreditsThis project was generated from [@cjolowicz]'s [Hypermodern Python Cookiecutter] template.[@cjolowicz]: https://github.com/cjolowicz[pypi]: https://pypi.org/[hypermodern python cookiecutter]: https://github.com/cjolowicz/cookiecutter-hypermodern-python[file an issue]: https://github.com/thegridelectric/gridworks/issues[pip]: https://pip.pypa.io/&lt;!-- github-only --&gt;[license]: https://github.com/thegridelectric/gridworks/blob/main/LICENSE[contributor guide]: https://github.com/thegridelectric/gridworks/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md[command-line reference]: https://gridworks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html</longdescription>

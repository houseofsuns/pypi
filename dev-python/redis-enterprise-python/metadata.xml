	<longdescription>**Redis Enterprise API**# REST API Specifications[¶](#rest-api-specifications &quot;Permalink to this headline&quot;)    ## Key Concepts[¶](#key-concepts &quot;Permalink to this headline&quot;)-----------------------------------------------------------    ### Clusters[¶](#clusters &quot;Permalink to this headline&quot;)Redis Labs clusters are a set of nodes, typically two or more, providing database services. Clusters are inherently multi-tenant, and a single cluster can manage multiple databases accessed through individual endpoints.## Protocol and Headers[¶](#protocol-and-headers &quot;Permalink to this headline&quot;)---------------------------------------------------------------------------### JSON Requests and Responses[¶](#json-requests-and-responses &quot;Permalink to this headline&quot;)The Redis Labs REST API uses the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) for requests and responses.  Some responses may have an empty body, but indicate the response with standard HTTP codes. For more information, see RFC 4627 ([http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt)) and www.json.org.Both requests and responses may include zero or more objects.  In case the request is for a single entity, the response shall return a single JSON object, or none. In case the request if for a list of entities, the response shall return a single JSON array with 0 or more elements.  Requests may be delivered with some JSON object fields missing. In this case, these fields will be assigned default values (often indicating they are not in use).### Request Headers[¶](#request-headers &quot;Permalink to this headline&quot;)The Redis Labs REST API supports the following HTTP headers:| Header | Supported/Required Values ||---|---|| Accept | application/json || Content-Length | Length (in bytes) of request message. || Content-Type | application/json |### Response Headers[¶](#response-headers &quot;Permalink to this headline&quot;)The Redis Labs REST API supports the following HTTP headers:  | Header | Supported/Required Values ||---|---|| Content-Type | application/json || Content-Length | Length (in bytes) of request message. |## API Versions[¶](#api-versions &quot;Permalink to this headline&quot;) -----------------------------------------------------------  All RLEC API operations are versioned, in order to minimize the impact of backwards-incompatible API changes and to coordinate between different versions operating in parallel.  ## Authentication[¶](#authentication &quot;Permalink to this headline&quot;)---------------------------------------------------------------  Authentication to RLEC API occurs via [Basic Auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). Provide your RLEC username and password as the basic auth credentials.  All calls must be made over SSL, to port 9443.  Example Request:  ```bashcurl -u &quot;demo@redislabs.com:password&quot; https://localhost:9443/v1/bdbs ```  ## Common Responses[¶](#common-responses &quot;Permalink to this headline&quot;)-------------------------------------------------------------------  The following are common responses which may be returned in some cases regardless of any specific request.| Response | Condition / Required handling ||---|---|| 503 (Service Unavailable) | Contacted node is currently not a member of any active cluster. || 505 (HTTP Version Not Supported) | An unsupported X-API-Version was used, see API Versions above. |# noqa: E501    </longdescription>

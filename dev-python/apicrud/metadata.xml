The challenge of setting up CI testing and microservice deployment is usually daunting; this repo addresses all of those issues by providing a fully-working example you can set up and start modifying in minutes. No prior experience is required.This is the API back-end and worker, with an _example_ application.### UsageSee the [getting started](docs/content/gettingstarted.md) page, or navigate to [Read the Docs](https://apicrud.readthedocs.io/).### BackgroundThe rise of Docker and Kubernetes starting around 2017 made it possible to set up these production-grade services directly on the laptop of any developer. Only recently have the tools been easier to configure and set up. This framework provides working example code you can use to get started creating your own secure, web-scale services.Implementation/design includes these technologies: [babel](http://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/), [celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/), [CloudFront and S3](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/), [docker](https://www.docker.com/), [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [MapQuest geocoding](https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/open/geocoding-api/), [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/), [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/), [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/), [python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/), [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/), [PyOTP](https://pyauth.github.io/pyotp/), [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/), [react.js](https://reactjs.org/), [react-admin](https://marmelab.com/react-admin), [redis](https://redis.io/), [sqlalchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/), [uWSGI](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).### ContributionsYour pull-requests and bug-reports are welcome here.

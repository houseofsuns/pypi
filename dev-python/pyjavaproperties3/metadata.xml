	<longdescription>================pyjavaproperties3================* Project hosting: &lt;https://github.com/tgates42/pyjavaproperties/&gt;.. contents::About------------------This is a &quot;fork&quot; of the &quot;python replacement for java.util.Properties&quot; recipeon ASPN: &lt;http://code.activestate.com/recipes/496795/&gt; and uploaded by Anand Balachandran Pillai. The project is maintained by Jesse Noller &lt;jnoller@gmail.com&gt;, Anand Pilla&lt;abpillai@gmail.com&gt;.License------------------As with all ASPN recipes not otherwise licensed prior to July 15, 2008 onaspn.activestate.com, the original recipe is under PSF License. For moreinformation, see the ASPN terms of service here:&lt;http://code.activestate.com/help/terms/&gt;While the licensing under the PSF license is sub-optimal, it is what it is. See&lt;http://docs.python.org/license.html&gt; for more information about the PSFlicense.What this is------------------This module is designed to be a python equivalent to the `java.util.Properties &lt;http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html&gt;`_ class. Currently, the basic input/output methods are supported, and there are plans to add the XML input/output methods found in J2SE 5.0.Fundamentally, this module is designed so that users can easily parse and manipulate Java Properties files - that's it. There's a fair number of us pythonistas who work in multi-language shops, and constantly writing your own parsing mechanism is just painful. Not to mention Java guys are notoriously unwilling to use anything which is cross-language for configuration, unlessit's XML, which is a form of self-punishment. :)Plans------------------Here is a rough plan of features:- Keep/maintain blank lines and comments found in the original file- Make the module compatible with the new methods in J2SE 5.0- Switch to/add python property access rather than direct dictionary get/set- Add unit tests- Add unicode support- When-Pigs-Fly: If running within Jython, switch to java.util.Properties  under the hood- Coercion/conversion to python types for values Usage------------------This is the easy part::    from pyjavaproperties3 import Properties    p = Properties()    p.load(open('test2.properties'))    p.list()    print p    print p.items()    print p['name3']    p['name3'] = 'changed = value'    print p['name3']        p['new key'] = 'new value'    p.store(open('test2.properties','w'))See also the Properties.list() method, which will return an iterator over theproperty keysChanges &amp; News--------------0.6:     - Fix license, whitespace.0.4:    - Patch from Pepper Lebeck-Jobe for handling ! style comments.0.3:    - Keys that are added which were not part of the original file      are simply appended to the index. Shenanigans.0.2:    - Added an internal list (self._keyorder) to keep an ordered index of keys      as they are encountered, so the file can we written-back out in the       same order.0.1:    - Initial release/fork.     - Added setup/packaging and doc     - added in {foo} style references for previous properties, thanks to N B      on ASPN.</longdescription>

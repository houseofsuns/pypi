	<longdescription>This script launches a cluster on AWS EC2 instances and starts a Jupyter notebook on them.Please read the [manual](manual.md) for the details of all supported commands.[QuickStartGuide.md](QuickStartGuide.md) offers a guided example to show what `aws-jupyter` can do.`aws-jupyter` is intended as a commandline tool, but you can integrate it toa custom Python script. [module-doc.md](module-doc.md) provides a brief how-to.## InstallPleasure ensure you have Python 3. `aws-jupyter` can be install using `pip`:```pip install aws-jupyter```After the installation, you can try it out using the example launch script:```launch-aws-jupyter```It will create a cluster with 2 spot instances.In addition,we create the EC2 instances using an AMI image that located in the region `us-west-2`.So please make sure that your local environment is set up to use that region(you can run `aws-jupyter config` to verify the setting).After installation, please run `aws-jupyter config` to make sure the configuration is properly set.## UpgradeIn case we change the default AWS region, please upgrade `aws-jupyter` in 3 steps:1. Upgrade the package: `pip install --upgrade aws-jupyter`.2. Create the new key pair in the new AWS region, and modify the &quot;key_name&quot; and &quot;ssh_key&quot; fields ofthe credential file accordingly (read below).3. Switch to default AMI and region: `aws-jupyter config --default-ami --default-region`, and set the credential fileto the location of the new one when prompted.### AWS CredentialThe scripts in this repository requires a `credentials.yml` file in following format:```yamlArbitrary Name:  access_key_id: your_aws_access_key_id  secret_access_key: your_aws_secret_access_key  key_name: your_ec2_key_pair_name  ssh_key: /path/to/the/ec2/key/pair/file```The credential file in the Spark Notebook project can be directly used here.The credential file (or a soft link to it) should be located in the same folder whereyou invoke these scripts (i.e. you should be able to see it using `ls .` command).The credential file must always **stay private** and not be shared. Remember to add`credential.yml` to the `.gitignore` file of your project so that thisfile would not be pushed to GitHub.## UsageRun any script in this directory with `-h` argument will print the help message of the script.### Create a new cluster`aws-jupyter create` creates a cluster on the `m3.xlarge` instance using an AMI based on Ubuntu.If the instance comes with attached SSD, it will be mounted to `/mnt`.#### Example:```bashaws-jupyter create -c 2 --name testing```### Check if a cluster is ready`aws-jupyter check` checks if a cluster is up and running. In addition, it also creates a`neighbors.txt` file which contains the IP addresses of all the instances in the cluster.#### Example```bashaws-jupyter check --name testing```### Terminate a cluster`aws-jupyter terminate` terminates a cluster by stopping and terminating all instancesin this cluster.#### Example```bashaws-jupyter terminate --name testing```### Run a script on a cluster`aws-jupyter run` runs a given script on all instances in the cluster.It starts the script in the background, and redirect the stdout/stderrinto a file on the instances which can be checked later.Thus it terminates does not necessarily mean the script has finshed executing on the cluster.In addition, it only launches the script on all instances, but does _not_ check if the scriptexecutes without error.#### Example```bashaws-jupyter run --script ./script-examples/hello-world.sh```### Send a local directory to the remote instancesSend a local directory to all instances of a cluster.It can be used to, for example, distributing the configuratoin files to all instances.#### Example```bashaws-jupyter send-dir --local ./configs/ --remote ~/remote-configs```## Retrieve files from all instances in a clusterRetrieve files from the same location on all instances of a cluster.It can be used to collect the output of the program from the workers.A local directory for saving the downloaded files should be provided to this script.This script will create a separate sub-directory for each worker and download its filesto this sub-directory.### Example```bashmkdir _resultaws-jupyter retrieve --remote /tmp/std* --local ./_result/```## Install a package on all instancesYou can install any missing packages *after the instances are ready* (i.e. `aws-jupyter check` shows Jupyter notebook URL) by following these step:1. create a script on your local computer, which install the required package. For example, assume we want to install `pandas`,```bash$ echo &quot;pip install pandas&quot; &gt; install-pandas.sh````2. run the script on all instances```bashaws-jupyter run -s install-pandas.sh --output```The `--output` argument ensures that the script will run in foreground, so that you can check if the installation succeed.</longdescription>

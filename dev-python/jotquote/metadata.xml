Addingnew quotes is easy::    $ jotquote add &quot;The larger the island of knowledge, the longer the shoreline of wonder. - James Madison&quot;    1 quote added for total of 639 quotes.Starting the web server~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In some cases, the command-line might be good enough for viewing the quotes in yourcollection, but you can start a web server that will show a quote of the day.The ``jotquote webserver`` command can be used to start the webserver::    $ jotquote webserver    * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5544/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)By default, the web server is only accessible on the system on whichit is running.  But by editing the settings.conf file, the web server can bemade accessible to computers on the network also.  See the section below aboutthe settings.conf file for details.The quote file~~~~~~~~~~~~~~jotquote stores the quotes in a text file that uses a human-friendly syntaxand can be modified with a plain text editor if necessary.  Quotes are storedin the text file one per line using the syntax:&lt;quote&gt; | &lt;author&gt; | &lt;publication&gt; | &lt;tag1, tag2, etc...&gt;For example:The best way out is always through. | Robert Frost | A Servant to Servants | motivational, poetryYou can find the location of the quote file using the ``jotquote info`` command,and you can change the location by modifying the ``quote_file`` property insettings.conf (see the settings.conf section below).The text file is encoded in UTF-8 to allow the full Unicode character set.Extended functions~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~To help you build your collection, the command-line interface has an extended setof functions including tagging and keyword searching.  Here are a couple of examples.To display a random quote that has the 'motivational' tag, use the command::    $ jotquote random -t motivationalOr to display all quotes that have the word 'Einstein' in the quote, author name,or publication name, use this command::    $ jotquote list -k EinsteinThe help for these extended functions can be accessed with the '-h' argument;for example, to see the help for the jotquote add function, usethe command::    $ jotquote add -hThe settings.conf file~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The behavior of the jotquote command is controlled with the settings.conffile.  This file is always found at ~/.jotquote/settings.conf on Windows, Mac,and Linux.Supported environments~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~jotquote is tested on Python 2.7, and 3.5 through 3.8 on Windows, Mac, and Linux.Cloud storage~~~~~~~~~~~~~If you'd like to make your quotes accessible from multiple computers, you canput your quote file in a cloud storage service such as Dropbox or Google Driveand then configure jotquote on each computer to use the file on your cloudstorage directory.  To do this, edit the settings.conf file and change the``quote_file`` property to the path to the file on your cloud storage drive.Credit~~~~~~This package was inspired by other similar utilities including Ken Arnold's originalUNIX utility ``fortune``.  This package also relies on the Flask and Click packagesby Armin Ronacher.Contributing~~~~~~~~~~~~Contributions are welcome, see CONTRIBUTING.rst for details.</longdescription>

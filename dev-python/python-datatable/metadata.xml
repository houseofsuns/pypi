It is close in spirit to [pandas][] or [SFrame][]; however weput specific emphasis on speed and big data support. As the name suggests, thepackage is closely related to R's [data.table][] and attempts to mimic its corealgorithms and API.Requirements: Python 3.6+ (64 bit) and pip 20.3+.## Project goals`datatable` started in 2017 as a toolkit for performing big data (up to 100GB)operations on a single-node machine, at the maximum speed possible. Suchrequirements are dictated by modern machine-learning applications, which needto process large volumes of data and generate many features in order toachieve the best model accuracy. The first user of `datatable` was[Driverless.ai][].The set of features that we want to implement with `datatable` is at leastthe following:* Column-oriented data storage.* Native-C implementation for all datatypes, including strings. Packages such  as pandas and numpy already do that for numeric columns, but not for  strings.* Support for date-time and categorical types. Object type is also supported,  but promotion into object discouraged.* All types should support null values, with as little overhead as possible.* Data should be stored on disk in the same format as in memory. This will  allow us to memory-map data on disk and work on out-of-memory datasets  transparently.* Work with memory-mapped datasets to avoid loading into memory more data than  necessary for each particular operation.* Fast data reading from CSV and other formats.* Multi-threaded data processing: time-consuming operations should attempt to  utilize all cores for maximum efficiency.* Efficient algorithms for sorting/grouping/joining.* Expressive query syntax (similar to [data.table][]).* Minimal amount of data copying, copy-on-write semantics for shared data.* Use &quot;rowindex&quot; views in filtering/sorting/grouping/joining operators to  avoid unnecessary data copying.* Interoperability with pandas / numpy / pyarrow / pure python: the users  should have the ability to convert to another data-processing framework  with ease.## InstallationOn macOS, Linux and Windows systems installing datatable is as easy as```shpip install datatable```On all other platforms a source distribution will be needed.

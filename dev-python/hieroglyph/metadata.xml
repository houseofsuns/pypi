(Issue #49)* Bug fix: files in ``html_static_dir`` will now override theme files.  (Issue #54)* Added ``slide_title`` configuration setting. (Issue #56)* Added ``slides2`` theme, based on updated Google HTML 5 slide  templates. (Issue #48)* Added more flexible incremental slides using build-item-* classes.* Theme creation documentation (#53)* Section slide CSS updated for printing. (Issue #37)* Handle titles with embedded markup w/ nextslide directive. (#85)* Improved quickstart script0.6.5-----*Release date: 1 March 2014** Revert &quot;Javascript loading is now deferred until the end of the  document.&quot; This caused issues with content in ifnotslides blocks.  (Issue #33)* Fixed an issue with path mangling for generated images (ie, from  blockdiag).* Added support for ``slide_footer`` (Issue #44)* Converted slide condition directive processing to use Docutils  transforms. This allows section headings to appear in tables of  contents correctly. (Issue #25)* Added ``nextslide`` directive for splitting sections.  (Issue #46)* Section classes are now added to the generated slides (Issue #50).0.6---*Release date: 8 August 2013** The ``note`` directive in a slide now shows up as notes in the  presenter console. Thanks, Doug Hellmann!* Javascript loading is now deferred until the end of the document.* Allow projects to specify custom Javascript to be included with  slides.* slides.js now fires an event when the slides are resized.* Support setting default classes on slides in a document.* Added ``appear`` and ``fade-in`` slide classes for alternate  transitions.* Added ``hieroglyph-quickstart`` script.* Added testing framework, initial tests for directives* Fixed bug where content was not removed with autoslides was  disabled* Slides created with the slide directive may omit have only a title,  or only content (Issue #30)* Slide numbering was often incorrect when dealing with multiple slide  levels; this has been correct (Issue #26)* Better page break handling when printing slides (PR #31).

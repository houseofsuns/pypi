Check your MariaDB versionThough AllianceAuth and most of the community plugins available for it work just fine on MariaDB versions in the 10.3 and 10.4range, this plugin requires version 10.5 or greater.For instructions on installing newer versions of MariaDB please refer to their documentation [here](https://mariadb.org/download/?t=repo-config)### 1. Install AppInstall the app into your allianceauth virtual environment via PIP.```bash$ pip install fittings ```### 2. Configure AA settingsConfigure your AA settings (`local.py`) as follows:- Add `'eveuniverse',` and `'fittings',` to `INSTALLED_APPS`- Add these line to the bottom of the settings file to have module name updates### 3. Finalize InstallRun migrations and copy static files. ```bash$ python manage.py migrate$ python manage.py collectstatic```Restart your supervisor tasks.### 4. Populate TypesNow that fittings has transitioned to using [django-eveuniverse](https://gitlab.com/ErikKalkoken/django-eveuniverse) to handle static data this step is optional.You can choose to run the following command to preload the type information for most ships and modules in the game, or you can skip this step and let them be created on an as-needed basis.Keep in mind that running this command will take a while but will save you time later, if you do not run this command adding fits may take some time if they contain new types.```bash$ python manage.py fittings_preload_data```## UpdatingTo update your existing installation of Fittings first enable your virtual environment.Then run the following commands from your allianceauth project directory (the one that contains `manage.py`).```bash$ pip install -U fittings$ python manage.py migrate$ python manage.py collectstatic```Lastly, restart your supervisor tasks.*Note: Be sure to follow any version specific update instructions as well. These instructions can be found on the `Tags` page for this repository.*## SettingsSetting | Default | Description--- | --- | ---`FITTINGS_AADISCORDBOT_INTEGRATION` | `True` | Enables the AADiscordbot cog## PermissionsPermission | Description-- | --`fitting.access_fittings` | This permission gives users access to the plugin.`doctrine.manage` | User can add/delete ship fits and doctrines.## Active Developers* [Col Crunch](http://gitlab.com/colcrunch)* [Crashtec](https://gitlab.com/huideaki)</longdescription>

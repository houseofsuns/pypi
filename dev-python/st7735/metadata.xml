Allows simple drawing on the display without installing a kernel module.Designed specifically to work with a ST7735 based 160x80 pixel TFT SPI display. (Specifically the 0.96&quot; SPI LCD from Pimoroni).## Installing````pip install st7735````See example of usage in the examples folder.# Licensing &amp; HistoryThis library is a modification of a modification of code originally written by Tony DiCola for Adafruit Industries, and modified to work with the ST7735 by Clement Skau.It has been modified by Pimoroni to include support for their 160x80 SPI LCD breakout, and hopefully also generalised enough so that it will support other ST7735-powered displays.## Modifications include:* PIL/Pillow has been removed from the underlying display driver to separate concerns- you should create your own PIL image and display it using `display(image)`* `width`, `height`, `rotation`, `invert`, `offset_left` and `offset_top` parameters can be passed into `__init__` for alternate displays* `Adafruit_GPIO` has been replaced with `RPi.GPIO` and `spidev` to closely align with our other software (IE: Raspberry Pi only)* Test fixtures have been added to keep this library stablePimoroni invests time and resources forking and modifying this open source code, please support Pimoroni and open-source software by purchasing products from us, too!Adafruit invests time and resources providing this open source code, please support Adafruit and open-source hardware by purchasing products from Adafruit!Modified from 'Modified from 'Adafruit Python ILI9341' written by Tony DiCola for Adafruit Industries.' written by Clement Skau.MIT license, all text above must be included in any redistribution1.0.0-----* Rename module from ST7735 to st7735* Port to gpiod/gpiodevice0.0.5-----* Add support for choosing between BGR/RGB displays* Add methods for display power and sleep control0.0.4-post1-----------* Repackage with Markdown README/setup.cfg* Fix `__version__` to 0.0.4* Update dependencies in README0.0.4-----* Depend upon spidev==3.4.0 for stability fixes* Switch from manual data chunking to spidev.xfer3()0.0.3-----* Fixed backlight pin* Added `set_backlight`* Added constants BG_SPI_CS_FRONT and BG_SPI_CS_BACK* Added module `__version__`0.0.2-----* Support for multiple display sizes/orientations0.0.1-----* Initial Release</longdescription>

The `basic_use_of_get_service.py` example is probably the easiest to get started with.  Other examples cover more specific cases and detailed APIs.Note that while this SDK is intended for use with the IBM Data Fabric Orchestrator on IBM Cloud CPDaaS or on-prem CPD instances with the IBM Data Fabric Orchestrator add-on installed, it can also be used when IBM Data Fabric Orchestrator add-on not installed. So the sdk user should always use the high-level `get_service()` function create a DFO service, which will automatically adapt to these senarios. After get the service instance from `get_service()` function, can use or configure the service instance as your needs.For general SDK usage information, please see [this link](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-cloud-sdk-common/blob/main/README.md)## QuestionsIf you are having difficulties using this SDK or have a question about the IBM Cloud services,please ask a question[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=ibm-cloud).## IssuesIf you encounter an issue with the project, you are welcome to submit a[bug report](https://github.ibm.com/IBM-Data-Fabric/dfo-python-sdk.git/issues).Before that, please search for similar issues.

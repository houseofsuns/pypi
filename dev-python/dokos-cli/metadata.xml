	<longdescription># Docli ## 🛠 How the Docli directory worksDocli is a command line utility based on [Frappe Bench](https://github.com/frappe.bench).- Install applications- Manage multiple sites and update Dodock / Dokos applications on [\*nix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like#Definition) (CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu, etc.) for development and production.## 🚀 Dokos project Dokos is a 100% open-source management software that is based on ERPNext.It is distributed under the GPLv3 license.The 100% web architecture of Dokos allows you to use it in a public cloud as well as in a private cloud.You can install it on your own servers.The Dodock framework on which Dokos is installed also allows the installation of other applications. You can thus develop your own customizations, host them on your server and make them evolve in parallel with Dokos, without modifying its source code.## 📚 Use and documentation#### Installation and use 🚧##### 1.

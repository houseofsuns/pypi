	<longdescription># Python SpatiaFi APIPython library for interacting with the SpatiaFi API.Also included is `gdal-auth` which is a CLI tool to help with GCP authentication for GDAL.## Quickstart### Install the Package```shellpip install spatiafi```### Get Authenticated Session```pythonfrom spatiafi import get_sessionsession = get_session()```### Get help with `gdal-auth````shellgdal-auth --help```---## Development### Use a Virtual EnvironmentDevelopment should be done in a virtual environment.It is recommended to use the virtual environment manager built into PyCharm.To create a new virtual environment:  * Open the project in PyCharm and select `File &gt; Settings &gt; Project: spfi-api &gt; Python Interpreter`.  * In the top right corner of the window, click the gear icon and select `Add Interpreter &gt; Add Local Interpreter...`### Mark `src` as a Source RootIn PyCharm, mark the `src` folder as a source root. This will allow you to import modules from the `src` folder without using relative imports.Right-click on the `src` folder and select `Mark Directory as &gt; Sources Root`.### Bootstrap the Development EnvironmentRun `./scripts/bootstrap_dev.sh` to install the package and development dependencies.This will also set up access to our private PyPI server, generate the first `requirements.txt` (if required),and install `pre-commit` hooks.**Protip:** This script can be run at any time if you're afraid you've messed up your environment.### Running the testsTests can be run locally via the `scripts/test.sh` script:```./scripts/test.sh```All additional arguments to that script will be passed to PyTest which allowsyou to do things such as run a single test:```./scripts/test.sh -k test_async_queue```### Manage Dependencies in `setup.cfg`Dependencies are managed in `setup.cfg` using the `install_requires` and `extras_require` sections.To add a new dependency:  1. Install the package in the virtual environment with `pip install &lt;package_name&gt;`  (Hint: use the terminal built in to PyCharm)  2. Run `pip show &lt;package_name&gt;` to get the package name and version  3. Add the package name *and version* to `setup.cfg` in the `install_requires` section.  Use the [compatible release](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#compatible-release) syntax  `package_name ~=version`.**DO NOT** add the package to the `requirements.txt` file. This file is automatically generated by`scripts/gen_requirements.sh`.If the dependency is only needed for development, add it to the `dev` section of `extras_require` in `setup.cfg`.### Building Docker Images Locally**tl;dr:** run `./scripts/build_docker.sh`.We need to inject a GCP access token into the Docker build to access private PyPI packages.This requires using BuildKit (enabled by default in recent versions of Docker), and passing the token as a buildargument.## `pre-commit` HooksThis project uses `pre-commit` to run a series of checks before each git commit.To install the `pre-commit` hooks, run `pre-commit install` in the virtual environment.(This is done automatically by `./scripts/bootstrap_dev.sh`)To format all your code manually, run `pre-commit run --all-files`.**Note:** If your code does not pass the `pre-commit` checks, automatic builds may fail.### Use `pip-sync` to Update DependenciesTo update local dependencies, run `pip-sync` in the virtual environment.This will make sure your virtual environment is in sync with the `requirements.txt` file,including uninstalling any packages that are not in the `requirements.txt` file.### VersionsThe project uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).Package versions are automatically generated from git tags.Create your first tag with `git tag 0.1.0` and push it with `git push --tags`## Installation**tl;dr:** `./scripts/install_package.sh`For development, it is recommended to install the package in editable mode with `pip install -e .[dev]`.</longdescription>

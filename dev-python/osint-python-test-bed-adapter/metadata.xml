	<longdescription># naas-python-kafkaThis is the kafka adapter for Python: it allows you to easily connect Python services to Apache Kafka via Python. The implementation is a wrapper around [Confluent-kafka-python](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-python) - AVRO schema's and messages: both key's and values should have a schema as explained [here](https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/avro-schemas).- Kafka consumer and producer for the test-bed topics.- Management  - Heartbeat (topic: system-heartbeat), so you know which clients are online.  Each time the test-bed-adapter is executed, it starts a heartbeat process to notify  the its activity to other clients.## InstallationYou need to install [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/). To run the examples you will need to install the dependencies specified on the file [requirements.txt](https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/python-test-bed-adapter/blob/master/requirements.txt)For that, run```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```from the project folder.## Examples and usage- url_producer: creates a message with 4 URLs to RSS feeds on the topic ('system_rss_urls')- rss_producer: listens to url messages ('system_rss_urls') and produces RSS messages ('system_rss_urls')- rss_consumer: listens to RSS messages ('system_rss_urls') and prints them to console.</longdescription>

This Agreement is not to be more strongly construed against either party, regardless of who is more responsible for its preparation. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, unlawful, or invalid in any respect, then that provision will be deemed ineffective only to the extent of its illegality or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of that provision or any of the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

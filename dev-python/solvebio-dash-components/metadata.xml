	<longdescription># solvebio-dash-componentsThis package provides the React component suite for SolveBio-specific Dash components## Development### Setup```sh# Install JavaScript dependencies$ npm install# Create Python 2 virtual environment and install Python dependencies$ pipenv --two install --dev# Enter virtual environment$ pipenv shell```Add the following line to your Dash app```app.scripts.config.serve_locally = True```### ComponentsTo install the SolveBio Dash components locally, simply clone the repo to the root folder of yourDash app```sh$ git clone https://github.com/solvebio/solvebio-dash-components.git```Then `cd` into the directory and follow the above setup process.In addition, add the following lines to your Dash app```sys.path.insert(0, 'solvebio-dash-components')import solvebio_dash_components as sdc```#### DashS3UploaderA working example of the DashS3Uploader component can be launched with the following:```sh$ python usage.py$ open http://local.solvebio.com:8050```One thing to note about the DashS3Uploader is that when run locally, it must be run on `local.solvebio.com`for proper function. This is because the CORS configurations have been set on the server sideso as to only allow S3 uploading specifically from the above address.### Code quality and tests#### To run lint and unit tests:```sh$ npm test```#### To run unit tests and watch for changes:```sh$ npm run test-watch```#### To run a specific testIn your test, append `.only` to a `describe` or `it` statement:```javascriptdescribe.only('Foo component', () =&gt; {    // ...});```### Testing your components in Dash1. Build development bundle to `lib/` and watch for changes        # Once this is started, you can just leave it running.        $ npm start2. Install module locally (after every change)        # Generate metadata, and build the JavaScript bundle        $ npm run install-local        # Now you're done. For subsequent changes, if you've got `npm start`        # running in a separate process, it's enough to just do:        $ python setup.py install3. Run Dash file containing your component        $ python usage.py## Installing Python package locallyBefore publishing to PyPi, you can test installing the module locally:```sh# Install in `site-packages` on your machine$ npm run install-local```## Uninstalling Python package locally```sh$ npm run uninstall-local```## PublishingCurrently, separate steps must be taken to publish to NPM and PyPi as this projectis based on the [dash-components-archetype][]. There is ongoing work to simplifythe publishing steps into one workflow [here](https://github.com/plotly/dash-components-archetype/issues/5).1. Publish to NPM        # Prepublish        $ npm run prepublish        # Bump the package version        $ vim package.json                # Create new tag        $ git tag -a vx.x.x -m &quot;tag message&quot;        # Push branch and tags to repo        $ git push origin --tags        # Publish to NPM        $ npm publish2. Publish to PyPi        # Bump the PyPi package to the same version        $ vim solvebio_dash_components/version.py        # Commit to github        $ git add solvebio_dash_components/version.py        $ git commit -m &quot;Bump pypi package version to vx.x.x&quot;                # Create new dist        $ python setup.py sdist        # Publish to PyPi using        $ twine upload dist/solvebio_dash_components-&lt;new_version&gt;.tar.gz## Builder / ArchetypeWe use [Builder][] to centrally manage build configuration, dependencies, andscripts.To see all `builder` scripts available:```sh$ builder help```See the [dash-components-archetype][] repo for more information.[Builder]: https://github.com/FormidableLabs/builder[Dash]: https://plot.ly/dash[NPM package authors]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/dash-core-components/access[PyPi]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi[dash-components-archetype]: https://github.com/plotly/dash-components-archetype</longdescription>

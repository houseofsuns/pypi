	<longdescription>==========abnamrolib==========A library implementing authenticating to an Abn Amro account or ICS credit card and retrieving the transactions* Documentation: https://abnamrolib.readthedocs.org/en/latestDevelopment Workflow====================The workflow supports the following steps * lint * test * build * document * upload * graphThese actions are supported out of the box by the corresponding scripts under _CI/scripts directory with sane defaults based on best practices.Sourcing setup_aliases.ps1 for windows powershell or setup_aliases.sh in bash on Mac or Linux will provide with handy aliases for the shell of all those commands prepended with an underscore.The bootstrap script creates a .venv directory inside the project directory hosting the virtual environment. It uses pipenv for that.It is called by all other scripts before they do anything. So one could simple start by calling _lint and that would set up everything before it tried to actually lint the projectOnce the code is ready to be delivered the _tag script should be called accepting one of three arguments, patch, minor, major following the semantic versioning scheme.So for the initial delivery one would call    $ _tag --minorwhich would bump the version of the project to 0.1.0 tag it in git and do a push and also ask for the change and automagically update HISTORY.rst with the version and the change provided.So the full workflow after git is initialized is: * repeat as necessary (of course it could be test - code - lint :) )   * code   * lint   * test * commit and push * develop more through the code-lint-test cycle * tag (with the appropriate argument) * build * upload (if you want to host your package in pypi) * document (of course this could be run at any point)Important Information=====================This template is based on pipenv. In order to be compatible with requirements.txt so the actual created package can be used by any part of the existing python ecosystem some hacks were needed.So when building a package out of this **do not** simple call    $ python setup.py sdist bdist_egg**as this will produce an unusable artifact with files missing.**Instead use the provided build and upload scripts that create all the necessary files in the artifact.Project Features================* TODOHistory-------0.0.1 (19-07-2019)---------------------* First code creation0.1.0 (19-07-2019)------------------* initial code implementation0.2.0 (20-07-2019)------------------* Exposed transaction objects0.2.1 (20-07-2019)------------------* Reverted to default provided value for account transaction amount0.3.0 (21-07-2019)------------------* Removed uneeded properties from account transaction0.4.0 (21-07-2019)------------------* Exposed actually existing attribute1.0.0 (24-07-2019)------------------* Initial working version with accounts, foreign accounts and transaction retrieval.1.0.1 (25-07-2019)------------------* made credit card a Comparable1.0.2 (25-07-2019)------------------* Generalized the comparison of Comparable objects2.0.0 (26-07-2019)------------------* Implemented a credit card contract to make credit cards compatible with bank accounts3.0.0 (26-07-2019)------------------* Refactored code to use external dependency and implemented a contract interface standardizing the retrieval of accounts.3.0.1 (28-07-2019)------------------* Fixed session dropping issue3.0.2 (28-07-2019)------------------* Made error in retrieving non breaking3.0.3 (28-07-2019)------------------* Made retrieving of objects safe and implemented backoff for get methods3.0.4 (28-07-2019)------------------* Removed unnecessary method call3.0.5 (28-07-2019)------------------* Extended logging3.0.6 (28-07-2019)------------------* Updated dependencies3.0.7 (28-07-2019)------------------* Added logging3.0.8 (28-07-2019)------------------* Updated logging3.0.9 (28-07-2019)------------------* Removed unneeded logging3.0.10 (30-07-2019)-------------------* Extended logging3.1.0 (02-08-2019)------------------* Uniquely identify a transaction and an account3.1.1 (16-08-2019)------------------* renamed underlying dependency and updated the code accordingly and fixed bug with a pop up covering the submission of the login.3.2.0 (17-08-2019)------------------* Shortened timout on click event on log in.3.2.1 (29-08-2019)------------------* Added latest popup window4.0.0 (13-09-2019)------------------* Implemented cookie based authentication5.0.0 (09-12-2019)------------------* Implemented cookie authentication for credit card and moved relevant shared code into a common module.5.1.0 (10-12-2019)------------------* Implemented retrieving transaction by date, by ranges of dates and since a date.5.2.0 (10-12-2019)------------------* Fixed name of method.5.2.1 (26-10-2020)------------------* Fixed bug with new cookie header required by ICS.5.2.2 (16-04-2021)------------------* Made retrieval by date ranges a bit stricter on the accepted input and bumped dependencies.5.3.0 (06-07-2021)------------------* Implemented date retrieval, fixed a bug with short cookies.5.3.1 (07-07-2021)------------------* Added pipeline and bumped dependencies.5.3.2 (07-07-2021)------------------* Added pipeline and bumped dependencies.</longdescription>

	<longdescription># Microsoft Azure SDK for PythonThis is the Microsoft Azure Recovery Services Client Library.This package has been tested with Python 3.7+.For a more complete view of Azure libraries, see the [azure sdk python release](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/all).## _Disclaimer__Azure SDK Python packages support for Python 2.7 has ended 01 January 2022. For more information and questions, please refer to https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/20691_## Getting started### Prerequisites- Python 3.7+ is required to use this package.- [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)### Install the package```bashpip install azure-mgmt-recoveryservicespip install azure-identity```### AuthenticationBy default, [Azure Active Directory](https://aka.ms/awps/aad) token authentication depends on correct configure of following environment variables.- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` for Azure client ID.- `AZURE_TENANT_ID` for Azure tenant ID.- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` for Azure client secret.In addition, Azure subscription ID can be configured via environment variable `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`.With above configuration, client can be authenticated by following code:```pythonfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredentialfrom azure.mgmt.recoveryservices import RecoveryServicesClientimport ossub_id = os.getenv(&quot;AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID&quot;)client = RecoveryServicesClient(credential=DefaultAzureCredential(), subscription_id=sub_id)```## ExamplesCode samples for this package can be found at [Recovery Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/browse/?languages=python&amp;term=Getting%20started%20-%20Managing&amp;terms=Getting%20started%20-%20Managing) on docs.microsoft.com and [Samples Repo](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt/samples)## Troubleshooting## Next steps## Provide FeedbackIf you encounter any bugs or have suggestions, please file an issue in the[Issues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues)section of the project. ![Impressions](https://azure-sdk-impressions.azurewebsites.net/api/impressions/azure-sdk-for-python%2Fazure-mgmt-recoveryservices%2FREADME.png)# Release History## 2.3.0 (2023-02-15)### Other Changes  - Upgraded api-version to `2023-01-01`## 2.2.0 (2022-11-30)### Features Added  - Added operation RecoveryServicesOperations.capabilities  - Model PrivateEndpointConnection has a new parameter group_ids  - Model VaultProperties has a new parameter public_network_access  - Model VaultProperties has a new parameter security_settings## 2.1.0 (2022-07-28)**Features**  - Model PrivateEndpointConnectionVaultProperties has a new parameter location  - Model PrivateEndpointConnectionVaultProperties has a new parameter name  - Model PrivateEndpointConnectionVaultProperties has a new parameter type  - Model ResourceCertificateAndAadDetails has a new parameter aad_audience  - Model Sku has a new parameter capacity  - Model Sku has a new parameter family  - Model Sku has a new parameter size  - Model VaultProperties has a new parameter backup_storage_version  - Model VaultProperties has a new parameter monitoring_settings  - Model VaultProperties has a new parameter move_details  - Model VaultProperties has a new parameter move_state  - Model VaultProperties has a new parameter redundancy_settings## 2.0.0 (2021-07-12)**Features**  - Model PatchTrackedResource has a new parameter etag  - Model Resource has a new parameter etag  - Model VaultProperties has a new parameter encryption  - Model PatchVault has a new parameter etag  - Model Sku has a new parameter tier  - Model VaultExtendedInfoResource has a new parameter etag  - Model ResourceCertificateAndAadDetails has a new parameter service_resource_id  - Model Vault has a new parameter system_data  - Model Vault has a new parameter etag  - Model IdentityData has a new parameter user_assigned_identities  - Model TrackedResource has a new parameter etag  - Added operation VaultsOperations.begin_update  - Added operation VaultsOperations.begin_create_or_update  - Added operation group RecoveryServicesClientOperationsMixin**Breaking changes**  - Model PatchTrackedResource no longer has parameter e_tag  - Model Resource no longer has parameter e_tag  - Model PatchVault no longer has parameter e_tag  - Model VaultExtendedInfoResource no longer has parameter e_tag  - Model Vault no longer has parameter e_tag  - Model TrackedResource no longer has parameter e_tag  - Removed operation VaultsOperations.create_or_update  - Removed operation VaultsOperations.update## 1.0.0 (2020-12-17)**Features**  - Model PatchVault has a new parameter identity## 1.0.0b1 (2020-11-10)This is beta preview version.This version uses a next-generation code generator that introduces important breaking changes, but also important new features (like unified authentication and async programming).**General breaking changes**- Credential system has been completly revamped:  - `azure.common.credentials` or `msrestazure.azure_active_directory` instances are no longer supported, use the `azure-identity` classes instead: https://pypi.org/project/azure-identity/  - `credentials` parameter has been renamed `credential`- The `config` attribute no longer exists on a client, configuration should be passed as kwarg. Example: `MyClient(credential, subscription_id, enable_logging=True)`. For a complete set of  supported options, see the [parameters accept in init documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#available-policies)- You can't import a `version` module anymore, use `__version__` instead- Operations that used to return a `msrest.polling.LROPoller` now returns a `azure.core.polling.LROPoller` and are prefixed with `begin_`.- Exceptions tree have been simplified and most exceptions are now `azure.core.exceptions.HttpResponseError` (`CloudError` has been removed).- Most of the operation kwarg have changed. Some of the most noticeable:  - `raw` has been removed. Equivalent feature can be found using `cls`, a callback that will give access to internal HTTP response for advanced user  - For a complete set of  supported options, see the [parameters accept in Request documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#available-policies)**General new features**- Type annotations support using `typing`. SDKs are mypy ready.- This client has now stable and official support for async. Check the `aio` namespace of your package to find the async client.- This client now support natively tracing library like OpenCensus or OpenTelemetry. See this [tracing quickstart](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/core/azure-core-tracing-opentelemetry) for an overview.## 0.5.0 (2020-04-21)**Features**  - Model Vault has a new parameter identity  - Model VaultProperties has a new parameter private_endpoint_state_for_backup  - Model VaultProperties has a new parameter private_endpoint_connections  - Model VaultProperties has a new parameter private_endpoint_state_for_site_recovery  - Added operation group PrivateLinkResourcesOperations**General Breaking Changes**This version uses a next-generation code generator that *might*introduce breaking changes. In summary, some modules were incorrectlyvisible/importable and have been renamed. This fixed several issuescaused by usage of classes that were not supposed to be used in thefirst place.  - RecoveryServicesClient cannot be imported from    `azure.mgmt.recoveryservices.cost_management_client` anymore (import from    `azure.mgmt.recoveryservices` works like before)  - RecoveryServicesClientConfiguration import has been moved from    `azure.mgmt.recoveryservices.cost_management_client` to `azure.mgmt.recoveryservices`  - A model `MyClass` from a &quot;models&quot; sub-module cannot be imported    anymore using `azure.mgmt.recoveryservices.models.my_class` (import from    `azure.mgmt.recoveryservices.models` works like before)  - An operation class `MyClassOperations` from an `operations`    sub-module cannot be imported anymore using    `azure.mgmt.recoveryservices.operations.my_class_operations` (import from    `azure.mgmt.recoveryservices.operations` works like before)Last but not least, HTTP connection pooling is now enabled by default.You should always use a client as a context manager, or call close(), oruse no more than one client per process.## 0.4.0 (2019-04-05)**Features**  - Added operation recovery_services.check_name_availability## 0.3.0 (2018-05-25)**Breaking Changes**  - Removed operation group BackupVaultConfigsOperations (moved to    azure-mgmt-recoveryservicesbackup)  - Removed operation group BackupStorageConfigsOperations (moved to    azure-mgmt-recoveryservicesbackup)**Features**  - Client class can be used as a context manager to keep the underlying    HTTP session open for performance**General Breaking changes**This version uses a next-generation code generator that *might*introduce breaking changes.  - Model signatures now use only keyword-argument syntax. All    positional arguments must be re-written as keyword-arguments. To    keep auto-completion in most cases, models are now generated for    Python 2 and Python 3. Python 3 uses the &quot;*&quot; syntax for    keyword-only arguments.  - Enum types now use the &quot;str&quot; mixin (class AzureEnum(str, Enum)) to    improve the behavior when unrecognized enum values are encountered.    While this is not a breaking change, the distinctions are important,    and are documented here:    &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#others&gt; At a glance:      - &quot;is&quot; should not be used at all.      - &quot;format&quot; will return the string value, where &quot;%s&quot; string        formatting will return `NameOfEnum.stringvalue`. Format syntax        should be prefered.  - New Long Running Operation:      - Return type changes from        `msrestazure.azure_operation.AzureOperationPoller` to        `msrest.polling.LROPoller`. External API is the same.      - Return type is now **always** a `msrest.polling.LROPoller`,        regardless of the optional parameters used.      - The behavior has changed when using `raw=True`. Instead of        returning the initial call result as `ClientRawResponse`,        without polling, now this returns an LROPoller. After polling,        the final resource will be returned as a `ClientRawResponse`.      - New `polling` parameter. The default behavior is        `Polling=True` which will poll using ARM algorithm. When        `Polling=False`, the response of the initial call will be        returned without polling.      - `polling` parameter accepts instances of subclasses of        `msrest.polling.PollingMethod`.      - `add_done_callback` will no longer raise if called after        polling is finished, but will instead execute the callback right        away.**Bugfixes**  - Compatibility of the sdist with wheel 0.31.0## 0.2.0 (2017-10-16)**Bugfixes**  - blob_duration is now a str (from iso-8601)  - &quot;service_specification&quot; is renamed    &quot;properties.service_specification&quot;  - Fix operations list## 0.1.1 (2019-03-12)  - Updating permissible versions of the msrestazure package to unblock    [Azure/azure-cli#6973](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/6973).## 0.1.0 (2017-07-20)  - Initial Release</longdescription>

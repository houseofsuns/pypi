	<longdescription>******AppCLI******..  AppCLI is a Python library for making command-line applications.  More   broadly, it's a framework for defining object properties that read their   default values from arbitrary sources, e.g. the command-line, configuration   files, environment variables, REST APIs, etc.  defining objects with properties that are initialized from blah blah blah  sources such as the command line,   It works by (allowing|providing a framework for) objects to define parameters   that are initialized|read from external sources, e.g. the command-line,   configuration files, environment variables.    It works by giving classes a simple way to define parameters that will be   initialized from external sources, e.g. the command-line, configuration   files, environment variables, etc.  It works by providing a simple way for classes to define parameters that will   be initialized from external sources, e.g. the command-line, configuration   files, environment variables, etc.  Library for making command-line applications in python.  More broadly, it's a framework for creating objects with parameters that can   read default values from multiple sources, e.g. the command-line, config   files, environmnt variables, etc.  for defining object parameters that can query multiple sources---e.g. the   command-line, configuration files, environment variables, etc.---  default parameters of an object     Philosophy  -   - Params from any source;   -   Benefits  - Params from any source  - objects usable from python  Example  - Can't have so many comments; makes it hard to grok.  - Just want to give a sense of what it looks like.  - Advanced users will want to see the syntax to get a sense of how it works.  - Features to include:    - cast?      - int/float: do some math thing?    - default?    - at least two configs      - docopt      - appcli?      - env var?    - .. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/appcli.svg   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/appcli.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/appcli.svg   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/appcli.. image:: https://img.shields.io/readthedocs/appcli.svg   :target: https://appcli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest.. image:: https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/kalekundert/appcli/Test%20and%20release/master   :target: https://github.com/kalekundert/appcli/actions.. image:: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/kalekundert/appcli.svg   :target: https://coveralls.io/github/kalekundert/appcli?branch=masterAppCLI is a Library for making command line apps.  You can also think of it as a library for initializing objects with values from disparate sources, e.g.  config files, environment variables, command-line options, etc.  It's philosophy is that (i) it should be easy to incorporate options from the command line and config files, and (ii) the object should remain usable as a normal object in python.Usage=====The following snippets introduce the basic concepts behind ``appcli``::    import appcli    from appcli import DocoptConfig, AppDirsConfig, Key    # Inheriting from App will give us the ability to instantiate MyApp objects     # without calling the constructor, i.e. exclusively using information from     # the command-line and the config files.  We'll take advantage of this in     # the '__main__' block at the end of the script:    class MyApp(appcli.App):        &quot;&quot;&quot;    Do a thing.    Usage:        myapp &lt;x&gt; [-y]    &quot;&quot;&quot;                # The `__config__` class variable defines locations to search for         # parameter values.  In this case, we specify that `docopt` should be         # used to parse command line arguments, and that `appdirs` should be         # used to find configuration files.  Note however that appcli is not         # tied to any particular command-line argument parser or file format.          # A wide variety of `Config` classes come with `appcli`, and it's also         # easy to write your own.        __config__ = [                DocoptConfig(),                AppDirsConfig(),        ]                # The `appcli.param()` calls define attributes that will take their         # value from the configuration source specified above.  For example,         # the `x` parameter will look for an argument named `&lt;x&gt;` specified on         # the command line.  The `y` parameter is similar, but will also (i)         # look for a value in the configuration files if none if specified on         # the command line, (ii) convert the value to an integer, and (iii) use         # a default of 0 if no other value is found.        x = appcli.param(                Key(DocoptConfig, '&lt;x&gt;'),        )        y = appcli.param(                Key(DocoptConfig, '-y'),                Key(AppDirsConfig, 'y'),                cast=int,                default=0,        )        # Define a constructor because we want this object to be fully usable         # from python.  Because &lt;x&gt; is a required argument on the command line,         # it makes sense for it to be a required argument to the constructor as         # well.        def __init__(self, x):            self.x = x        # Define one or more methods that actually do whatever this application         # is supposed to do.  These methods can be named anything; think of         # MyApp as a totally normal class by this point.  Note that `x` and `y`         # can be used exactly like regular attributes.        def main(self):            return self.x * self.y    # Invoke the application from the command line.  Note that we can't call     # the constructor because it requires an `x` argument, and we don't have     # that information yet (because it will come from the command line).      # Instead we use the `from_params()` method provided by `appcli.App`.  This     # constructs an instance of MyApp without calling the construtor, instead     # depending fully on the command-line and the configuration files to     # provide values for every parameter.  The call to `appcli.load()` triggers     # the command line to be parsed, such that the `app` instance is fully     # initialized when the `main()` method is called.    if __name__ == '__main__':        app = Main.from_params()        appcli.load(app)        app.main()Note that we could seamlessly use this object in another python script::    from myapp import MyApp    # Because we don't call `appcli.load()` in this script, the command line     # would not be parsed.  The configuration files would still be read,     # however.  In the snippet below, for example, the value of `app.y` could     # come from the configuration file.  See `Config.autoload` for more     # information on controlling which configs are used in which contexts.    app = MyApp('abc')    app.main()Examples========For some examples of ``appcli`` being used in real scripts, check out the `Stepwise — Molecular Biology`__ repository.  Almost every script in this repository uses ``appcli``.  Below are some particular scripts that might be useful:Simple scripts:- `aliquot.py &lt;https://github.com/kalekundert/stepwise_mol_bio/blob/master/stepwise_mol_bio/aliquot.py&gt;`_- `anneal.py &lt;https://github.com/kalekundert/stepwise_mol_bio/blob/master/stepwise_mol_bio/anneal.py&gt;`_- `kld.py &lt;https://github.com/kalekundert/stepwise_mol_bio/blob/master/stepwise_mol_bio/kld.py&gt;`_Long but straight-forward scripts:- `pcr.py &lt;https://github.com/kalekundert/stepwise_mol_bio/blob/master/stepwise_mol_bio/pcr.py&gt;`_- `spin_cleanup.py &lt;https://github.com/kalekundert/stepwise_mol_bio/blob/master/stepwise_mol_bio/spin_cleanup.py&gt;`_- `gels/gel.py &lt;https://github.com/kalekundert/stepwise_mol_bio/blob/master/stepwise_mol_bio/gels/gel.py&gt;`_- `gels/stain.py &lt;https://github.com/kalekundert/stepwise_mol_bio/blob/master/stepwise_mol_bio/gels/stain.py&gt;`_Complex scripts:- `serial_dilution.py &lt;https://github.com/kalekundert/stepwise_mol_bio/blob/master/stepwise_mol_bio/serial_dilution.py&gt;`_  This script features parameters that depend on other parameters.    Specifically, the user must provide values for any three of ``volume``,   ``conc_high``, ``conc_low``, and ``factor``.  Whichever one isn't specified   is inferred from the ones that are.  This is implemented by making the   ``appcli`` parameters (which in this case read only from the command-line and   not from any config files) private, then adding public properties that are   calculated from the private ones.- `digest.py &lt;https://github.com/kalekundert/stepwise_mol_bio/blob/master/stepwise_mol_bio/digest.py&gt;`_  This script is actually pretty simple, but it makes used of   ``__bareinit__()`` to download some data from the internet.  As alluded to   above, ``__init__()`` is not called when ``App`` instances are initialized   from the command-line, because ``__init__()`` might require arbitrary   arguments and is therefore considered to be part of the python API.  Instead,   ``App`` instances are initialized by calling ``__bareinit__()`` with no   arguments.- `ivtt.py &lt;https://github.com/kalekundert/stepwise_mol_bio/blob/master/stepwise_mol_bio/ivtt.py&gt;`_  This script defines a custom ``Config`` class to read from a sequence   database. (This example might go out of date, though; I have plans to move   that custom ``Config`` into a different package.)__ https://github.com/kalekundert/stepwise_mol_bio </longdescription>

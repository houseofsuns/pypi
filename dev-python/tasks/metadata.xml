	<longdescription># TasksProof of concept for a simple task queue, with a focus on UX and clean internal design.![Screenshot of a tasks session](images/demo.png)Tasks can be installed through pip: `pip3 install tasks`, run with `tasks`.## Status for i3Follow these steps to add the output of `status` to your i3 status bar.1. Set up a cron job (`crontab -e`) that saves the status every minute.   ```   * * * * * /path/to/tasks status &gt; $HOME/.tasks.status   ```2. Configure i3 to use the provided status wrapper (installed alongside the `tasks` command.)   ```   ...       status_command tasks-i3status   ...   ```## Ubiquitous CaptureIt is very useful to have a quick and low-friction way to add new items from anywhere. This can be achieved by combining tasks with a generic dialog tool and your window manager keybindings.Example using zenity and i3:```bindsym $mod+t exec --no-startup-id bash -c &quot;zenity --title 'Add TODO item' --text 'What needs to be done?' --entry --width 450 | xargs tasks addt&quot;```Note that you will want to use tasks &gt;= 2.7.0 for this since it detects external modification of the state file.## Automatic standup emailThe `standup` command shows (among other things) recently completed items. One use case is to send this list to your phone to have it ready for a daily standup. The repo contains a script (under `scripts`) to send stdin as an email with Mailgun which you can then combine with a cron job as follows.```API_KEY=...DOMAIN=...EMAIL=...30 9 * * tue,wed,thu,fri /path/to/tasks standup 1 | /path/to/mailgun.sh30 9 * * mon /path/to/tasks standup 3 | /path/to/mailgun.sh```## DevelopmentTo get started, have a look at the todo items for this project.```make dev_install  # one-time setupmake todo```### ContributingPull requests are welcome. Please do keep in mind that the code is heavily inspired by the [Elm architecture](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/) and consider the following guidelines. * Avoid mutation whenever possible, take advantage of [PEP 448](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0448/) to create updated versions of collections instead. * Side effects (and only side effects) should be in `main.py`; all other modules should be limited to pure code. * Avoid classes unless you have a really good reason for them (the code does not have any classes at the moment.)</longdescription>

A., &amp; Denzler, J. (2019). *Integrating domain knowledge: using hierarchies to improve deep classifiers*. In Asian Conference on Pattern Recognition (ACPR) * **CHILLAX** Brust, C.

In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).**Datasets**\CHIA has integrated support including hierarchies for a number of popular datasets. See [here](docs/architecture.md#dataset) for a complete list.## Installation and Getting StartedCHIA is available on PyPI. To install, simply run:```bashpip install chia```or clone this repository, and run:```bashpip install -e .```To run the [example experiment](examples/experiment.py) which makes sure that everything works, use the following command:```bashpython examples/experiment.py examples/configuration.json```After a few minutes, the last lines of output should look like this:```text[SHUTDOWN] [Experiment] Successful: True```## DocumentationThe following articles explain more about CHIA: * [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) explains the overall construction. It also includes reference descriptions of most classes. * [Configuration](docs/configuration.md) describes how experiments and CHIA itself are configured. * [Using your own dataset](docs/dataset.md) explains our JSON format for adding your own data.## CitationIf you use CHIA for your research, kindly cite:&gt; Brust, C. A., &amp; Denzler, J. (2019). Integrating domain knowledge: using hierarchies to improve deep classifiers. In Asian Conference on Pattern Recognition.

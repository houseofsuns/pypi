The [ULTERA Project](https://ultera.org), along is led by [Phases Research Lab](https://phaseslab.com) at Penn State. As a part of it, we developed a new large-scale database of high entropy alloys (HEAs) reported in the literaturealong with their experimental properties. As of March 2023, the database containsaround 6,000 property data points of 2,500 HEAs coming from almost 500 publications. It iscurrently the largest database of HEAs in the world, and while it is not publicly availablewe welcome collaborators who would like to use it in their research or contribute to it.ULTERA Database is not simply a dataset but features a robust set of data processing, curation, and aggregation tools we built for the last 3 years. These tools allowed us to remove around the 5-10% erroneous data we identified in datasets available in the literature.Most of our tools are not published yet, as the project is ongoing (they give us a competitiveadvantage), and because most of the tools require an elaborate computing infrastructure setup.However, as some of them are less-infrastructure-demanding and are, at the same timehighly applicable outside HEAs, we decided to release them as separate packages. This repositorycontains the first of such packages, **PyQAlloy**, which is a Python package for detecting dataabnormalities in datasets of arbitrary alloys, ranging from complex, concentrated solutions, i.e.High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) / Multi Principle Element Alloys (MPEAs) / Concentrated Complex Alloys (CCAs) to more traditional alloys such as steels, nickel-based superalloys, etc.## InstallationAt the moment, PyQAlloy is not available on PyPI, so you need to clone the repository and installit in editable mode. While not required, it is recommended to first set up a virtual environment using venv or Conda. This ensures that one of the required versions of Python (3.9+) is used and there are no dependency conflicts. If you have Conda installed on your system (see instructions at https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), you can create a new environment with:    conda create -n pyqalloy python=3.9 jupyter    conda activate pyqalloyThen, clone PyQAlloy from GitHub like    git clone https://github.com/PhasesResearchLab/PyQAlloy.gitOr by downloading a ZIP file (not recommended if you want to make changes). Please note this will, by default, download the latest development version of the software, which may not be stable. For a stable version, you can specify a version tag after the URL with `--branch &lt;tag_name&gt; --single-branch`.Then, move to the PyQAlloy folder and install in editable (`-e`) mode.    cd PyQAlloy    pip install -e .If you are using the [**ULTERA Project**](https://ultera.org) infrastructure, now you should fill in your details into the `pyqalloy/credentials.json` with `name`, `dbKey`, and `dataServer` fields, and you should be ready to go! :)If you are not using the ULTERA infrastructure, you will need to set up your own MongoDB database and fill it with data that conforms to the ULTERA schema. This will be quite elaborate, but we have the tools to do it, and we can assist you. </longdescription>

	<longdescription>## OverviewThis module is intended to be installed on the production NCS nodes and imported in other services/actions that need to gather state from the network.  It uses the NCS device manager and the standard python `multiprocessing` library to connect to devices in-parallel and issue commands, returning results as structured data.## Usage informationBasic usage example in an NCS callback:``` pythonfrom umnet_pyncs.state import StateManager...class DemoAction(Action):    @Action.action    def cb_action(self, uinfo, name, kp, input, output, trans):        ...        with StateManager() as m:            interfaces = m.get_state(al_devices, [&quot;get-interface-details&quot;])            arp = m.get_state(dl_devices, [&quot;get-arp-table&quot;])            ...```## Supported commandsCurrently supported commands are:- `get-mac-table`- `get-arp-table`- `get-interface-details`- `get-transciever-details`- `get-lldp-neighbors`- `get-bfd-neighbors`- `get-ospf-neighbors`## Developer testingUse the `run_cmds` script to start a session with the local `ncs` daemon and test the various state gathering commands``` shell[grundler@ncs-1 umnet-pyncs]$ ./run_cmds -husage: run_cmds [-h] -c CMD -d DEVoptional arguments:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  -c CMD, --cmd CMD  -d DEV, --device DEV[grundler@ncs-1 umnet-pyncs]$[grundler@ncs-1 umnet-pyncs]$[grundler@ncs-1 umnet-pyncs]$ ./run_cmds -d s-ehall-2012p-1 -c get-interface-detailsINFO:root:connecting to ncs...INFO:root:transaction started...INFO:root:submitting commands to worker pool (1)DEBUG:root:pid: 19275: invoking get-interface-details against s-ehall-2012p-1DEBUG:root:sending 'show interfaces' to s-ehall-2012p-1...```For any given command, the various platform-specific models are responsible for implementing how the data is fetched and parsed from the remote device.  Each command corresponds to a method that can be invoked to retrieve the data, e.g. `get-interface-details` maps to the `get_interface_details()` instance method of the model(s).For Cisco IOS and NXOS devices (which use CLI-based NEDs), the built-in NCS `live-status` action(s) are used to send raw CLI commands to the device.  For example, the `get_mac_address()` method will send a `show mac address-table` CLI command.  For both IOS and NXOS we use [ntc_templates](https://github.com/networktocode/ntc-templates) to parse the raw text output into structured data.For Juniper devices, since the NED uses NETCONF for all device communications, we instead call the `&lt;get-ethernet-switching-table-information&gt;` RPC directly.  Since this RPC is modelled in YANG, we can then parse the results directly using the maagic API.All the nitty-gritty details of parsing the data retrieved directly from the remote device is handled by the platform-specific model implementation for that device.  Each model normalizes the data using the dataclasses defined in [base.py](./umnet_pyncs/state/models/base.py).  The intention is to makes it simpler for NCS actions/services to use this module, as well as making it easier to develop/maintain.**NB**: this implementation currently relies on an additional template for NXOS that handles parsing `show ip arp detail vrf all` -- see [PR# 1204](https://github.com/networktocode/ntc-templates/pull/1204).</longdescription>

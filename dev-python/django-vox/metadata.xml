	<longdescription>==========Django Vox==========|pipeline-badge| |coverage-badge| |docs-badge| |pypi-badge|Django vox is a django app that allow you to create and issuedifferent types of notifications. Notifications can have differentkinds of parameters which allow for convenient editing in the admin.Features---------------* Add and edit notifications from the admin* Built-in message editor provides drop-down of available template variables  and supports previewing* Supports many backends: email (html &amp; text), SMS (Twilio), Twitter, Slack,  Postmark, XMPP, JSON webhooks, and Activity Streams* Supports attachments* Built in site contacts that can be used to send emails to admins, or update  your organization‘s Twitter account, or send out webhooks* Flexible API allows you to define your own user preferences about which user  gets which kind of notification* Set custom “from” addresses* Send messages in bulk (all together) or individually customized messagesWhy this exists---------------TLDR: Because I am lazy and I don't want to spend my evening doinga deploy just because marketing wants to update the text in theirlatest spam mail.In a few more words:* Editing copy for notifications shouldn't have to be done by programmers.  This means:  1. The notification templates should be editable in the admin  2. The information necessary to correctly make a template, whether     it's a template ID or parameters) should be available in the admin     page. It shouldn't be necessary to look through source code just to     make a notification work.  3. Number 2 is actually a fairly difficult problem.* People have different ways of interacting with computers, and one  way of doing notifications (i.e. email) doesn't always make sense.  1. Added to that, sending a text message that's as verbose as an HTML     email is simply ridiculous. Each medium begets its own kind of     content.  2. Since, as we mentioned earlier, content should be manageable     by non-programmers, the different ways of sending messages should     be manageable by non-programmers.I want it, stat!----------------Well, why don't you just head over to `the documentation`_ and we'llget you started. A word of warning, it's not super simple to setup, butit's worth it... |pipeline-badge| image:: https://gitlab.com/alantrick/django-vox/badges/master/pipeline.svg   :target: https://gitlab.com/alantrick/django-vox/   :alt: Build Status.. |coverage-badge| image:: https://gitlab.com/alantrick/django-vox/badges/master/coverage.svg   :target: https://gitlab.com/alantrick/django-vox/   :alt: Coverage Status.. |docs-badge| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-latest-informational.svg   :target: `the documentation`_   :alt: Documentation.. |pypi-badge| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/django_vox.svg   :target: https://pypi.org/project/django-vox/   :alt: Project on PyPI.. _the documentation: https://alantrick.gitlab.io/django-vox/CHANGES=======4.0.6-----* Fix a bug where a contact could get the same notification twice4.0.5-----* Fix another circular import dependency issue4.0.4-----* Fix a potential circular import dependency issue4.0.3-----* Fix a bug with get_recipient_choices ignoring the registered channels4.0.2-----* Fix a bug when Notification.issue is passed SimpleLazyObject4.0.1-----* Fix a bug with ``Channel.field``4.0---This version includes a new registration system for models so that youdon’t have to subclass ``VoxModel`` (which is a problem for 3rd party models).The new way of registering the models is described in detail in thedocumentation.Incompatibilities with Version 3:* The actor &amp; target arguments on ``Notification.issue`` must be specified  by keyword arguments now. This doesn’t affect  ``VoxModel.issue_notification``, so it’s only relevant if you were manually  loading Notifications and triggering them.* A few default backends were are no longer defaultsOther changes:* Backend settings can just reference the class, and not the module* Notify will use a default address if none is specified* Notifications now have a “last updated” field3.6---* Fix bug in notification editor where switching one template's backend would  alter the state of the another template form.* Add more tests* Make ``Backend.send_message`` an instance method, and instantiate backend  objects when sending messages. This is a significant API change, but it's  unlikely to actually cause backwards compatibility issues.* Add title to notify page3.5.3-----* Fix bugs in demo caused by slug* Add icon3.5.2-----* Add better support and testing for non-ID primary keys3.5.1-----* Fix packaging problem (missing files)3.5---* Fix some javascript problems on Django 2.1 &amp; 2.2* Add one-time message admin actions3.4---* Fix crash when a non VoxModel model is registered3.3---* Pin to a newer version of august, it works much better* Be slightly more sophisticated with our activity data parsing3.2---* fix implementation of activity\_type parameter* Fix bug issuing notifications with non VoxModel objects* Fix bug where django will crash if ``to_addresses`` is a generator* Omit skipping message when notification is not from code* Fix bug where we kept recreating notifications* Keep orphaned notifications with templates so we don't delete data3.1---* Add ability to remove notifications of deleted classes* Fix error in notification editor when using grappelli3.0---* Rewrite that add support for multiple participants2.3---* add ``read_at`` field on inbox items* Users should be posting read activities to outbox, duh2.2---* Add the ability to post to inboxes and read messages2.1---* Redo activity schema so that its more straightforward* fix bug in ``background_task`` implementation2.0.0-----* Add activity backend1.1.0-----* Replace newlines in subject with space* Add support for resending failed messages* A few improvements to the admin* Add Grappelli compatibility1.0.0-----First stable release</longdescription>

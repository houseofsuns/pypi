	<longdescription>.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epri-dev/OpenDER/develop_req_SQA/docs/logo.png    :alt: Open-source Distributed Energy Resources (OpenDER) ModelEPRI’s OpenDER model aims to accurately represent steady-state and dynamic behaviors of inverter-based distributedenergy resources (DERs). The model follows interconnection standards or grid-codes and is informed by the observedbehaviors of commercial products. Currently, model version 2.0 includes photovoltaic (PV) and battery energy storagesystem (BESS) DER behaviors according to the capabilities and functionalities required by the IEEE standard 1547-2018.This first-of-its-kind model can be used to run snapshot, Quasi-Static Time Series (QSTS), and a variety of dynamicanalyses to study the impacts of DERs on distribution operations and planning.This project is licensed under the terms of the BSD-3 clause license... |GitHub license| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/License-BSD_3--Clause-blue.svg   :target: https://github.com/epri-dev/opender/blob/master/LICENSE.txtResources---------OpenDER is under active development.

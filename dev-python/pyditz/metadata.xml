	<longdescription>PyDitz -- a distributed issue tracker=====================================[![builds.sr.ht status](https://builds.sr.ht/~zondo/pyditz.svg)](https://builds.sr.ht/~zondo/pyditz?)Introduction------------This package is intended to be a drop-in replacement for the[Ditz](http://rubygems.org/gems/ditz) distributed issue tracker.  Itprovides a `pyditz` command-line program, which acts (mostly) the same wayas `ditz`, and it adds several other nice things too:- Whereas `ditz`, when typed on its own, runs the `todo` command, `pyditz`  drops you into a command shell where you can run Ditz commands and get  completion on command names, issue names and release names according to  context.- With PyDitz, you don't have to run it from the same directory where the  issue database is; it will look in parent directories for it.- It keeps an intelligent cache of issues, so parsing of all the YAML files  isn't necessary for each command.  This greatly improves speed when you  have lots of issues.- You can extend PyDitz using plugins that you write: either simple  standalone files (similar to the `ditz` 'hook' feature), or packages that  use [setuptools](http://pythonhosted.org/setuptools) entrypoints.- You can use the database engine of PyDitz in Python programs to migrate  bug databases to and from Ditz format, or create summary reports in your  own favourite format.Requirements------------To install and run it:* [PyYAML](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyYAML)* [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org)* [Cerberus](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cerberus)* [six](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/six)To have nice terminal highlighting output:* [Pygments](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pygments)* [colorama](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama) if you're on WindowsTo mark up description and comment text in HTML output:* [Markups](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Markups) (and the modules it needs  to function)To run the test suite:* [PyTest](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest)* [Mock](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-mock)To build the documentation:* [Sphinx](http://sphinx.pocoo.org)* The [alabaster](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/alabaster) themeInstallation------------The usual incantation will install things:    pip install pyditzThis will install the `ditz` module and a console command called `pyditz`to invoke in a similar manner to the original `ditz`.  As a convenience toreduce typing, a short-form version of the command is also installed: `pd`.Documentation-------------The current documentation can be found online[here](https://pythonhosted.org/pyditz).  You can also look at an exampleof the [HTML output](https://pythonhosted.org/pyditz/_static/index.html).License-------PyDitz is distributed under the [GNU Lesser General Public License,v2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html) or later.Links-----If you like this, here's a few more things you might want to check out:- [Pitz](https://github.com/mw44118/pitz) is another Ditz-alike issue  tracker, also written in Python.  Its bug database is not compatible with  Ditz, and I didn't have much luck getting it to work, but it might work  for you.- There's another Python project of the same name called  [akaihola-pyditz](https://github.com/akaihola/pyditz).  (I only found it  after publishing mine, or I might have chosen another name.)  Not updated  since 2009, but it has some ideas for logging work that might be useful.- There's also [ditz plus plus](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ditz),  another reimplemenation written in C++, although that hasn't been  updated since mid-2013.- If you're a fan of [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs),  there's a [ditz-mode](https://hg.sr.ht/~zondo/ditz-mode) written for it  that I maintain.  It works with the original Ditz, or PyDitz.Changes-------### Version 0.11 (2020-05-29)* bugfix: Fix up a few I/O problems* bugfix: Problem with --no-search option* bugfix: IPython doesn't work as a plugin* bugfix: Session generation doesn't work with Py3* Add a standard short alias command* Refactor the write_yaml() function* Improve startup time* Sort exported releases by version### Version 0.10.3 (2019-01-11)* bugfix: Fix highlighting customization### Version 0.10.2 (2018-08-31)* bugfix: Resolve problems with cerberus update* bugfix: Resolve problems with markups update### Version 0.10.1 (2017-07-31)* bugfix: Crash when trying to create db### Version 0.10 (2016-11-27)* Improve startup operations* Allow abbreviation of issue names* Sort issues by last-modified time* Implement issue-claiming commands* Use cerberus for data validation### Version 0.9.1 (2016-03-24)* bugfix: Line wrapping problem in terminal* bugfix: Fix problems with version detection* Minor package improvements### Version 0.9 (2015-09-27)* bugfix: Bytes output if pygments is not installed* bugfix: Initialization command doesn't work* Implement the 'edit' command* Implement command plugins* Add support for markup in HTML output* Allow per-project config file* New command to list all issues* Add project file to version control* Add validation schemas* Search more fields with grep### Version 0.8.1 (2015-08-18)* bugfix: Fix non-ASCII text in issue data* bugfix: HTML plugin load failure### Version 0.8 (2014-12-05)* bugfix: Grep arguments not handled correctly* Allow customization of HTML output* Allow issues to be specified by ID* Add progress time indicator to 'show' and HTML* Implement exporting directly to archive* Add section arg to config command* Add exporter plugin system* Add python 3 support* Improve the default HTML style* Move ~/.ditzrc to ~/.ditz/ditz.cfg* Relicense under LGPL### Version 0.7 (2014-09-28)* bugfix: Handle YAML comment char in strings* Add VCS support* Add unicode support* Add issue type column to HTML output* Add command to display configuration* Implement the 'validate' command* Add output highlighting* Add support for command aliases* Add pager support* Improve the documentation* Wire up the remaining program options* Improve configuration settings* Improve logging command output### Version 0.6.2 (2014-08-10)* bugfix: Name substitution not done in issue description### Version 0.6.1 (2014-08-09)* bugfix: Print message on successful unassignment* bugfix: Ignore unreleased releases when assigning issues### Version 0.6 (2014-03-28)* bugfix: Handle non-ASCII characters when writing output* Install as 'ditz' if required by user* Add HTML component column if multiple components in use* Don't show HTML release column for unassigned issues* Print message on successful issue assignment### Version 0.5.2 (2013-12-20)* bugfix: Blank lines shouldn't end a comment### Version 0.5.1 (2013-12-18)* bugfix: Prompt for component when creating issues* bugfix: Show issue status even if not closed### Version 0.5 (2013-12-12)* bugfix: Issue names not replaced in comment text* bugfix: Reconfigure clobbers existing file* Add sortable tables to HTML output* Write some user documentation* Add a user config file### Version 0.4 (2013-12-09)* Implement the 'html' command### Version 0.3 (2013-11-23)* bugfix: Multiple 'issuedir' keywords in init### Version 0.2 (2013-11-23)* bugfix: Fix up problems with blank comments### Version 0.1 (2013-11-23)* bugfix: Fix round-tripping of issue files* Implement all the ditz commands</longdescription>

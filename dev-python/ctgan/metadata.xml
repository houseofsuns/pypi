See the [SDV documentation](https://bit.ly/sdv-docs) to get started.## Use the CTGAN standalone libraryAlternatively, you can also install and use **CTGAN** directly, as a standalone library:**Using `pip`:**```bashpip install ctgan```**Using `conda`:**```bashconda install -c pytorch -c conda-forge ctgan```When using the CTGAN library directly, you may need to manually preprocess your data into the correct format, for example:* Continuous data must be represented as floats* Discrete data must be represented as ints or strings* The data should not contain any missing values# Usage ExampleIn this example we load the [Adult Census Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult)* which is a built-in demo dataset. We use CTGAN to learn from the real data and then generate some synthetic data.```python3from ctgan import CTGANfrom ctgan import load_demoreal_data = load_demo()# Names of the columns that are discretediscrete_columns = [    'workclass',    'education',    'marital-status',    'occupation',    'relationship',    'race',    'sex',    'native-country',    'income']ctgan = CTGAN(epochs=10)ctgan.fit(real_data, discrete_columns)# Create synthetic datasynthetic_data = ctgan.sample(1000)```*For more information about the dataset see:Dua, D. and Graff, C. (2019).

After 4 years of research and traction with enterprise, wecreated [DataCebo](https://datacebo.com) in 2020 with the goal of growing the project.Today, DataCebo is the proud developer of SDV, the largest ecosystem forsynthetic data generation &amp; evaluation. It is home to multiple libraries that support syntheticdata, including:* 🔄 Data discovery &amp; transformation. Reverse the transforms to reproduce realistic data.* 🧠 Multiple machine learning models -- ranging from Copulas to Deep Learning -- to create tabular,  multi table and time series data.* 📊 Measuring quality and privacy of synthetic data, and comparing different synthetic data  generation models.[Get started using the SDV package](https://sdv.dev/SDV/getting_started/install.html) -- a fullyintegrated solution and your one-stop shop for synthetic data.

	<longdescription># fgdb_to_gpkg`fgdb_to_gpkg` is a Python package that converts all feature classes within an [Esri File GeoDatabase](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/data/geodatabases/manage-file-gdb/file-geodatabases.htm) to layers within a [OGC GeoPackage](https://www.geopackage.org). This package is designed to be used from the command line or imported as a module.This package does not have a dependency on ArcPy, which means that you can safely extract feature classes locked inside an Esri File GeoDataBase without needing to worry about any ArcGIS licensing.## Installation#### Installing from PyPI```pip install fgdb-to-gpkg```#### Installing the development version of this package1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/philiporlando/fgdb_to_gdb.git`2. Navigate to the repository directory: `cd fgdb_to_gdb`3. Install the package and its dependencies with [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/): `poetry install`## Usage### Command Line UsageTo use `fgdb_to_gpkg` from the command line, simply call the `fgdb_to_gpkg` command with the path to the input File GeoDatabase and the path to the output GeoPackage:```poetry run python -m fgdb_to_gpkg &lt;input_fgdb_path&gt; &lt;output_gpkg_path&gt;```### Module UsageYou can also import `fgdb_to_gpkg` as a module in Python and use it to convert any Esri File GeoDatabase feature classes to GeoPackage layers programmatically.Here's an example of how to use `fgdb_to_gpkg` as a module:```pythonfrom fgdb_to_gpkg import fgdb_to_gpkginput_fgdb_path = &quot;/path/to/my_fgdb.gdb&quot;output_gpkg_path = &quot;/path/to/my_gpkg.gpkg&quot;fgdb_to_gpkg(input_fgdb_path, output_gpkg_path)# See help(fgdb_to_gpkg) for more details```## TestingUnit tests can be performed by the developers of this package using the following command:```poetry run pytest tests```#### Handling the Fiona GDAL compilation errorThe unit tests within this package depend on `gdal=^3.6.0`, but the current version of `fiona` ships with `gdal=3.5.3`. The fiona package must be installed using the `--no-binary` flag to test this package. If this is not configured properly, then you will see the following error:```pythonpoetry run pytest tests# fiona.errors.DriverError: OpenFileGDB driver requires at least GDAL 3.6.0 for mode 'w', Fiona was compiled against: 3.5.3```The `poetry.toml` file should contain all of the config needed to tell poetry how to handle this issue. However, if `poetry install` does not resolve the issue, then try the following:```pythonpoetry run pip install --force-reinstall fiona --no-binary fiona```</longdescription>

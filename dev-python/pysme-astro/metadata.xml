Since its initial release in[1996](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996A%26AS..118..595V), SME has been asuite of IDL routines that call a dynamically linked library, which iscompiled from C++ and fortran. This classic IDL version of SME is availablefor [download](http://www.stsci.edu/~valenti/sme.html).In 2018, we began began reimplmenting the IDL part of SME in python 3,adopting an object oriented paradigm and continuous itegration practices(code repository, build automation, self-testing, frequent builds).# InstallationA stable version is available on pip `pip install pysme-astro`If you are interested in the latest version you can do so by cloning this git.```bash# Clone the git repositorygit clone https://github.com/AWehrhahn/SME.git# Move to the new directorycd SME# Install this folder (as an editable module)pip install -e .```See also the [documentation](https://pysme-astro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/installation.html)# PosterA poster about PySME can be found here: [Poster](http://sme.astro.uu.se/poster.html)# GUIA GUI for PySME is available in its own repository [PySME-GUI](https://github.com/AWehrhahn/PySME-GUI).# WindowsUnfortunately PySME is not supported in Windows right now. While there is a SME C libary for Windows, it is not compatible with the Python C Extension inteface on Windows as it was compiled with a different compiler. Therefore if you want to use PySME you would need to compile the SME library with the same compiler.</longdescription>

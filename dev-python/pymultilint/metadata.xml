	<longdescription># Multilint (for Python)[![Actions Test Workflow Widget](https://github.com/gkze/multilint/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gkze/multilint/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)[![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pymultilint)](https://pypi.org/project/pymultilint/)[![Pdoc Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/pdoc-docs-green)](https://gkze.github.io/multilint/multilint.html)A utility tying together multiple linting and other code quality tools## IntroMultilint allows running several code quality tools under the same interface.This is convenient as it saves time on writing multiple linter / formatter /checker invocations every time in a project.## InstallationSince there is an existing project called[`multilint`](https://pypi.org/project/multilint/), this Multilint can beinstalled as `pymultilint`:```bash$ pip3 install pymultilint```## UsageMultilint exposes a CLI entry point:```bash$ multilint [paths ...]```It can optionally take a set of starting paths. There are no CLI options,as Multilint strives to have all of its configuration codified (see[Configurability](#configurability)).Alternatively, Multilint is also usable via its API - either the[`main`](multilint.py#L570) method, or the[`Multilint`](multilint.py#L488) class.## Supported ToolsCurrently, Multilint integrates the following code quality tools:* [Autoflake](https://github.com/myint/autoflake) - removes unused imports and  unused variables as identified by [Pyflakes](https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes)* [Isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) - sorts imports according to specified  orders* [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - the self-proclaimed  &quot;uncompromising code formatter&quot; - formats Python source with an opinionated  style* [Mypy](http://mypy-lang.org) - static type checker for Python* [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org) - general best practices linter* [Pydocstyle](http://www.pydocstyle.org/en/stable/) - in-source documentation  best practices linter* [Pyupgrade](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade) - upgrades Python syntax to  the latest for the specified version## ConfigurabilityAdditionally, for tools that do not currently support configuration via`pyproject.toml`([PEP-621](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621/)),Multilint exposes a configuration interface for them. This allows forcentralized codification of configuration of all code quality tools being usedin a project.Example relevant sections from a `pyproject.toml`:```toml[tool.autoflake]recursive = truein_place = trueignore_init_module_imports = trueremove_all_unused_imports = trueremove_unused_variables = trueverbose = truesrcs_paths = [&quot;somepackage&quot;][tool.mypy]src_paths = [&quot;someotherpackage&quot;][tool.multilint]tool_order = [  &quot;autoflake&quot;,  &quot;isort&quot;,  &quot;pyupgrade&quot;,  &quot;black&quot;,  &quot;mypy&quot;,  &quot;pylint&quot;,  &quot;pydocstyle&quot;]src_paths = [&quot;.&quot;]```At the time of writing of this README (2020-01-31), neither[Autoflake](https://github.com/myint/autoflake/issues/59) nor[Mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/5205https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/5205)support configuration via `pyproject.toml`. While support for each may or maynot be added at some point in the future, with multilint configuring these toolsis possible **today**.Currently, the only two supported configuration option for Multilint are:* `tool_order`, which defines the execution order of supported tools, and* `src_paths`, which specifies the source paths (can be files and directories)  for Multilint to operate on.Each integrated tool additionally supports `src_dirs` as an override, in caseit is desired to target a specific tool at a different set of files/ directories.## Extending MultilintSupport for more tools may be added by subclassing the[`ToolRunner`](multilint.py#L128) class and overriding the[`.run(...)`](multilint.py#L160) method.There are some utilities provided, such as:* A logger that masquerades as a TextIO object to allow capturing tool output  from within and wrapping it with preferred logging* A dictionary for tool configuration that is automatically available in the  `ToolRunner` class, as long as the tool is registered in  * The [`Tool`](multilint.py#L48) enum,  * The [`TOOL_RUNNERS`](multilint.py#L480) mapping, and declared  * The [`DEFAULT_TOOL_ORDER`](multilint.py#L500) class variable of `Multilint`.Documentation about adding support for more tools to Multilint may be added inthe future.</longdescription>

	<longdescription>scriptionlight-weight library to enhance command-line scripts; includes conversion ofparameters to specified data types, parameter checking, basic input/output withusers, support for suid [1], sending email, executing sub-programs, and havingsub-commands within a scriptdecorators  - Script:  sets global variables and/or parameters for Commands; the decorated    function will be called by Main/Run before any specified Command  - Command:  marks function as a subcommand for the script (e.g. add, delete,    list, etc.); if no subcommand is specified on the command-line, scription    will look for a Command with the same name as the script  - Alias:  registers other names for Commands (e.g. delete / remove / kill)functions  - Main:  if the importing module's __name__ is __main__, call Run() (this    allows for importing the script as a module)  - Run:  unconditionally attempts to run the Script function (if any) and the    Command found on the command-line  Main() or Run() should be the last thing in the scriptclasses  - Spec:  can be used when defining the command-line parameters (can also just    use tuples)helper functions/classes  - abort: quits immediately by raising SystemExit  - Execute:  class for executing other programs; uses subprocess.Popen by    default, but if `pty=True` is specified then `pty.fork` will be used    (handy for programs that only accept input from a pty)  - get_response:  function for displaying text and getting feedback  - help: quits immediately, but adds a reference to --help in the quit message  - log_exception:  logs an exception with logging.logger  - mail: rudimentary mail sender  - OrmFile:  lightweight orm -- supports str, int, float, date, time,    datetime, bool, and path (which defaults to str); custom data types can    also be specified  - print: wrapper around print that adds a 'verbose_level' keyword (default: 1);    default verbosity is 0 (so print does nothing), but can be increased using    -v, -vv, --verbose, or --verbose=2 (in Python 2 the script must use    'from __future__ import print_function' to use scription's print)  - user_ids:  context manager useful for suid scripts -- all actions taken    within the context are run as the user/group specifiedfeatures  - extra parameters defined by Script are global, and can be accessed from any    function or Command  - 'module' is a namespace inserted into the script  - 'script_command' is the Command selected from the command line (useful when    one needs to call the subcommand directly from a main() function)  - 'script_command_name' is the name of the script_command  - 'script_verbosity' is the level of verboseness selected (defaults to 0)  - 'script_name' is the name of the script  - builtin options are:  --help, --verbose (-v or -vv), --version, --all-versions    --version attempts to display the version of the main package in use    --all-versions attempts to display the versions of any imported packages  - command-line is decoded to unicode under Python 2 (Python 3 does this for us)[1] I use the suid-python program, available at http://selliott.org/python/suid-python.c</longdescription>

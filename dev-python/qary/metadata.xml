With qary, you can build **your** bot to protect you and amplify your prosocial intelligence.We started work on `qary` as part of 1st editition of [NLP in Action](https://proai.org/nlpia2-book).It has slowly grown into the core framework for a social-impact startup [Tangible AI](https://tangibleai.com).Tangible AI [interns and volunteers](/docs/wiki/contributors.md) are constantly fixing bugs, adding new features and dialog trees to qary's repetoire.The [San Diego Python User Group](https://www.pythonsd.org/index.html) meetups have been the scene for [some fun qary demos](https://piped.kavin.rocks/channel/UCXU-oZwaHnoYUhja_yrrrGg).The [San Diego Machine Learning Book Club](https://www.meetup.com/San-Diego-Machine-Learning/) is a great place for support on advanced concepts in the _NLP in Action_ book or anything NLP and machine learning related.You can find more ideas in `docs/`.## Install### Install from sourceRetrieve the source code from GitLab using a bash console:```bashgit clone git@gitlab.com:tangibleai/qarycd qary```If that doesn't work or you don't know what a bash console is, then you probably want to start with the **Windows Users** Instructions here: [docs/README-windows-install.md](docs/README-windows-install.md)Make sure you install `qary` in a _virtual environment_ using the latest version of `pip` and the python `virtualenv` package:```bashpip install --upgrade pip virtualenvpython -m virtualenv venvsource venv/bin/activate```Now that you have your environment activated, make sure you are in the `qary/` repository along side the pyproject.toml file so you can install qary in developer (editable) mode:```bashpip install --editable .```Now you're ready to run `qary` from the command line (bash console):```bashqary &quot;Hi!&quot;```### PyPi package`qary` is on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/qary/) but this install is unlikely to work, unless you've already installed all the dependencies:```bashpip install qary```## Usage```bash$ qary --helpusage: qary [-h] [--version] [--name STR] [-p] [-s STR] [-v] [-vv] [words [words ...]]```### Running `qary` for just one skill```bash$ qary -s qa# ... (logging messages)YOU: When was Barack Obama born?# ... (logging messages)qary: August 4, 1961```### `qary` skills`qary`'s probabilistic conversation manager chooses a reply from the possiblities generated by the different personalities:- `pattern` (`skills/pattern.py`): example skill using regex patterns to reply to greetings like &quot;hi&quot;- `qa` (`skills/qa.py`): BERT and ALBERT Wikipedia Question Answering (WikiQA reading comprehension tests)- `faq` (`skills/faq.py`): answers to frequently asked questions using data/faq/*.yml- `glossary` (`skills/glossary.py`): definitions from glossary yml files in data/faq/glossary-*.yml- `eliza` (`eliza.py`): a python port of the ELIZA therapist bot### Configuring default personalitiesBy default, `qary` runs with `qa` personality. Check out the config file in `qary.ini` to change the default skills loaded for your own custom skill in the skills directory.## Approach`qary`'s chatbot framework allows you to combine many approaches to give you state-of-the-art capability to answer questions and carry on a conversation:1. search: [chatterbot](https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot), [will](https://github.com/skoczen/will)2. pattern matching and response templates: Alexa, [AIML](https://github.com/keiffster/program-y)3. generative deep learning: [robot-bernie](https://github.com/nlpia/robot-bernie), [movie-bot](https://github.com/totalgood/nlpia/blob/master/src/nlpia/book/examples/ch10_movie_dialog_chatbot.py)4. grounding: [snips](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-nlu)It's all explained in detail at [NLP in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/natural-language-processing-in-action).Presentations for San Diego Python User Group are in [docs/](/docs/2019-08-22--San Diego Python User Group -- How to Build a Chatbot.odp) and on the web at [http://totalgood.org/midata/talks](http://totalgood.org/midata/talks/)## Contributing pattern for developersDM @hobs on SD PUG's [discord server](https://discord.gg/yFTAQDxg) if you'd like to join us for weekly collaborative-coding sessions on `qary` and other open source projects.1.

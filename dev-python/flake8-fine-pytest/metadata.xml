It can be configuredin `setup.cfg` file:  ```cfg  allowed_test_directories = test_unit,test_integration,test_api  ```If file with prefix `test_` is not in allowed directories list, it will raisean error:```shelltests/test_models.py:0:1: FP003 File tests/test_models.py is in the wrong directory.Allowed directories: test_unit,test_integration,test_api,test_migration```3) validates that test function has a not too complicated signature. Allowed numberof arguments for test can be configured in `setup.cfg` file:  ```cfg  allowed_test_arguments_count = 6  ```If test function has too complex signature, it will raise an error:```shelltests/test_integration/test_models.py:64:1: FP004 test_save_method has too complexsignature. Allowed count of arguments is 6```4) validates that test function has a not too complicated assertion block.Allowed number of asserts for test can be configured in `setup.cfg` file:  ```cfg  allowed_assert_count = 6  ```If test function has too complex assertion block, it will raise an error:```shelltests/test_integration/test_models.py:64:1: FP005 test_save_method hastoo many assert statements. Allowed count of asserts is 6```5) validates that `xfail` decorator has until argument.Until argument must be specified as a valid `datetime.date` valueand not older than the current date. For example:`@pytest.mark.xfail(reason='Test', until=date(2020, 9, 7))`If `xfail` does not have such mark, flake8 will raise an error:```shelltests/test_unit/test_utils.py:128:1: FP006 xfail mark has wrong format.It should has `until` argument```in case you forgot to specify `until` argument```shelltests/test_unit/test_utils.py:128:1: FP007 xfail mark has wrong format.It should has `until` argument with datetime.date type```in case you specified it in wrong format```shelltests/test_unit/test_utils.py:128:1: FP008 stale xfail mark```in case you have too old `xfail` mark6) validates that test function uses unique names7) validates that test function uses `pytest.mark.usefixtures`for those fixtures, which are not directly referenced in test bodyFor example, checking this function```python# file: test_something.pydef test_something(fixture_one, fixture_two):    assert fixture_two.some_attribute is not None```would raise:```shelltests/test_unit/test_something.py:2:0: FP010 test_something should use fixturesas follows: @pytest.mark.usefixtures('fixture_one')```## Installation```terminalpip install flake8-fine-pytest```## ExampleSample file:```python# test.py@pytest.mark.xfail(reason='')def test_xfail() -&gt; None:    pass@pytest.mark.xfaildef test_xfail() -&gt; None:    pass```Usage:```terminal$ flake8 test.pytest.py:1:1: FP001 xfailed test with empty reasontest.py:5:1: FP002 xfailed test without reason```## ContributingWe would love you to contribute to our project. It's simple:1. Create an issue with bug you found or proposal you have.   Wait for approve from maintainer.1. Create a pull request. Make sure all checks are green.1. Fix review comments if any.1. Be awesome.Here are useful tips:- You can run all checks and tests with `make check`.  Please do it before CI does.- We use [BestDoctor python styleguide](https://github.com/best-doctor/guides/blob/master/guides/en/python_styleguide.md).- We respect [Django CoC](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/).  Make soft, not bullshit.</longdescription>

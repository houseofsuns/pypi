Therefore,its setup is reasonably straightforward. First, it needs to be added to your service requirements,and then it will be installed alongside requirements of the service.If the service you intend to use is either the LMS or CMS, then the library is installed alongsidetheir requirements since the Maple release.Getting Help************Documentation=============See `documentation on Read the Docs &lt;https://openedx-events.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`_.More Help=========If you're having trouble, we have discussion forums athttps://discuss.openedx.org where you can connect with others in thecommunity.Our real-time conversations are on Slack.

All enhancements and patches to openedx_events will be documented   in this file.  It adheres to the structure of https://keepachangelog.com/ ,   but in reStructuredText instead of Markdown (for ease of incorporation into   Sphinx documentation and the PyPI description).   This project adheres to Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)... There should always be an &quot;Unreleased&quot; section for changes pending release.Unreleased----------[7.3.0] - 2023-05-15--------------------Changed~~~~~~~* Made `signal` argument optional in consume_events in preparation for removal[7.2.0] - 2023-05-03--------------------Changed~~~~~~~* Added event type as namespace to generated Avro schemas[7.1.0] - 2023-05-03--------------------Added~~~~~* Configurable loader for consumer side of Event Bus in ``openedx_events.event_bus``.* Added management command to load configured consumer and start worker.Changed~~~~~~~* Switch from ``edx-sphinx-theme`` to ``sphinx-book-theme`` since the former is  deprecated.

This will enable event bus consumers to send the event signal with the same metadata fields that were used when the event was produced.Fixed~~~~~* Updated time metadata to include UTC timezone.

Previously the `user_id` (guid) was the default field - see below for details on how to revert to `user_id` if needed.`MIGRATE_EMAIL_USER_ON_LOGIN` logic has been removed.## Installation`pip install django-staff-sso-client`## ConfigurationAdd the following to your settings file:```INSTALLED_APPS=[    [...]    'authbroker_client',]``````# authbroker configAUTHBROKER_URL = 'speak-to-webops-team-for-access'AUTHBROKER_CLIENT_ID = 'speak-to-webops-team-for-access'AUTHBROKER_CLIENT_SECRET = 'speak-to-webops-team-for-access'AUTHBROKER_STAFF_SSO_SCOPE = 'any-additional-scope-values'AUTHBROKER_ANONYMOUS_PATHS = (Tuple/list of paths that should be unprotected)AUTHBROKER_ANONYMOUS_URL_NAMES = (list of url names that should be unprotected)```Add the `'authbroker_client.backends.AuthbrokerBackend'` authentication backend, e.g:```AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = [    'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',    'authbroker_client.backends.AuthbrokerBackend',]```Add the LOGIN_URL ( it must be '/auth/login' )```LOGIN_URL = reverse_lazy('authbroker_client:login')```Add the LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL for e.g.```LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = reverse_lazy('home_page')```Then finally add this to your main `urls.py` file:`path('auth/', include('authbroker_client.urls'))`or, if you're using Django&lt;2:`url('^auth/', include('authbroker_client.urls', namespace='authbroker', app_name='authbroker_client'))`You should now have an `/auth/login/` URL which directs users through the `staff-sso` login flow. Once a user isauthenticated via `staff-sso` (and chosen identify provider), they will be redirected back to your application.A local django user with a matching email address will then be logged in. The user entry will be created if it doesnot already exist in the database.Once authenticated, the user will be redirected to `settings.LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL`Use the django `@login_required` decorator to protect individual views, or if you want to protect all views use this middleware:```MIDDLEWARE = [    [...]    'authbroker_client.middleware.ProtectAllViewsMiddleware',]```## Change the default user id fieldStaff-sso maintains two unique user ids for each user: the `email_user_id` field, which is in an email format [NOTE: it is purely a unique id, not a valid email address] and the `user_id` field, which is a GUID.  By default (from version 3.0.0 onwards) django-staff-sso-client identifies users based on the `email_user_id` field.  This is the preferred option for most cases.  If however, you need to use the `user_id` field, then add this to your settings.py file:```AUTHBROKER_USE_USER_ID_GUID = True```When creating new users django-staff-sso-client attempts to store the user id in the `User.USERNAME_FIELD` field.  With the stock django model this will be the `username` field.  If you use a custom user model you can override this field as needed, for example:```class YourCustomUserModel(...):  USERNAME_FIELD = 'sso_email_id'```NOTE: As per django's documentation, the `USERNAME_FIELD` should be the user model's primary key.## Change the user creation mappingHere's an example staff-sso profile, which is available at the point of user creation:```{    'user_id': '6fa3b542-9a6f-4fc3-a248-168596572999',       'email_user_id': 'john.smith-6fa3b542@id.trade.gov.uk',        'email': 'john.smith@someplace.gov.uk',    'contact_email': 'john.smith@someemail.com',    'related_emails': [   'jsmith@someotherplace.com',                          'me@johnsmith.com'],      'first_name': 'John',    'last_name': 'Smith',                    'groups': [ ... ],                        'permitted_applications': [ ... ],    'access_profiles': [ ... ]}```The default mapping is:```{      'email': profile['email'],      'first_name': profile['first_name'],      'last_name': profile['last_name'],}```You can change this default mapping by subclassing the authentication backend `authbroker_client.backends.AuthbrokerBackend` and overriding the `user_create_mapping` method.Here's an example:```from authbroker_client.backends import AuthbrokerBackendclass CustomAuthbrokerBackend(AuthbrokerBackend):    def user_create_mapping(self, profile):        return {            &quot;is_active&quot;: True,            &quot;first_name&quot;: profile[&quot;first_name&quot;],            &quot;last_name&quot;: profile[&quot;last_name&quot;],        }```### Exclude page from SSO Auth checkIn order to allow anonymous access to a page on a site protected using this client, add the following setting to your Django settings file:```AUTHBROKER_ANONYMOUS_PATHS = ('anonymous/path',)```Alternatively, you can use the `AUTHBROKER_ANONYMOUS_URL_NAMES` setting to specify a list of url names.```AUTHBROKER_ANONYMOUS_URL_NAMES = ('url-name',)```## Use with UKTrade mock-sso packageIt is possible to configure this package to work with the [mock-sso service](https://github.com/uktrade/mock-sso).Mock SSO requires that you provide a non-standard parameter in the query string of the initial GET call of the OAuth flow. (See the [mock-sso docs](https://github.com/uktrade/mock-sso/blob/master/README.md) for more detail.)This parameter is called `code`. Any services which use THIS library (django-mock-sso-client) could need to undertake automated tests of a stack which uses Staff SSO for downstream components (example: testing an app which in return requires access to another service's API, both of which use SSO for authentication).For circumstances like these you will need to prime mock-sso with this `code` parameter.This is achieved by changing the Django settings for the app which is importing THIS library. In those settings, add:```TEST_SSO_PROVIDER_SET_RETURNED_ACCESS_TOKEN = 'someCode'```where 'someCode' will then be provided as the 'access token' during the OAuth callback to mock-sso. (Again, see the [mock-sso docs](https://github.com/uktrade/mock-sso/blob/master/README.md) for more detail.)</longdescription>

	<longdescription>Overview========``cloudcix`` is a Python client for the CloudCIX REST API for rapidly building secure, scalable CloudCIX applications.For more information about CloudCIX, see `here &lt;http://www.cix.ie/#/services/saas&gt;`__.Installation------------Prerequisites~~~~~~~~~~~~~1. Create an account on the CloudCIX Platform   - `Register &lt;https://saas.cloudcix.com/auth/register&gt;`__2. Retrieve your API Key   - Under the ``My Membership`` tab in the sidebar, click on ``Member Details``   - The ``API Key`` should be available at the top of the form3. Ensure that you have both Python and pip installed   - As of right now, the ``cloudcix`` module is available at different versions for Python2 and Python3   - We recommend you use Python3 and the latest version of the ``cloudcix`` module   - `Python &lt;http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/&gt;`__   - `pip &lt;https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/&gt;`__Installing the ``cloudcix`` library~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The cloudcix library is installed using the ``pip`` module.Depending on your version of Python, you need to install different versions of ``cloudcix``- Python3   - ``pip3 install -U cloudcix``- Python2   - ``pip install -U 'cloudcix&lt;0.3'``The 0.2 releases are the last to support Python2.If you still use Python2 we recommend you upgrade to Python3 as support will be dropped for these versions in time.Required settings~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In order to run a project, the module requires some settings to exist.The variables required are as follows:- ``CLOUDCIX_API_URL``  - The base url of the Python2 API  - Usually ``https://api.cloudcix.com/`` but could change over time- ``CLOUDCIX_API_V2_URL``  - The API name is prepended to this url after the https:// for the Python3 API.   - Usually ``https://api.cloudcix.com/`` but could change over time- ``CLOUDCIX_API_VERSION`` = 2  - The version of the api- ``CLOUDCIX_API_USERNAME``  - The email of the account that you signed up with- ``CLOUDCIX_API_PASSWORD``  - The password associated with your CloudCIX account- ``CLOUDCIX_API_KEY``  - The API key associated with your CloudCIX Member (see **Prerequisites**)These variables can be declared in a settings file, as follows.. code:: python    # In main python script    import os    os.environ.setdefault('CLOUDCIX_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'my_project.my_settings').. code:: python    # In my_project/my_settings.py    CLOUDCIX_API_URL = 'https://api.cloudcix.com/'    CLOUDCIX_API_V2_URL = CLOUDCIX_API_URL    CLOUDCIX_API_USERNAME = 'EMAIL'               # CloudCIX login    CLOUDCIX_API_PASSWORD = 'PASSWORD'            # CloudCIX password    CLOUDCIX_API_KEY = 'NUMBER/CHARACTER STRING'  # CloudCIX api key    CLOUDCIX_API_VERSION = 2                      # CloudCIX versionExamples--------See `here &lt;https://cloudcix.github.io/python-cloudcix/examples.html&gt;`_ for examples on how to use this library.</longdescription>

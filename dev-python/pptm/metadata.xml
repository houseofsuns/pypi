The documentation is updated and published as a [Github project page ](https://pages.github.com/) automatically as part each release.### ReleasingTrigger the [Draft release workflow](https://github.com/Michael-Cohen/ppt/actions/workflows/draft_release.yml)(press _Run workflow_). This will update the changelog &amp; version and create a GitHub release which is in _Draft_ state.Find the draft release from the[GitHub releases](https://github.com/Michael-Cohen/ppt/releases) and publish it. When a release is published, it'll trigger [release](https://github.com/Michael-Cohen/ppt/blob/master/.github/workflows/release.yml) workflow which creates PyPI release and deploys updated documentation.### Pre-commitPre-commit hooks run all the auto-formatters (e.g. `black`, `isort`), linters (e.g. `mypy`, `flake8`), and other quality checks to make sure the changeset is in good shape before a commit/push happens.Install `pre-commit` with:```shpoetry add pre-commit```You can then install the hooks with (runs for each commit):```shpre-commit install```Or if you want them to run only for each push:```shpre-commit install -t pre-push```Or if you want e.g. want to run all checks manually for all files:```shpre-commit run --all-files```Because the pre-commit includes a hook for commit messages (`commitizen`), you should also run:```shpre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg ```---This project was generated using the [wolt-python-package-cookiecutter](https://github.com/woltapp/wolt-python-package-cookiecutter) template.</longdescription>

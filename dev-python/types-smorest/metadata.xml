	<longdescription># types-smorestThis is a package containing type annotations for [flask-smorest](https://pypi.org/project/flask-smorest/).### Installing:Simply run the following in the environment in which you want to install this package:```shell# install types-smorest$ python -m pip install types-smorest```or add it to your requirements file.### DevelopingThis is a partial stub package, only covering a part of the functions and objects available in `flask-smorest`.Contributions (both in adding stubs for more functions, or keeping up to date with `flask-smorest` itself) are welcome.All the formatting is done using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/). To use this, run the following:```shell# install pre-commit$ python -m pip install pre-commit# Set up the hooks (so pre-commit automatically runs when you do a commit)$ cd root/directory/of/the/pulled/repository$ pre-commit install# This will run automatically whenever a commit is created# To run it manually, use:$ pre-commit run --all-files```</longdescription>

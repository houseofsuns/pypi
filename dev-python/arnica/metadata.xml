	<longdescription># ARNICA or  All Recurrent No-brainers In Cerfacs Applications We keep there all the simple little things we regularly need, to ease the pain.For example a cartesian-to-cylindrical conversion around x-axis, with a specific convention ```pythondef rtheta2yz(rrr, theta):    &quot;&quot;&quot; return yz fror rtheta ,    theta in  radians measure of ange in the yz plane,    - range -pi/pi    - 0 on the y+ axis (z=0, y&gt;0)    spanning -pi to pi                        0pi=0deg                      Y                      ^                      |                      |    -0.5pi=-90deg     o------&gt;Z   0.5pi=90deg    &quot;&quot;&quot;    yyy = rrr * np.cos(theta)    zzz = rrr * np.sin(theta)    return yyy, zzz```Ok trivial, but I did mention it was a no-brainer no?Having these bits in a single repository adds the following values:- Unitary testing.- linting.- Automatic documentation.- Can be used by others in Cerfacs.In Arnica, useful features related to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) are implemented, namely:  1. *CFD related tools* aiming to be used together with the Reactive software suite [AVBP](http://www.cerfacs.fr/avbp7x/).  2. *CFD related bare functionnalities* such as ParaView-readable XDMF writers from Numpy arrays, axi-symetric shell generators, 2D finite differences solvers, _etc._  Contributors are, for the moment, the CERFACS/[COOP Team](http://cerfacs.fr/coop/team/) that can be reached at [coop@cerfacs.fr](coop@cerfacs.fr).Documentation is available on internal Forge [arnica at Nitrox](http://open-source.pg.cerfacs.fr/arnica) or on [arnica at ReadTheDocs](https://arnica.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).Source code is hoster on internal Forge [arnica at Nitrox](https://nitrox.cerfacs.fr/open-source/arnica), where all the devops occur.It is then mirrored at [arnica at gitlab.com/cerfacs](https://gitlab.com/cerfacs/arnica)If you are willing to contribute, please read carefully the guide in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.# InstallationArnica can be installed directly in your Python 3 environnement by running the command:```pip install arnica```This command will install Arnica and all its dependencies (if needed). Once this step is over you can use arnica as a Python module in a script:```pythonimport arnica```# LicenseCeCILL-B FREE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT</longdescription>

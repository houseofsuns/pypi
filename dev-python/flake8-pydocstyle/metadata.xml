In my use-case I wanted to keep the configuration in the `pyproject.toml` file and be able to use everything that `pydocstyle` has to offer in terms of customization. The `flake8-docstrings` is not reading the `pydocstyle` config files, but provides its own options which was insufficient to me.## ContributingIf you wish to contribute feel free to create an issue or just straight away fork and create PR to this repository. To save your and my time on discussions please provide a good description for them.## DevelopmentDevelopment documentation can be found [here](README-DEV.md)</longdescription>

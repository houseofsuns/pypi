	<longdescription># natural_time v1A parser for understanding date-times written in a variety of formatsThere are many great tools for interpreting dates and times when the format is known, however the aim of this project is to be able to interpret dates and times from much more fuzzy situations (e.g. Tomorrow afternoon at 3) as well as be able to extract the date or time from a sentence (e.g. I have an appointment at 6pm)Has capability to understand both relative times (e.g. in 5 days) and absolute times (e.g tomorrow at 5pm)This package can be installed using: pip install natural_timeHow to use:  1) Import the package using: import natural_time  2) Run the function: natural_time.natural_time(&quot;Your_String_Here&quot;)  3) Thats it (the natural_time function returns the date as datetime object)If you find examples of phrases that don't interpret correcly raise an issue via github and I'll work on incorporating it, you are welcome to also make contributions to the code.</longdescription>

In many cases, it is critical to process the resulting large volumes of data on a regular schedule and alert system operators when the system has changed. Automated quality control and performance monitoring can allow system operators to quickly detect performance issues.  Pecos is an open source Python package designed to address this need. Pecos includes built-in functionality to monitor performance of time series data, subject to a series of quality control tests. The Python package includes methods to run quality control tests defined by the user and generate reports which include performance metrics, test results, and graphics. The software was developed specifically for solar photovoltaic system monitoring, but is designed to be used for a wide range of applications.

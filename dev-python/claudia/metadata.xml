	<longdescription># ClaudiaClaudia is a CLI helper utility that allows users to perform XRPL specific tasks both locally and on other public networks. Both macOS and Ubuntu are supported. Currently, there is no support for Windows.Claudia provides users a seamless CLI experience. There are a lot of commands which support a lot of options. It also offers a _demo_ mode, which can help reduce typing efforts significantly. You would mostly navigate a pre-built menu using `↑ ↓` and `↵` keys. Minimal typing will be required. Both CLI and demo modes offer the same functionality.Some important tasks that can be performed using Claudia are listed below:- Build rippled from local code- Install rippled from pre-built binaries released by Ripple- Manage a local-mainnet network using local rippled instance- Manage a local-sidechain network- Build a local witness server using local code- Run unit tests on the built/installed rippled instance- Run E2E tests on local-mainnet, local-sidechain, devnet and testnet network- Manage rippled features on the local-mainnet and local-sidechain networks------## General PrerequisitesPlease have the following installed on your machine before proceeding further:- [Python3](https://www.python.org/)  - Run ```python3 --version``` to check if Python3 is already installed.   - If Python3 is not installed, please install it using the official [Python installer](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  - Verify installation by running: ```python3 --version```- [pip3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)  - Run ```pip3 --version``` to check if Python3 is already installed.   - If pip3 is not installed, follow the next steps:    - macOS:       - ```python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade```    - Linux:      - ```sudo apt update```      - ```sudo apt install python3-pip```    - Verify installation by running: ```pip3 --version```- [docker](https://www.docker.com/)  - Run ```docker --version``` to check if docker is already installed.  - If docker is not installed, follow the next steps:    - macOS:      - Download and then run the [Docker Desktop installer for macOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/).    - Linux:      - Download and then run the [Docker Desktop installer for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/).-  _Following is **ONLY** required if you intend to run Javascript e2e tests:_   - [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download)     -  Run ```node --version``` to check if node is already installed.     -  If node is not installed, follow the next steps:        - macOS:          - ```brew install node```        - Linux:           - ```curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash - &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install -y nodejs```   - [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/download)     - Run ```npm -v``` to check if npm ia already installed.      - If npm in not installed, follow the next steps:       - macOS:         - ```brew install npm```       - Linux:         - ```sudo apt install npm```- Clone [rippled](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled) code, if you intend to build rippled locally and/or manage/test a sidechain network.  - If you intend to use sidechain functionality, please use [this](https://github.com/seelabs/rippled/tree/xbridge) rippled fork instead.- Clone [XBridge Witness](https://github.com/seelabs/xbridge_witness) code, if you intend to build witness server locally and/or manage/test the sidechain network.------## InstallationInstall claudia from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/claudia/), by running:       pip3 install claudia------## UsageFollowing are some important tasks you can perform with Claudia.

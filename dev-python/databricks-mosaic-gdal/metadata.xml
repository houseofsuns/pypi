	<longdescription># PyPI Project 'databricks-mosaic-gdal' Overview&gt; Current version is 3.4.3 (to match GDAL).This is a filetree (vs apt based) drop-in packaging of GDAL with Java Bindings for Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa) which is used by [Databricks Runtime](https://docs.databricks.com/release-notes/runtime/releases.html) (DBR) 11.3+. 1. `gdal-3.4.3-filetree.tar.xz` is ~50MB - it is extracted with `tar -xf gdal-3.4.3-filetree.tar.xz -C /`2. `gdal-3.4.3.-symlinks.tar.xz` is ~19MB - it is extracted with `tar -xhf gdal-3.4.3-symlinks.tar.xz -C /`An [init script](https://docs.databricks.com/clusters/init-scripts.html) based approach is provided at [gdal-3.4.3-filetree-init.sh](https://github.com/databrickslabs/mosaic/blob/main/modules/python/gdal_package/databricks-mosaic-gdal/resources/scripts/mosaic-gdal-3.4.3-filetree-init.sh) for managing install of the tarballs across a DBR cluster with install from PyPI.Starting in version `3.4.3.post5`, handling tarball unpacking without requiring an init script through [cluster library](https://docs.databricks.com/libraries/cluster-libraries.html#cluster-installed-library) vs a notebook scoped is being tested. __Use the init script if you run into issues.__ __Requirements:__* This will not install the GDAL tarballs if not on Databricks Runtime &gt;= 11.3* Added benefit of not accidentally installing on your local machine which would be bad since it unpacks to root (`/`)* This is deployed to pypi without a wheel (WHL) to avoid uneccessary duplication of the resource files and to trigger `setup.py` building on install __Notes:__* This is a very specific packaging for GDAL + dependencies which removes any libraries that are already provided by DBR, so it __will not be not useful outside Databricks.__* It additionally includes GDAL shared objects (`.so`) for Java Bindings, GDAL 3.4.3 Python bindings, and tweak for OSGEO as currently supplied by [UbuntuGIS PPA](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntugis/+archive/ubuntu/ubuntugis-unstable) based init script [install-gdal-databricks.sh](https://github.com/databrickslabs/mosaic/blob/main/src/main/resources/scripts/install-gdal-databricks.sh) provided by Mosaic. __This install replaces the existing way on Mosaic, so choose one or the other.__* The GDAL JAR for 3.4 is not included but is provided by Mosaic itself and added to your Databricks cluster as part of the [enable_gdal](https://databrickslabs.github.io/mosaic/usage/install-gdal.html#enable-gdal-for-a-notebook) called when configuring Mosaic for GDAL. Separately, the JAR could be added as a [cluster-installed library](https://docs.databricks.com/libraries/cluster-libraries.html#cluster-installed-library), e.g. through Maven coordinates `org.gdal:gdal:3.4.0` from [mvnrepository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.gdal/gdal/3.4.0).* Don't use versions below `3.4.3.post5` - __This is still being developed / refined.____Install:___Install 'databricks-mosaic-gdal' from PyPI as a [cluster library](https://docs.databricks.com/libraries/cluster-libraries.html#cluster-installed-library) vs a notebook scoped.__Install 'databricks-mosaic' from PyPI in a notebook or as a cluster library (handles JARs as well):_```# install in notebook e.g.%pip install databricks-mosaic```_Then you can initialize:_```import mosaic as mosmos.enable_mosaic(spark, dbutils)mos.enable_gdal(spark)```_Check Mosaic [GDAL Installation Guide](https://databrickslabs.github.io/mosaic/usage/install-gdal.html#) for updated instructions on/around APR 2023._</longdescription>

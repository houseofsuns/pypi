	<longdescription>Python UCI (Unified Configuration Interface) bindings=====================================================Bindings for OpenWRT configuration interface called UCI and specifically librarylibuci.You can use this library to access and set configuration from and to UCI.Requirements------------* Python3* libuciUsage-----There are two primary packages in this project. There is `uci` and `euci`. Inmost cases you want to use `euci` but because that is just a wrapper on top `uci`please also read documentation for that as features you might be missing in `euci`might be implemented there.### uciThis is Python3 module and real wrapper on top of libuci. Its API is designed tobe same as the official Lua bindings but given by differences between these twolanguages it is not completely same. Primarily some operations present in both aremore potent in pyuci.General usage consist of initializing `Uci` handler, calling methods to modify orreceive configuration values and then committing it.```pythonfrom uci import Uciu = Uci()print(u.get(&quot;network&quot;))u.set(&quot;network&quot;, &quot;lan&quot;, &quot;type&quot;, &quot;bridge&quot;)u.commit(&quot;network&quot;)````Uci` can also be used in Python `with` statement. This ensures that all changesdone to uci are committed on `with` statement context exit.```pythonwith uci.Uci() as u:u.set(&quot;network&quot;, &quot;lan&quot;, &quot;type&quot;, &quot;bridge&quot;)```#### uci.get(config, section, option)Use this method if you want to get configuration values. Arguments are identifyingwhat you want to get. `config` is name of top level configuration file to read.`section` is name of section (be aware that that is not type of section butvalue). `option` is name of option or list. Only required argument is `config`.This method returns different representations depending on number of providedarguments.When only `config` is provided then returned type is dictionary of dictionarieswith structure where first level keys are section values and values aredictionaries with section content. The lower dictionary keys are then names ofoptions and lists. Value of option key is string and value of list key is tuplecontaining strings.```{'lan': {'ifname': ('lan0', 'lan1', 'lan2', 'lan3', 'lan4'),         'ipaddr': '192.168.1.1',         'netmask': '255.255.255.0',         'proto': 'static',         'type': 'bridge'}, 'wan': {'ifname': 'eth2', 'proto': 'dhcp'}}```Note that Python3 ensures order in dictionaries and order in these are ensured tobe same as in configuration file. This is important for sections where order isused to specify priority between for example rules.When `section` and optionally also `option` are provided then only that specificvalue is returned. In case of no `option` then type of section is returned asstring. If `option` is provided then it depends if it refers to list or to option.If it is option then returned value is of string type. If it is list then tuple ofstring is returned instead.If any requested config, section or option are not found then`UciExceptionNotFound` is thrown.#### uci.get_all(config, section, option)This is almost same as `uci.get` with only one difference. That is if you provideonly `config` and `section` then instead of getting section type it returns lowerdictionary same as if you provide only `config`. That is it returns dictionarywith all options and lists in that section.#### uci.set(config, section, option, value)Set given `value` to given option. Value has to be either string or table/tuple ofstrings. If you provide string then value is set as option. If you providetable/tuple then it is set as list. Note that it replaces previous value.Note that section has to exists otherwise UciException is thrown.This also allows you to set name for section (to create named section or changename). Format of this function to be used for this is: `uci.set(config, section,value)`.#### uci.add(...)This is suppose to add new anonymous section. This is currently not implementedand thus adding anonymous sections with pyuci is not supported.#### uci.delete(config, section, option)This method allows you to remove sections and options from configuration. `config`and `section` are required. `option` is optional.No error is reported if config, section or option does not exist.Note that `section` in reality can be left out as well but in such case UCI doesnothing and no error is reported.#### uci.rename(config, section, option, name)This method allows you to rename existing option, list or section to differentname. `option` is optional and in such case section type is modified.#### uci.reorder(config, section, index)Move given section to different index in configuration file. All arguments arerequired and `index` starts with 0.#### uci.save(config, section, option)Save changes deltas to save location. This does not modify configuration if selfbut stores changes to specific configuration location. Using such delta you canoverlay configuration. See `uci.savedir()`, `uci.set_savedir()` and `uci`initialization on how to set location for this delta save.#### uci.commit(config, section, option)Write changes to configuration files. You have to specify at least `config` butyou can also optionally specify more precise specification of `section` and`option`. This ensures that anything outside of that specification is not writtento configuration.#### uci.revert(config, section, option)Drops all changes done on specified configuration. `config` argument is requiredand `section` and `option` are optional and allows you to limit what is suppose tobe reverted.#### uci.list_configs()Returns list of all configs loaded and available to `Uci`.#### uci.confdir()Returns path to current configuration directory. This is directory whereconfiguration files are stored. This is suppose to be on permanent storage.To set it you can either call `uci.set_confdir()` or to pass keyword `confdir`argument to `Uci` initialization.#### uci.set_confdir(path)Sets given `path` as to be used as configuration directory. That is directorythat is used to load configuration from and store it to.To get current configuration directory you can call `uci.confdir()`.#### uci.savedir()Returns path to current save directory. This is directory where delta files arestored to. Those are changes done to configuration but not committed toconfiguration directory yet. To update content of this directory you can call`uci.save()`.To set it you can either call `uci.set_savedir()` or to pass keyword `savedir`argument to `Uci` initialization.#### uci.set_savedir(path)Sets given `path` as to be used as save directory. That is directory that is usedto store delta files. Those are files with configuration changes that are notwritten to configuration files in configuration directory.To get current save directory you can call `uci.savedir()`.### euci (extended uci)This is Python only extension for `uci` module. It extends `Uci` to `EUci` andadds functionality like types to it.General usage is same as in case of `Uci`. Every method you have in `Uci` you havealso access trough `EUci`. The only difference is that some methods are overloadedand provide additional behavior on top of `Uci`.`EUci` supports following types explicitly and any type that can be initializedfrom string without additional info (such as __int__ or __float__):* __str__: this is default and native UCI type.* __bool__: this is boolean type that has only two states: `True` or `False`.  UCI defines special strings that are suppose to be understood by all  applications as booleans. Those are `0`, `no`, `off`, `false` and `disabled`  for `False` and `1`, `yes`, `on`, `true`, `enabled` for `True`. Any other  value in configuration is considered as invalid. `EUci` uses `0` and `1` if it  sets this type.#### euci.bolean.VALUESThis is dictionary mapping boolean strings to `True` or `False`.Useful when getting whole config section and processing options individually.#### euci.get(config, section, option, dtype=str, convert=None, list=False, default=NoDefault)This is overloaded `uci.get` method. Three initial positional arguments are sameas in case of `uci.get` but behavior changes depending on additional keywordarguments.`dtype` is type that can be initialized from string passed as a single argument.It ensures that returned value is always of given type. For list of supportedtypes please see previous section. The UciExceptionNotFound is raised if valuecan't be converted to specified type.`convert` can be a function that is called to do custom conversion. You can usethis if simple dtype is not enough for you. The reason for using this is toconvert to custom type or to provide additional info such as base to integer.The function should accept value to convert as argument and return result.`list` is bool specifying if `euci.get` should ensure that returned value isconsidered as UCI option or as list. This is effectively difference betweenreturning value of `dtype` or tuple of `dtype` values. If configuration containsUCI option with appropriate name but `list` is set to `True` then `euci.get`returns tuple with value of that option. On the other hand if configurationcontains UCI list with appropriate name but `list` is set to `False` then`euci.get` returns always value of type `dtype`. It returns first one ifmultiple UCI lists were provided. The default is `False` so you should alwaysspecify it as `True` when you are working with lists. Note that this keywordhas no effect if `section` is not provided. Meaning that in such casedictionary is always returned.`default` keyword argument can be used to suppress exception`UciExceptionNotFound`. Instead of raising this exception `euci.get` returnsprovided default. Note that default is never processed by conversion, so youhave to make sure that it is already of correct type or expect that it is mightnot be. This has no effect if no `section` argument is provided. Meaning thatreturned dictionary never contains anything else than strings as values.#### euci.set(config, section, option, value)This is overloaded `uci.set` method. It is not changed in form of how it iscalled. You should not see any difference with exception of how it handles`value`. It detects provided type of `value` argument and if it is one ofsupported types then it converts it correctly to appropriate stringrepresentation. Any unsupported type is considered to be string and stringconversion is performed.`value` can be both only single value or tuple/list same as in case of `uci.set`.In case of tuple/list it is expected that all values are of same type. That ishandled in way that value at index zero is used to detect type and rest of thevalues are converted to that type.### ExamplesThese are examples of different usage of `uci` and `euci` on OpenWRT system.#### Getting configured host nameHostname is in anonymous section of type `system`. We have to check all sectionsto get correct name for that section.```pythonfrom euci import EUcihostname = next(    u.get(&quot;system&quot;, section, &quot;hostname&quot;)    for section in u.get(&quot;system&quot;)    if u.get(&quot;system&quot;, section) == &quot;system&quot;))```Testing-------To run tests you need, on top of requirements, pytest.You can use Docker to get appropriate environment for running tests (with pytestand including libuci). Appropriate docker file can be found in this repositorywith name `.Dockerfile`.Running all tests is as easy as running: `python3 -m pytest tests`</longdescription>

With Examples  - The package was created with the intention of being as easy to use as possbile.  - To that extent, there are 4 basic usage examples and over 10 advanced usage examples.- Complex When Required  - The default is simplicity, but the package can step up when required to do so.  - Any actions outside of the simple scenario of getting an optional string value should    be relatively easy to request of the package API.- Hierarchically Aware  - By default, uses the `.` character in the property names to define levels of hierarchy.  - Hierarchy levels can be used to find only those properties that exist under a    given hierarchy.  - If desired, the `ApplicationPropertiesFacade` object can be used to restrict access    to only those properties that exist under a given hierarchy.- Command Line Aware  - The `set_manual_property` function allows for one or more individual properties to be    supplied by the command line.- Extensible  - The loading of the properties is separate from access to the values for those properties.  - Due to the separation of the loading and accessing parts of the library, custom loading    classes can be added with ease.    - Current loading classes include loaders for Json files, with Simple Property files right      around the corner## RequirementsThis project required Python 3.8 or later to function.## Installation```shpip install application_properties```## How To Use This PackageThe primary goal of this package is to provide a simple, easy to use interfaceto access properties within a Python script or program.  It is our contentionthat 80% or more of general usage of such a package will be focused on twoelements:- loading a group of properties from a file that is properly formatted  for a given format- accessing a specific string property, possibly with a default, from the that  property store### ExamplesFor concrete examples that show the power of this library package, please consultthe [Examples Document](./docs/examples.md).  If you come up with a normal exampleof how to use our package that we have missed, or come up with a novel example ofhow to use our package, please file an issue using the process below and let usknow. From our experience, one example can often paint a picture of how to use ourproject that is difficult to explain clearly with just words.## Issues and Future PlansIf you would like to report an issue with the library or the documentation, pleasefile an issue [using GitHub](https://github.com/jackdewinter/application_properties/issues).Please remember to fill in as much information as possible including a good, repeatablepattern for reproducing the issue.  Do not overflow us with too much information,but provide us with enough information to make the problem evident to us.If you would like to us to implement a feature that you believe is important, pleasefile an issue [using GitHub](https://github.com/jackdewinter/application_properties/issues)that includes what you want to add, why you want to add it, and why it is importantto you, and how you think it will help others.  We truly want to listen to whatyou see as a good feature, so please do not be upset if we say &quot;no&quot; or &quot;let methink about it&quot;.Please note that the issue you file will usually be the start of a conversation,so be ready for more questions.  If you have any Python developer skills, pleasemention that as well.  The conversations about &quot;hey, can you...&quot; is a lot differentthan &quot;if I do... can I add it to the project?&quot;.## When Did Things Change?The changelog for this project is maintained [at this location](/changelog.md).## Still Have Questions?If you still have questions, please consult our[Frequently Asked Questions](/docs/faq.md) document.## Instructions For ContributingDeveloper notes on various topics are kept in the the[Developer Notes](/docs/developer.md) document.If you attempting to contribute something to this project,please follow the steps outlined in the[CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md) file.</longdescription>

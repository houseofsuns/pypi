	<longdescription># imgo## Process, Augment, and Balance Image Data[![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/imgo.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/imgo/)[![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/imgo.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/imgo/)[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-C06524)](https://github.com/celerygemini/imgo/blob/main/LICENSE)## 💡 What is it?This library is designed to facilitate the preprocessing phase of image classification projects in order to get into the fun part: training the models!### Features:Imgo is composed of two modules: **uptools** and **augtools**.**Uptools** helps to streamline various image data preprocessing tasks, such as: - Reading images from a local disk - Rescaling images - Normalizing and standardizing pixel values - Converting image datasets into numpy-arrays - One-hot-encoding label data - Splitting image datasets into training, validation, and testing subsets - Merging data subsets into a single dataset - Saving numpy-arrays as images in class subdirectories ![imgo_up_demo](aux/imgo_up_demo.jpg) **Augtools** allows the user to quickly and efficiently apply augmentation to image data. With Augtools, users can perform the following augmentation tasks using very few lines of code: - Apply a powerful collection of transformation and corruption functions - Augment images saved on a local disk - Save augmented images in class subdirectories - Augment entire image datasets - Augment training data in place in preparation for machine learning projects - Rebalance class sizes by generating new training images![imgo_aug_demo](aux/imgo_aug_demo.jpg)## 🛠️ Setup Install it from **PyPI** by running `pip install imgo`.### Dependencies The code was written with **Python 3.6**, and it is recommended to run it in a virtual environment. All the required libraries are listed in the `requirements.txt` file in this repo.## 🚀 ExecutionOnce the package has been installed, it is simply a case of experimenting with the various classes and functions. For a quickstart, please see the [demo](https://github.com/celerygemini/imgo/tree/master/demos).## 📝 DocumentationDocumentation is currently available in the form of docstrings.## ⚖️ LicenseThe project is licensed under the MIT license.### AcknowledgementsSome of the **augtools** library is built as a wrapper around **Imgaug**, a powerful image augmentation library.

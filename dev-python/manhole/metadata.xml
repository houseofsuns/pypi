	<longdescription>========Overview========Features========* Uses unix domain sockets, only root or same effective user can connect.* Can run the connection in a thread or in a signal handler (see ``oneshot_on`` option).* Can start the thread listening for connections from a signal handler (see ``activate_on`` option)* Compatible with apps that fork, reinstalls the Manhole thread after fork - had to monkeypatch os.fork/os.forkpty for  this.* Compatible with gevent and eventlet with some limitations - you need to either:  * Use ``oneshot_on``, *or*  * Disable thread monkeypatching (eg: ``gevent.monkey.patch_all(thread=False)``, ``eventlet.monkey_patch(thread=False)``  Note: on eventlet `you might &lt;https://github.com/eventlet/eventlet/issues/401&gt;`_ need to setup the hub first to prevent  circular import problems:  .. sourcecode:: python    import eventlet    eventlet.hubs.get_hub()  # do this first    eventlet.monkey_patch(thread=False)* The thread is compatible with apps that use signalfd (will mask all signals for the Manhole threads).Options-------.. code-block:: python    manhole.install(        verbose=True,        verbose_destination=2,        patch_fork=True,        activate_on=None,        oneshot_on=None,        sigmask=manhole.ALL_SIGNALS,        socket_path=None,        reinstall_delay=0.5,        locals=None,        strict=True,    )* ``verbose`` - Set it to ``False`` to squelch the logging.* ``verbose_destination`` - Destination for verbose messages. Set it to a file descriptor or handle. Default is  unbuffered stderr (stderr ``2`` file descriptor).* ``patch_fork`` - Set it to ``False`` if you don't want your ``os.fork`` and ``os.forkpy`` monkeypatched* ``activate_on`` - Set to ``&quot;USR1&quot;``, ``&quot;USR2&quot;`` or some other signal name, or a number if you want the Manhole thread  to start when this signal is sent. This is desirable in case you don't want the thread active all the time.* ``thread`` - Set to ``True`` to start the always-on ManholeThread. Default: ``True``.  Automatically switched to ``False`` if ``oneshot_on`` or ``activate_on`` are used.* ``oneshot_on`` - Set to ``&quot;USR1&quot;``, ``&quot;USR2&quot;`` or some other signal name, or a number if you want the Manhole to  listen for connection in the signal handler. This is desireable in case you don't want threads at all.* ``sigmask`` - Will set the signal mask to the given list (using ``signalfd.sigprocmask``). No action is done if  ``signalfd`` is not importable. **NOTE**: This is done so that the Manhole thread doesn't *steal* any signals;  Normally that is fine because Python will force all the signal handling to be run in the main thread but signalfd  doesn't.* ``socket_path`` - Use a specific path for the unix domain socket (instead of ``/tmp/manhole-&lt;pid&gt;``). This disables  ``patch_fork`` as children cannot reuse the same path.* ``reinstall_delay`` - Delay the unix domain socket creation *reinstall_delay* seconds. This alleviates  cleanup failures when using fork+exec patterns.* ``locals`` - Names to add to manhole interactive shell locals.* ``daemon_connection`` - The connection thread is daemonic (dies on app exit). Default: ``False``.* ``redirect_stderr`` - Redirect output from stderr to manhole console. Default: ``True``.* ``strict`` - If ``True`` then ``AlreadyInstalled`` will be raised when attempting to install manhole twice.  Default: ``True``.Environment variable installation---------------------------------Manhole can be installed via the ``PYTHONMANHOLE`` environment variable.This::    PYTHONMANHOLE='' python yourapp.pyIs equivalent to having this in ``yourapp.py``::    import manhole    manhole.install()Any extra text in the environment variable is passed to ``manhole.install()``. Example::    PYTHONMANHOLE='onshot_on=&quot;USR2&quot;' python yourapp.pyWhat happens when you actually connect to the socket----------------------------------------------------1. Credentials are checked (if it's same user or root)2. ``sys.__std*__``/``sys.std*`` are redirected to the UDS3. Stacktraces for each thread are written to the UDS4. REPL is started so you can fiddle with the processKnown issues============* Using threads and file handle (not raw file descriptor) ``verbose_destination`` can cause deadlocks. See bug reports:  `PyPy &lt;https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/1895&gt;`_ and `Python 3.4 &lt;http://bugs.python.org/issue22697&gt;`_.SIGTERM and socket cleanup--------------------------By default Python doesn't call the ``atexit`` callbacks with the default SIGTERM handling. This makes manhole leavestray socket files around. If this is undesirable you should install a custom SIGTERM handler so ``atexit`` isproperly invoked.Example:.. code-block:: python    import signal    import sys    def handle_sigterm(signo, frame):        sys.exit(128 + signo)  # this will raise SystemExit and cause atexit to be called    signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, handle_sigterm)Using Manhole with uWSGI------------------------Because uWSGI overrides signal handling Manhole is a bit more tricky to setup. One way is to use &quot;uWSGI signals&quot; (notthe POSIX signals) and have the workers check a file for the pid you want to open the Manhole in.Stick something this in your WSGI application file:.. sourcecode:: python    from __future__ import print_function    import sys    import os    import manhole    stack_dump_file = '/tmp/manhole-pid'    uwsgi_signal_number = 17    try:        import uwsgi        if not os.path.exists(stack_dump_file):            open(stack_dump_file, 'w')        def open_manhole(dummy_signum):            with open(stack_dump_file, 'r') as fh:                pid = fh.read().strip()                if pid == str(os.getpid()):                    inst = manhole.install(strict=False, thread=False)                    inst.handle_oneshot(dummy_signum, dummy_signum)        uwsgi.register_signal(uwsgi_signal_number, 'workers', open_manhole)        uwsgi.add_file_monitor(uwsgi_signal_number, stack_dump_file)        print(&quot;Listening for stack mahole requests via %r&quot; % (stack_dump_file,), file=sys.stderr)    except ImportError:        print(&quot;Not running under uwsgi; unable to configure manhole trigger&quot;, file=sys.stderr)    except IOError:        print(&quot;IOError creating manhole trigger %r&quot; % (stack_dump_file,), file=sys.stderr)    # somewhere bellow you'd have something like    from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application    application = get_wsgi_application()    # or    def application(environ, start_response):        start_response('200 OK', [('Content-Type', 'text/plain'), ('Content-Length', '2')])        yield b'OK'To open the Manhole just run `echo 1234 &gt; /tmp/manhole-pid` and then `manhole-cli 1234`.Requirements============:OS: Linux, OS X:Runtime: Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 or PyPySimilar projects================* Twisted's `manhole &lt;http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.conch.manhole.html&gt;`__ - it has colors and  server-side history.* `wsgi-shell &lt;https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/wsgi-shell&gt;`_ - spawns a thread.* `pyrasite &lt;https://github.com/lmacken/pyrasite&gt;`_ - uses gdb to inject code.* `pydbattach &lt;https://github.com/albertz/pydbattach&gt;`_ - uses gdb to inject code.* `pystuck &lt;https://github.com/alonho/pystuck&gt;`_ - very similar, uses `rpyc &lt;https://github.com/tomerfiliba/rpyc&gt;`_ for  communication.* `pyringe &lt;https://github.com/google/pyringe&gt;`_ - uses gdb to inject code, more reliable, but relies on `dbg` python  builds unfortunatelly.* `pdb-clone &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pdb-clone&gt;`_ - uses gdb to inject code, with a `different strategy  &lt;https://code.google.com/p/pdb-clone/wiki/RemoteDebugging&gt;`_.Changelog=========1.8.0 (2021-04-08)------------------* Simplified connection closing code.  Contributed by Anton Ryzhov in `#62 &lt;https://github.com/ionelmc/python-manhole/pull/62&gt;`_.* Made connection shutdown in ``manhole-cli`` more graceful.  Contributed by Anton Ryzhov in `#63 &lt;https://github.com/ionelmc/python-manhole/pull/63&gt;`_.1.7.0 (2021-03-22)------------------* Fixed memory leak via ``sys.last_type``, ``sys.last_value``, ``sys.last_traceback``.  Contributed by Anton Ryzhov in `#59 &lt;https://github.com/ionelmc/python-manhole/pull/59&gt;`_.* Fixed a bunch of double-close bugs and simplified stream handler code.  Contributed by Anton Ryzhov in `#58 &lt;https://github.com/ionelmc/python-manhole/pull/58&gt;`_.* Loosen up ``pid`` argument parsing in ``manhole-cli`` to allow using paths with any prefix  (not just ``/tmp``).1.6.0 (2019-01-19)------------------* Testing improvements (changed some skips to xfail, added osx in Travis).* Fixed long standing Python 2.7 bug where ``sys.getfilesystemencoding()`` would be broken after installing a threaded  manhole. See `#51 &lt;https://github.com/ionelmc/python-manhole/issues/51&gt;`_.* Dropped support for Python 2.6, 3.3 and 3.4.* Fixed handling when ``socket.setdefaulttimeout()`` is used.  Contributed by &quot;honnix&quot; in `#53 &lt;https://github.com/ionelmc/python-manhole/pull/53&gt;`_.* Fixed some typos. Contributed by Jesús Cea in `#43 &lt;https://github.com/ionelmc/python-manhole/pull/43&gt;`_.* Fixed handling in ``manhole-cli`` so that timeout is actually seconds and not milliseconds.  Contributed by Nir Soffer in `#45 &lt;https://github.com/ionelmc/python-manhole/pull/45&gt;`_.* Cleaned up useless polling options in ``manhole-cli``.  Contributed by Nir Soffer in `#46 &lt;https://github.com/ionelmc/python-manhole/pull/46&gt;`_.* Documented and implemented a solution for using Manhole with Eventlet.  See `#49 &lt;https://github.com/ionelmc/python-manhole/issues/49&gt;`_.1.5.0 (2017-08-31)------------------* Added two string aliases for ``connection_handler`` option. Now you can conveniently use ``connection_handler=&quot;exec&quot;``.* Improved ``handle_connection_exec``. It now has a clean way to exit (``exit()``) and properly closes the socket.1.4.0 (2017-08-29)------------------* Added the ``connection_handler`` install option. Default value is ``manhole.handle_connection_repl``, and alternate  ``manhole.handle_connection_exec`` is provided (very simple: no output redirection, no stacktrace dumping).* Dropped Python 3.2 from the test grid. It may work but it's a huge pain to support (pip/pytest don't support it anymore).* Added Python 3.5 and 3.6 in the test grid.* Fixed issues with piping to ``manhole-cli``. Now ``echo foobar | manhole-cli`` will wait 1 second for output from manhole  (you can customize this with the ``--timeout`` option).* Fixed issues with newer PyPy (caused by gevent/eventlet socket unwrapping).1.3.0 (2015-09-03)------------------* Allowed Manhole to be configured without any thread or activation (in case you want to manually activate).* Added an example and tests for using Manhole with uWSGi.* Fixed error handling in ``manhole-cli`` on Python 3 (exc vars don't leak anymore).* Fixed support for running in gevent/eventlet-using apps on Python 3 (now that they support Python 3).* Allowed reinstalling the manhole (in non-``strict`` mode). Previous install is undone.1.2.0 (2015-07-06)------------------* Changed ``manhole-cli``:  * Won't spam the terminal with errors if socket file doesn't exist.  * Allowed sending any signal (new ``--signal`` argument).  * Fixed some validation issues for the ``PID`` argument.1.1.0 (2015-06-06)------------------* Added support for installing the manhole via the ``PYTHONMANHOLE`` environment variable.* Added a ``strict`` install option. Set it to false to avoid getting the ``AlreadyInstalled`` exception.* Added a ``manhole-cli`` script that emulates ``socat readline unix-connect:/tmp/manhole-1234``.1.0.0 (2014-10-13)------------------* Added ``socket_path`` install option (contributed by `Nir Soffer`_).* Added ``reinstall_delay`` install option.* Added ``locals`` install option (contributed by `Nir Soffer`_).* Added ``redirect_stderr`` install option (contributed by `Nir Soffer`_).* Lots of internals cleanup (contributed by `Nir Soffer`_).0.6.2 (2014-04-28)------------------* Fix OS X regression.0.6.1 (2014-04-28)------------------* Support for OS X (contributed by `Saulius Menkevičius`_)... _Saulius Menkevičius: https://github.com/razzmatazz.. _Nir Soffer: https://github.com/nirs</longdescription>

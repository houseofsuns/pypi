	<longdescription># e621-dl**e621-dl** is a simple and fast e621 post/pool downloader. It is based upon the [e621](https://github.com/Hmiku8338/e621-py-stable) api wrapper both in implementation and interface.## Installation`pip install e621-dl`## Quickstart### Downloading Posts* To download posts with the ids 12345 and 67891:`e6 posts get 12345 67891`* To download all posts that match the canine but not the 3d tag:`e6 posts search &quot;canine -3d&quot;`* To download 500 posts that match the 3d tag:`e6 posts search 3d -m 500`* To download posts that match the 3d tag to directory e621_downloads:`e6 posts search 3d -d e621_downloads`* To download all posts that match the 3d tag and replace all post duplicates from the parent directory with symlinks:`e6 posts search 3d -s`### Downloading Pools* To download the pools with the ids 12345 and 67891:`e6 pools get 12345 67891`* To download at most 10 pools whose names start with &quot;Hello&quot; and end with &quot;Kitty&quot; with anything else in the middle.`e6 pools search --name-matches Hello*Kitty -m 10`* To download the top 3 active series ordered by post count to a directory named &quot;my_top_3&quot;:`e6 pools search --is-active --order post_count -m 3 -d my_top_3`* There are a lot more options so I recommend checking out the output of `e6 pools search --help`### Using Api Key* To save e621 login information to be used for every future query:`e6 login`* To remove e621 login information:`e6 logout`### Optimizing Space* To replace all post duplicates from the current directory (all of its subdirectories) with symlinks:`e6 clean`## FAQ and Known Issues* If your tags include the minus (-) sign, a colon (:), or any other character bash/typer might consider special -- you must wrap your query in quotation marks. For example,`e6 posts search &quot;3d -canine order:score&quot;`* For advanced reference, use `--help` option. For example, `e6 --help`, `e6 posts search --help`, etc.</longdescription>

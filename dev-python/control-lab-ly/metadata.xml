Check the documentation for more details on each class and function.---## Advanced UsageFor more advanced uses, Control.lab.ly provides a host of tools to streamline the development of lab equipment automation. This includes setting up configuration files and adding plugin drivers.### Import package```pythonimport controllably as lab```Optionally, you can set the safety policy for the session. This feature allows the user to prevent collisions before each movement is made. The safety policy has to be assigned before importing any of the `Mover` objects.```pythonlab.set_safety('high')  # Notifies; Pauses for input before every move actionlab.set_safety('low')   # Notifies; Waits for countdown before every move actionlab.set_safety(None)    # Carries out movement actions without delay# Import control-lab-ly classes only after setting the safety policy```### Contents1.

Creating a new setupCreate a `/configs/MySetup` folder that holds the configuration files for the setup, which includes `config.yaml` and `layout.json`.```pythonlab.create_setup(setup_name = &quot;MySetup&quot;)```#### 1.1 `config.yaml`This file stores the configuration and calibration values for your devices.```yamlMyDevice:                                       # device name  module: Move                                  # top-level category  class: Cartesian.Ender                        # device class  settings:    port: COM1                                  # serial port address    setting_A: {'tuple': [300,0,200]}           # use keys to define the type of iterable    setting_B: {'array': [[0,1,0],[-1,0,0]]}    # only tuple and np.array supported```&gt; Each device configuration starts with the device name, then the following parameters:\&gt; `module`: top-level category (such as Make, Measure, Move,Transfer, View)\&gt; `class`: point to specific subclass using dot notation\&gt; `settings`: various initialisation settings\&gt; *See the* [**guide**](#view-documentation) *for more details on these parameters*Compound devices are similarly configured. ```yamlMyCompoundDevice:                         # compound device name  module: Compound  class: LiquidMover.LiquidMoverSetup  settings:                               # settings for your compound device    setting_C: True    component_config:                     # nest component configuration settings here      MyFirstDevice:                      # component device name        module: Transfer        class: Liquid.SyringeAssembly        settings:                         # settings for your component device          port: COM22          setting_D: 2                          MySecondDevice:                     # component device name        module: Mover        class: Jointed.Dobot.M1Pro        settings:                         # settings for your compound device          ip_address: '192.0.0.1'```&gt; The configuration values for the component devices are nested under the `component_config` setting of the compound device.Lastly, you can define shortcuts (or nicknames) to quickly access the components of compound devices.```yamlSHORTCUTS:  First: 'MyCompoundDevice.MyFirstDevice'  Second: 'MyCompoundDevice.MySecondDevice'```&gt; A different serial port address or camera index may be used by different machines for the same device.\*See* [**Section 3**](#3-creating-a-new-project) *to find out how to manage the different addresses used by different machines.*#### 1.2 `layout.json`This file stores the layout configuration of your physical workspace, also known as a `Deck`.\*See* [**Section 2**](#2-managing-a-deck) *on how to load this information into the setup.**Optional: if your setup does not involve moving objects around in a pre-defined workspace,  a layout configuration may not be required*&gt; This package uses the same Labware files as those provided by [Opentrons](https://opentrons.com/), which can be found [here](https://labware.opentrons.com/), and custom Labware files can be created [here](https://labware.opentrons.com/create/). Labware files are JSON files that specifies the external and internal dimensions of a Labware block / object.```json{  &quot;reference_points&quot;:{    &quot;1&quot;: [11.1,22.2,33.3],    &quot;2&quot;: [44.4,55.5,66.6],    &quot;3&quot;: [77.7,88.8,99.9]  },  &quot;slots&quot;:{    &quot;1&quot;: {      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;MyLabware01&quot;,      &quot;exclusion_height&quot;: -1,      &quot;filepath&quot;: &quot;MyREPO/.../MyLabware01.json&quot;    },    &quot;2&quot;: {      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;MyLabware02&quot;,      &quot;exclusion_height&quot;: 0,      &quot;filepath&quot;: &quot;MyREPO/.../MyLabware02.json&quot;    },    &quot;3&quot;: {      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;MyLabware03&quot;,      &quot;exclusion_height&quot;: 10,      &quot;filepath&quot;: &quot;MyREPO/.../MyLabware03.json&quot;    }  }}```&gt; In `reference_points`, the bottom-left coordinates of each slot on the deck are defined. Slots are positions where Labware blocks may be placed.&gt; In `slots`, the `name` of the Labware and the `filepath` to the JSON file containing Labware details are defined. The filepath starts with the name of the repository's base folder.\&gt;\&gt; The `exclusion_height` is the height (in mm) above the dimensions of the Labware block to steer clear from when performing movement actions. Values less than 0 means the Labware is not avoided.\&gt;\&gt; *(Note: Labware avoidance only applies to final coordinates (i.e. destination). Does not guarantee collision avoidance when using point-to-point move actions. Use* `safeMoveTo()` *instead.)*#### 1.3 Load setupThe initialisation of the setup occurs when importing `setup` from `configs.MySetup`. With `setup`, you can access all the devices that you have defined in [**Section 1.1**](#11-configyaml).```python### main.py #### Add repository folder to sys.pathfrom pathlib import Pathimport sysREPO = 'MyREPO'ROOT = str(Path().absolute()).split(REPO)[0]sys.path.append(f'{ROOT}{REPO}')# Import the initialised setupfrom configs.MySetup import setupsetup.MyDevicesetup.First```### 2. Managing a deck*Optional: if your setup does not involve moving items around in a pre-defined workspace,  a* `Deck` *may not be required*#### 2.1 Loading a deckTo load a `Deck` from the layout file, use the `loadDeck()` function of a `Mover` object (or its subclasses).```pythonfrom configs.MySetup import setup, LAYOUT_FILEsetup.Mover.loadDeck(LAYOUT_FILE)``` &gt; `LAYOUT_FILE` contains the details that has been defined in `layout.json` (see [**Section 1.2**](#12-layoutjson))#### 2.2 Loading a LabwareTo load a `Labware` onto the deck, use the `loadLabware()` method of the `Deck` object.```pythonsetup.Mover.deck.loadLabware(...)``` &gt; This package uses the same Labware files as those provided by [Opentrons](https://opentrons.com/), which can be found [here](https://labware.opentrons.com/), and custom Labware files can be created [here](https://labware.opentrons.com/create/). Labware files are JSON files that specifies the external and internal dimensions of a Labware block / object.### 3. Managing project addressesA `/configs` folder will have been created in the base folder of your project repository to store all configuration related files from which the package will read from, in [**Section 1**](#1-creating-a-new-setup). A template of `registry.yaml` has also been added to the `/configs` folder to manage the machine-specific addresses of your connected devices (e.g. serial port and camera index).```yaml### registry.yaml ###'012345678901234':              # insert your machine's 15-digit ID here    cam_index:                  # camera index of the connected imaging devices      __cam_01__: 1             # keep the leading and trailing double underscores      __cam_02__: 0    port:                       # addresses of serial ports      __MyDevice__: COM1        # keep the leading and trailing double underscores      __MyFirstDevice__: COM22```&gt; Use the `Helper.get_node()` function to get the 15-digit unique identifier of your machine\&gt; Use the `Helper.get_port()` function to get the serial port addresses of your connect devices```pythonlab.Helper.get_node()           # Get your machine's ID (15-digit)lab.Helper.get_ports()          # Get the port addresses of connected devices```Afterwards, change the value for the serial port address in the `config.yaml` file to match the registry.```yaml### config.yaml ###MyDevice:  module: Move  class: Cartesian.Ender  settings:    port: __MyDevice__          # serial port address```### 4. Using plugins*Optional: if drivers for your hardware components are already included, plugins may not be required*User-defined plugins can be easily written and integrated into Control.lab.ly. All available classes and functions can be found in `lab.modules`.```pythonlab.guide_me()                              # Use guide to view imported objectslab.modules.at.Make.Something.Good.MyClass  # Access the class ```#### 4.1 Registering a Class or FunctionYou can import the class and register the object using the `Factory.register()` function.```pythonfrom my_module import MyClasslab.Factory.register(MyClass, &quot;Make.Something.Good&quot;)```#### 4.2 Registering a Python moduleAlternatively, you can automatically register all Classes and Functions in a Python module just by importing it.&gt; 1. Declare a `__where__` global variable to indicate where to register the module&gt; 2. At the end of the .py file, import and call  the `include_this_module()` function```python### my_module.py ###__where__ = &quot;Make.Something.Good&quot;               # Where to register this module todef MyClass:                                    # Main body of code goes here  ...def my_function:  ...from controllably import include_this_module    # Registers only the Classes and Functionsinclude_this_module()                           # defined above in this .py file```The Classes and Functions in the module will be registered when you import the module.```python### main.py ###from my_module import MyClass, my_function```---## Dependencies- Markdown (&gt;=3.3.4)- numpy (&gt;=1.19.5)- opencv-python (&gt;=4.5.4.58)- pandas (&gt;=1.2.4)- pyModbusTCP (&gt;=0.2.0)- pyserial (&gt;=3.5)- PySimpleGUI (&gt;=4.60.5)- PyVISA (&gt;=1.12.0)- PyYAML (&gt;=6.0)- tkhtmlview (&gt;=0.2.0)## Contributors[@kylejeanlewis](https://github.com/kylejeanlewis)\[@mat-fox](https://github.com/mat-fox)\[@Quijanove](https://github.com/Quijanove)\[@AniketChitre](https://github.com/AniketChitre)## How to Contribute[Issues](https://github.com/kylejeanlewis/control-lab-le/issues) and feature requests are welcome!## LicenseThis project is distributed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/kylejeanlewis/control-lab-le/blob/main/LICENSE).---# Change Log## Unreleased*Items under development*- Integration for mass balance from Sartorius## Version 1.2.0Feature enhancements, bug fixes and patches.

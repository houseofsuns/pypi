It includes a variety of metrics to capture different aspects of the data, for example **quality and privacy**. It also includes reports that you can run to generate insights, visualize data and share with your team.The SDMetrics library is **model-agnostic**, meaning you can use any synthetic data. The library does not need to know how you created the data. &lt;img align=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;docs/images/column_comparison.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;# InstallInstall SDMetrics using pip or conda. We recommend using a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other software on your device.```bashpip install sdmetrics``````bashconda install -c conda-forge sdmetrics```For more information about using SDMetrics, visit the [SDMetrics Documentation](https://docs.sdv.dev/sdmetrics).# UsageGet started with **SDMetrics Reports** using some demo data,```pythonfrom sdmetrics import load_demofrom sdmetrics.reports.single_table import QualityReportreal_data, synthetic_data, metadata = load_demo(modality='single_table')my_report = QualityReport()my_report.generate(real_data, synthetic_data, metadata)``````Creating report: 100%|██████████| 4/4 [00:00&lt;00:00,  5.22it/s]Overall Quality Score: 82.84%Properties:Column Shapes: 82.78%Column Pair Trends: 82.9%```Once you generate the report, you can drill down on the details and visualize the results.```pythonmy_report.get_visualization(property_name='Column Pair Trends')```&lt;img align=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;docs/images/column_pairs.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;Save the report and share it with your team.```pythonmy_report.save(filepath='demo_data_quality_report.pkl')# load it at any point in the futuremy_report = QualityReport.load(filepath='demo_data_quality_report.pkl')```**Want more metrics?** You can also manually apply any of the metrics in this library to your data.```python# calculate whether the synthetic data respects the min/max bounds# set by the real datafrom sdmetrics.single_column import BoundaryAdherenceBoundaryAdherence.compute(    real_data['start_date'],    synthetic_data['start_date'])``````0.8503937007874016``````python# calculate whether the synthetic data is new or whether it's an exact copy of the real datafrom sdmetrics.single_table import NewRowSynthesisNewRowSynthesis.compute(    real_data,    synthetic_data,    metadata)``````1.0```# What's next?To learn more about the reports and metrics, visit the [SDMetrics Documentation](https://docs.sdv.dev/sdmetrics). ---&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://datacebo.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;center&quot; width=40% src=&quot;https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/blob/master/docs/images/DataCebo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[The Synthetic Data Vault Project](https://sdv.dev) was first created at MIT's [Data to AI Lab](https://dai.lids.mit.edu/) in 2016. After 4 years of research and traction with enterprise, wecreated [DataCebo](https://datacebo.com) in 2020 with the goal of growing the project.Today, DataCebo is the proud developer of SDV, the largest ecosystem forsynthetic data generation &amp; evaluation. It is home to multiple libraries that support syntheticdata, including:* 🔄 Data discovery &amp; transformation. Reverse the transforms to reproduce realistic data.* 🧠 Multiple machine learning models -- ranging from Copulas to Deep Learning -- to create tabular,  multi table and time series data.* 📊 Measuring quality and privacy of synthetic data, and comparing different synthetic data  generation models.[Get started using the SDV package](https://sdv.dev/SDV/getting_started/install.html) -- a fullyintegrated solution and your one-stop shop for synthetic data. Or, use the standalone librariesfor specific needs.# History## v0.11.1 - 2023-09-14This release makes multiple changes to better handle errors that get raised from the `DiagnosticReport`. The report should be able to run to completion now and have any errors that it encounters reported in a column on the details that can be observed from running `get_details`. It also resolves many warnings that were interrupting the printing of the report's results and progress.### New Features* Create single table coverage property - Issue [#389](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDMetrics/issues/389) by @R-Palazzo* Create single table synthesis property - Issue [#390](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDMetrics/issues/390) by @R-Palazzo* Create single table Boundaries property - Issue [#391](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDMetrics/issues/391) by @R-Palazzo* Add multi table Coverage, Synthesis and Boundaries property - Issue [#393](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDMetrics/issues/393) by @R-Palazzo### Bugs Fixed* Ensure that the `Synthesis` property score doesn't change - Issue [#425](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDMetrics/issues/425) by @amontanez24* The Error column contains a mix of `NaN` and `None` values - Issue [#427](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDMetrics/issues/427) by @pvk-developer* Always show the `Table` column in `get_details` - Issue [#429](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDMetrics/issues/429) by @frances-h* Diagnostic explanations should not repeat if I generate multiple times - Issue [#430](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDMetrics/issues/430) by @amontanez24* RangeCoverage errors on datetime columns in DiagnosticReport - Issue [#431](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDMetrics/issues/431) by @frances-h* The coverage visualization shows empty bar graph for nan values - Issue [#432](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDMetrics/issues/432) by @frances-h* Diagnostic report should skip over all NaN columns - Issue [#433](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDMetrics/issues/433) by @pvk-developer* Quality report is printing out a long warning message (hundreds of lines) - Issue [#448](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDMetrics/issues/448) by @amontanez24### Internal* Use property classes in single table DiagnosticReport - Issue [#392](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDMetrics/issues/392) by @R-Palazzo* Use property classes in multi table DiagnosticReport - Issue [#394](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDMetrics/issues/394) by @R-Palazzo## v0.11.0 - 2023-08-10This release adds a function that allows users to plot the cardinality of foreign and primary keys in synthetic data.

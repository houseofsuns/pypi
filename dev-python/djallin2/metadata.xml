	<longdescription># DJALLIN2A mildly configurable twitch noisemaker capable of responding to chat and point redemptions.Available through pip (`djallin2`) or as a [standalone executable](https://github.com/vilhelmen/djallin2/releases) for macOS and Windows.Note for Windows users, your antivirus will probably think it's a trojan.It's not, but it kinda looks like one to your antivirus.If you get the option to report a false positive, please do so.## QuickstartWant `!sound` to just work?* Download the latest build from the [releases tab](https://github.com/vilhelmen/djallin2/releases)* Download the [quick config file](./quick_config.txt), rename it to `config.txt`* Place your sounds in a folder called sounds, next to the app and config* Run it, your browser will open to handle the initial Twitch connection    * This will happen every ~3 months as necessary## Configuration`config.txt` holds your token and configures chat and point responders.Take a look at the [example configuration](./example_config.txt) for examples, and a detailed explanation for all settings.The following block defines a basic chat listener:```toml[chat.sound]    badges = ['moderator', 'broadcaster', 'vip']    target = './sounds/'    command = '!sound '```Mods, VIPs, and the broadcaster can use `!sound xxx` to play `./sounds/xxx.mp3`If badge and name filters are not supplied, anyone can use the command.The `random` setting enables random playback.A value of `2` selects a random file from the directory.```toml[chat.wisdom]    target = './wisdom/'    command = '!wisdom'    random = 2```Points rewards are similarly configured.Set the `name` to the name configured in your twitch rewards.A `random` value of `1` enables the `random` command where a random file will be selected if a user enters `random`.```toml[points.sound]    name = 'play a sound'    target = './sounds/'    random = 1```Alternatively, you can duplicate configurations using links.Setting applied in the block with a `link` statement override settings in the linked responder. ```toml[points.sound]    link = 'chat.sound'    random = 1````command_mode` can be used to define different match modes for the `command`.`contains` allows you to play a single file or randomly select from a directory when a message contains the command phrase.Chat listeners are checked in alphabetical order and when one plays a sound, checks stop.```toml[chat.z_cowboy]    command = 'cowboy'    command_mode = 'contains'    target = './sound/yeehaw.mp3'```Both point and chat blocks support custom code actions, check the [example configuration](./example_config.txt) for details.Playback statistics can be recorded to a sqlite3 database of your choice.Simply add `stats = true` to your configuration block.```toml[chat.sound]    target = './sounds/'    command = '!sound '    stats = true```The name of the database can be changed by setting `stats_db = 'database.sqlite'` at the top of your configuration file.# Known issuesIf a red screen shows when registering your twitch token, there may be a problem with your connection.Close the soundbot and try again.# TODO:1. This1. Let exit on fire be a configurable option?1. HTTP command receiver (lioran?)1. custom hook code - lioran example? obs websocket?1. Bits?1.

This includes original Belvis portfolios, as well as synthetic ones that are the sum of several original porfolios. It also specifies where relevant prices can be found in Belvis.* The ``Api`` class is used to query the belvis Api and retrieve data, including the authentication part.----------Repository----------The git repository is hosted on github:http://www.github.com/rwijtvliet/belvys----------Developing----------This project uses ``black`` to format code and ``flake8`` for linting.

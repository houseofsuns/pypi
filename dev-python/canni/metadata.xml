	<longdescription>Canni=====If you are looking for the generated html code example (Triple Trouble):https://networkjanitor.gitlab.io/canni/If you are looking for the real, up-to-date versions, please use the following links:* Triple Trouble: https://networkjanitor.gitlab.io/xutt/* The Shatterer: https://networkjanitor.gitlab.io/jinni/Technical Design Goals/Criteria-------------------------------* lightweight* single page* avoid javascript as often as possible (tabs with css, copy requires javascript :[ )* offline portability (can save the file and open it from harddrive - still works)* easy to use* dataset source type as `xutt &lt;https://gitlab.com/networkjanitor/xutt&gt;`_ (same as the linux terminal version of Canni: `bronk &lt;https://gitlab.com/networkjanitor/bronk&gt;`_)Info about changes to the dataset---------------------------------Sometimes when I feel like it, I'll update the used dataset here from the `xutt &lt;https://gitlab.com/networkjanitor/xutt&gt;`_ repo to generate a more up-to-date example.If you have any specific change requests (regarding the dataset used for the example), please feel free to create issues (or preferably pull requests) in the `xutt &lt;https://gitlab.com/networkjanitor/xutt&gt;`_ repo.TODOs-----* write a demo dataset instead of using xutt to demonstrate things without the triple trouble/guildwars2 terminology</longdescription>

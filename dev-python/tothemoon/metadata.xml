	<longdescription># tothemoon evx ML modelThis is a simplified version of [evxpredictor](https://pypi.org/project/evxpredictor/) package used to generate buy and sell signals for crypto and conventional stock markets based on the excess volume indicator(EVX). EVX is a concept where the bid-ask spread is estimated inherently from current market prices. You can read more about Evx in the free whitepaper [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345313655_DeFiPaper)  # InstallationInstall tothemoon with `python3 -m pip install tothemoon`  # UsageIn your python script simply import the module and use as follows:```  from tothemoon.moon import signalprint(signal(20,65,utcdatetime))```The above methods take an assets open, close prices of the asset based on the time interval you have chosen in OHCLV type. A zero classification output would instruct the user to sell, while one output means don't sell or buy if the asset is not already present in the orders.  # Testing an entire dataframeTesting of a dataframe for correct buy, sell signals is as simple as applying the function as follows:  ```import pandas as pdfrom moon import signal, Regbotdf = pd.read_csv('path/toyour/file.csv')def getSignal(open,close,utcdatetime):    return signal(open,close,utcdatetime)# select long profitable tradesdf2 = df[df['close_profit_abs'] &gt; 0]df2 = df2[df2['is_short'] == 0]print(df2.head())# Run all predictionsdf2['enter_long_pred'] = df.apply(lambda row: getSignal(row['open'], row['close'], row['date']), axis=1)print(len(df2[df2['enter_long_pred'] == df2['is_short']]), len(df) )print(df2[df2['is_short']==0].head(15))```Your original data must already have some presumed 'buy' signal.# WarningThis is not financial advise. tothemoon is entirely on its preliminary stages. Use it at your own risk.</longdescription>

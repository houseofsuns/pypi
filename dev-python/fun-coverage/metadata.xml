	<longdescription># fun-coveragefun-coverage is a tool to extract *function coverage* from the *statement (= line) coverage* of [coverage.py](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy).## InstallationThe simplest way to install fun-coverage is with pip:```shellpip install fun-coverage```## Getting startedAfter installing the package, a `fun-coverage` command will be available.You need to run coverage.py first. For example, if you're using it through [pytest-cov](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/):```shellpytest --cov=&lt;my_module&gt; &lt;my_module_tests&gt;```Once this is done, simply run:```shellfun-coverage```This will print a text report similar to the one of coverage.py, but for functions. The report will include the line numbers of the missed functions.For example, this is the output of `fun-coverage` run on its example test suite (as a preliminary step of its actual test suite):```Name                                                                            Funcs   Miss   Cover   Missing--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------tests/example_test_suite/src/__init__.py                                            0      0    100%tests/example_test_suite/src/async_function.py                                      1      0    100%tests/example_test_suite/src/covered_function_with_partially_covered_lines.py       1      0    100%tests/example_test_suite/src/docstring_only_function.py                             1      0    100%tests/example_test_suite/src/excluded_function.py                                   0      0    100%tests/example_test_suite/src/methods.py                                             2      2      0%   6, 9tests/example_test_suite/src/non_covered_function.py                                1      1      0%   1--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TOTAL                                                                               6      3     50%```## How it worksfun-coverage looks for functions and methods in the source code files concerned by a previous round of statement coverage measurement, then marks them as hit if and only if their first statement has been hit.Specifically, this starts from the `.coverage` file left by coverage.py. This is configurable with the `--cov-file` flag.## Command-line options```usage: fun-coverage [--cov-file COV_FILE] [--cov-fail-under MIN]  --cov-file COV_FILE   Which coverage file to analyze (default .coverage in the current directory)  --cov-fail-under MIN  Fail if the total coverage is strictly less than MIN (a percentage between 0 and 100)```## Excluding code from fun-coverageIf the line containing the `def` or `async def` statement for a function is [excluded](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/excluding.html) from coverage.py, then fun-coverage ignores that entire function.## Compatibilityfun-coverage has been tested with `coverage==6.4`, and `pytest-cov==3.0.0`.## DevelopmentThis section only applies if you wish to contribute to the project.### pre-commitThis project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/). Please [install it](https://pre-commit.com/#install), then activate it to run automatically on `git commit`:```shellpre-commit install```### TestsRun the test suite with:```shellmake test```</longdescription>

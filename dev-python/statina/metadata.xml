To run in a production setting please refer to documentationfor suggestions how.**Once installed, you can set up Statina by running a few commands using the included command line interface. Given you have a MongoDB server listening on the default port (27017), this is how you would set up a fully working Statina demo:```bashstatina load batch --result-file statina/tests/fixtures/valid_fluffy.csv```Settings can be used by exporting the environment variables: `DB_NAME`, `DB_URI`, `HOST`, `PORT`This will set up an instance of Statina with a database called `statina-demo`. Now run```bashstatina serve --reload``` and play around with the interface.### Docker imageStatina can also run as a container. The image is available [on Docker Hub][docker-hub] or can be build using the Dockerfile provided in this repository.To build a new image from the Dockerfile use the commands: `docker build -t statina .`To run the image use the following command: `docker run --name statina statina statina `To remove the container, type: `docker rm statina`## Release modelStatina is using github flow release model as described in our development manual.### Steps to make a new release:1) Get you PR approved.2) Append the version bump to PR title. Eg. __Update README__ becomes __Update Readme (patch)__3) Select __squash and merge__4) Write a change log comment.5) Merge.### Deploying to stagingOpening pull requests in Statina repository will enable a Github Action to build containers and publish to [statina-stage dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/clinicalgenomics/statina-stage) with each commit.Two tags will be published: one with the name of the branch and another tagged &quot;latest&quot;.Steps to test current branch on staging:`ssh firstname.lastname@cg-vm1.scilifelab.se``sudo -iu hiseq.clinical``ssh localhost`If you made changes to internal app : `systemctl --user restart statina.target` Your branch should be deployed to staging at https://statina-stage.scilifelab.se If for some reason you cannot access the application at given address, check status of the container: `systemctl --user status statinaApp.service`### Deploying to productionUse `update-statina.sh` script to update production both on Hasta and CGVS. **Please follow the development guide and `servers` repo when doing so. It is also important to keep those involved informed.**## Back EndThe Statina database is a Mongo database consisting of following collections:- **batch** - holds batch level information.- **sample** - holds sample level information.- **user** - holds user names, emails and roles.The database is loaded through the CLI with data generated by the [FluFFyPipe][Fluffy][Fluffy]: https://github.com/Clinical-Genomics/fluffy[WisecondorX]: https://github.com/CenterForMedicalGeneticsGhent/WisecondorX[docker-hub]: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/clinicalgenomics/statina</longdescription>

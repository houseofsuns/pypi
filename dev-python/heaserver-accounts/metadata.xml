	<longdescription># HEA Server AWS Accounts Microservice[Research Informatics Shared Resource](https://risr.hci.utah.edu), [Huntsman Cancer Institute](https://hci.utah.edu),Salt Lake City, UTThe HEA Server AWS Accounts Microservice is It manages the AWS account information details.## Version 1Initial release.## Runtime requirements* Python 3.10.## Development environment### Build requirements* Any development environment is fine.* On Windows, you also will need:    * Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019, found at https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/. Select the C++ tools.    * git, found at https://git-scm.com/download/win.* On Mac, Xcode or the command line developer tools is required, found in the Apple Store app.* Python 3.10: Download and install Python 3.10 from https://www.python.org, and select the options to install for all users and addPython to your environment variables. The install for all users option will help keep you from accidentally installingpackages into your Python installation's site-packages directory instead of to your virtualenv environment, describedbelow.* Create a virtualenv environment using the `python -m venv &lt;venv_directory&gt;` command, substituting `&lt;venv_directory&gt;`with the directory name of your virtual environment. Run `source &lt;venv_directory&gt;/bin/activate` (or `&lt;venv_directory&gt;/Scripts/activate` on Windows) to activate the virtualenvironment. You will need to activate the virtualenv every time before starting work, or your IDE may be able to dothis for you automatically. **Note that PyCharm will do this for you, but you have to create a new Terminal panelafter you newly configure a project with your virtualenv.*** From the project's root directory, and using the activated virtualenv, run `pip install wheel` followed by  `pip install -r requirements_dev.txt`. **Do NOT run `python setup.py develop`. It will break your environment.**### Running testsRun tests with the `pytest` command from the project root directory. To improve performance, run tests in multipleprocesses with `pytest -n auto`.### Testing using SwaggerRun `python ./run-swaggerui.py` and open up http://locahost:8080/docs in your web browser to get a UI for making RESTAPI calls.### VersioningUse semantic versioning as described inhttps://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#choosing-a-versioning-scheme. In addition,while development is underway, the version should be the next version number suffixed by `.dev`.### Version tags in gitVersion tags should follow the format `heaserver-awsaccounts-&lt;version&gt;`, for example, `heaserver-awsaccounts-1.0.0`.### Uploading to an index serverThe following instructions assume separate stable and staging indexes. Numbered releases, including alphas and betas, gointo the stable index. Snapshots of works in progress go into the staging index. Thus, use staging to upload numberedreleases, verify the uploaded packages, and then upload to stable.From the project's root directory:1. For numbered releases, remove `.dev` from the version number in setup.py, tag it in git to indicate a release,and commit to version control. Skip this step for developer snapshot releases.2. Run `python setup.py clean --all sdist bdist_wheel` to create the artifacts.3. Run `twine upload -r &lt;repository&gt; dist/&lt;wheel-filename&gt; dist/&lt;tarball-filename&gt;` to upload to the repository. The repository name has to be defined in a twine configuration file such as `$HOME/.pypirc`.4. For numbered releases, increment the version number in setup.py, append `.dev` to it, and commit to versioncontrol with a commit message like, &quot;Prepare for next development iteration.&quot;</longdescription>

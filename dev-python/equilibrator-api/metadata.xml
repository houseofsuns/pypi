It can take more than an hour (depending on the connection speed).Note that the initialization might not work inside a Jupyter notebook environment - in that case you should try running it in a standard python shell first and thenrun the Jupyter notebook.```pythonfrom equilibrator_api import ComponentContributioncc = ComponentContribution()rxn = cc.parse_reaction_formula(&quot;kegg:C00002 + kegg:C00001 = kegg:C00008 + kegg:C00009&quot;)print(f&quot;ΔG'0 = {cc.standard_dg_prime(rxn)}&quot;)```</longdescription>

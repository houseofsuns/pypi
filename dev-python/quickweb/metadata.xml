	<longdescription># QuickWebQuickWeb is a Python Web Application Server based on the production-proved [CherryPy](https://cherrypy.org/) Web Framework extended with developer friendly features.## Features### Development- Custom static content folders (any folder containing a `.static` file)- Automatic path based routing for templates and controllers, e.g.:  - /about.html is available as /about  - /submit.py is available as /submit- Zero code Jinja2 template rendering for .html files, that can:  - Use data from YAML files (name.html &lt; name.yaml)  - Use HTTP specific data e.g. `{{session}}`- Zero code Markdown files rendering- Low code Python controllers- Integrated HTTP functional Testing- Reload on code changes## Production- [SSL](doc/SSL.md) support- [Mutual TLS](doc/MUTUAL_TLS.md) support## InstallingQuickWeb requires Python3.6+ and can run on Windows, Linux or Mac.Install quickweb using pip:```shpip install quickweb```If the installation is succesful the `quickweb` command will be available, it will allow you to manage quickweb applications from the command line.## Getting Started### Creating your first applicationCreate your first quickweb app using a bootstrap based template:```shquickweb create my-web-app bootstrap-navbar-fixed-top```You will get a _my-web-app_ directory containing a quickweb sample app using the [Bootstrap]((https://www.google.com)) library.### Changing the application contentCheck the application directory using your preferred HTML/CSS/JavaScript editor/IDE, edit the the content from the `webroot` directory as needed.### Starting the applicationAfter making some changes and you can test the application executing:```shquickweb run my-web-app```A web server is started using port 8080 on your local system. You can check your application by browsing to http://localhost:8080. If you later change some of the YAML/HTML/CSS/JS, you can check the changes by refreshing the corresponding page on your browser.### Deploying to a cloud platformWhen your application is ready for public access you can deploy it to a cloud platform, it has been tested with the following providers:- Heroku Cloud Application Platform (deploy with: git push heroku master)- IBM Bluemix (deploy with: cf push appname)- Other CloudFoundry based provider (deploy with: cf push appname)It should be able to run from other [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org) based providers.NOTES: * Check the cloud provider documentation for the web app detailed setup instructions   - Use the instructions for python web applications setup/deployment * The level of support for python based apps will depend on your provider, check it's documentation for details## ContributingCheck the [Contributing Guide](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).Maintained By-------------* João Pinto for the [Open Pipe](//github.com/OpenPipe) initiative</longdescription>

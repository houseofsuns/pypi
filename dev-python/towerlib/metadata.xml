	<longdescription>========towerlib========A python library to interface with ansible tower's (awx) api.* Documentation: https://towerlib.readthedocs.org/en/latestDevelopment Workflow====================The workflow supports the following steps * lint * test * build * document * upload * graphThese actions are supported out of the box by the corresponding scripts under _CI/scripts directory with sane defaults based on best practices.Sourcing setup_aliases.ps1 for windows powershell or setup_aliases.sh in bash on Mac or Linux will provide with handy aliases for the shell of all those commands prepended with an underscore.The bootstrap script creates a .venv directory inside the project directory hosting the virtual environment. It uses pipenv for that.It is called by all other scripts before they do anything. So one could simple start by calling _lint and that would set up everything before it tried to actually lint the projectOnce the code is ready to be delivered the _tag script should be called accepting one of three arguments, patch, minor, major following the semantic versioning scheme.So for the initial delivery one would call    $ _tag --minorwhich would bump the version of the project to 0.1.0 tag it in git and do a push and also ask for the change and automagically update HISTORY.rst with the version and the change provided.So the full workflow after git is initialized is: * repeat as necessary (of course it could be test - code - lint :) )   * code   * lint   * test * commit and push * develop more through the code-lint-test cycle * tag (with the appropriate argument) * build * upload (if you want to host your package in pypi) * document (of course this could be run at any point)Important Information=====================This template is based on pipenv. In order to be compatible with requirements.txt so the actual created package can be used by any part of the existing python ecosystem some hacks were needed.So when building a package out of this **do not** simple call    $ python setup.py sdist bdist_egg**as this will produce an unusable artifact with files missing.**Instead use the provided build and upload scripts that create all the necessary files in the artifact.Project Features================* Can get, create and delete all entities in a tower deployment.Todo----This code is MVP and needs a lot of improvements.Some of them are, optimize all queries, implement searching and filtering and implement smart caching of entities.History-------0.1.0 (25-05-2018)------------------* First release0.2.0 (27-07-2018)------------------* Refactored code to use entity managers for all tower objects saving a huge amount of network calls and implemented  filtering* Removed pipenv locking mechanism as this is broken for python 2.7 completely0.3.0 (01-08-2018)------------------* Added capability to launch job template job1.0.0 (27-09-2018)------------------* Added support for specifying http or https and certificate verifications options* Extented the editing capabilities of hosts to name, description and enabled status2.0.0 (16-10-2018)------------------* Implemented dynamic attributes in running jobs.* Implemented cancel capabilities for running jobs.* Updated the template to python 3.7* Officially dropped support for python 2.72.0.1 (25-10-2018)------------------* Update template and dependencies2.0.2 (25-10-2018)------------------* Reverted breaking change for upload script2.0.3 (29-11-2018)------------------* Fixed reference in the package for the right github repo2.1.0 (29-11-2018)------------------* Fixed issue https://github.com/schubergphilis/towerlib/issues/11 with some organization entities2.2.0 (03-12-2018)------------------* Implemented group association retrieval (contribution by &lt;aopgenoort@schubergphilis.com&gt;)2.3.0 (05-12-2018)------------------* Added group association and disassociation2.3.1 (03-01-2019)------------------* Bumped Requests2.3.2 (09-01-2019)------------------* Changed library.py 2.3.3 (07-03-2019)------------------* update setup.py 2.3.4 (04-04-2019)------------------* Added missing import of object that caused a bug in the EntityManager crashing, not being able to load it.2.3.5 (25-07-2019)------------------* fix for https://github.com/schubergphilis/towerlib/pull/222.3.6 (31-07-2019)------------------* Fixed inventory host deletion.3.0.0 (18-10-2019)------------------* Fixed the references to all the objects to be identified by their parent relationship to avoid ambiguity.

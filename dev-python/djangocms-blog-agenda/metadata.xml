	<longdescription>Add an Agenda to your blog that displays upcoming events!*Easy! ~~Cheap~~Free! Not seen on TV!*----## Install* Install the package    ```bash    python3 -m pip install djangocms-blog-agenda    ```* Add it in your `INSTALLED_APPS`:    ```python        &quot;djangocms_blog_agenda&quot;,    ```* Run the migration:    ```sh    python3 manage.py migrate djangocms_blog_agenda    ```* Update the `djangocms-blog` urls by the ones in this module, by using this lovely [setting](https://djangocms-blog.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/urlconf.html):    ```py    BLOG_URLCONF = &quot;djangocms_blog_agenda.patched_urls&quot;    ```* Create a new blog configuration.  * Instance namespace: *put what you want*.  * Application title: *put what you want*.  * Object name: *put what you want*.  * [...]  * &lt;b&gt;Click on &lt;kbd&gt;Layout (Show)&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/b&gt;:    * [...]    * **Template prefix**: `djangocms_blog_agenda`.    &gt; That's ***very*** important since this application will check this value multiple times (to update the queryset, to check the templates, to add the post extension &quot;event date&quot; only to the Agenda app...).  * Save this config.* ![that's all folks!](https://gitlab.com/kapt/open-source/djangocms-blog-agenda/uploads/2a4d7f27d4eaf5e3b07ed4779dde76d2/image.png)----## Explanations/Views/Misc* A new `Event date` DateTime field has been added to blog posts that have the template prefix set to `djangocms_blog_agenda`.* A new post list view was created for the Agenda view, it includes all the posts where the `event_date` is set to a date in the future.* Another view is available at `_(&quot;/past/&quot;)`, that will display each post where the `event_date` is in the past.* The templates are *not* in `djangocms_blog/templates` anymore, but in `djangocms_blog_agenda/templates`. Something's not appearing on your templates? Try to edit the file in `djangocms_blog_agenda/templates/`!* We removed the mention of comments &amp; liveblog in the admin form, because we're not using this.* We use some very special bits of code that are using some internal features of djangocms-blog (see `misc.py`, and `apps.py`). Try the module before pushing an update.----## Config### MultisiteThis modules handles multisite just fine; just add `BLOG_MULTISITE = True` in your settings, and our module will inject the `get_site` function directly inside the class returned by `get_user_model()`!You will then need to create a new &quot;Global Page Permission&quot; entry with your user/group, and to select the site where the user/group will have the right to post new articles/agenda posts.*If you're curious about this function, [here it is](djangocms_blog_agenda/apps.py).*</longdescription>

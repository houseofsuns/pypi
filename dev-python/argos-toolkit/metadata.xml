	<longdescription># Argos: tracking multiple objects ([documentation](https://argos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))Argos is a free, open source software toolkit to facilitate trackingmultiple objects (animals) in videos. It is distributed in two packages, this, providing tools for videocapture, annotation of training dataset, and review and correction oftracks detected automatically by the Argos Tracking tool. The otherpackage is the Argos Tracking tool, distributed in the package[argos-tracker](https://github.com/subhacom/argos_tracker).It is described in this article: ```Ray, S., &amp; Stopfer, M. A. (2021). Argos: A toolkit for tracking multiple animals in complex visual environments. Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 00, 1-11. https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13776```Please feel free to create an issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/subhacom/argos/issues) if you have questions,suggestions, or bugs to report.There are many other excellent tools for tracking animal behavior, but Argos:1. Does not require constant background.2. Can use classical segmentation methods like thresholding, contour   detection, and watershed when objects have good contrast with   background.3. Can use a fast Convolutional Neural Network to detect objects in a   noisy environment, or when the objects do not have uniform color.4. Does not assume fixed number of animals: animals can enter and exit   a visual scene.5. Is a complete toolkit with tools to   1. Only capture or extract from videos scenes with significant      movement, reducing the amount of data to be processed.   2. Facilitate generation of training data from images using a GUI.   3. Track animals in videos (as described above) using either a GUI      or in batch mode.   4. Review and correct detected tracks using a GUI.The user documentation for Argos is available on[readthedocs](https://argos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).Argos is in the Public Domain, while the [tracker tool](https://github.com/subhacom/argos_tracker) is released under GPL. Both are free and open source.Instead of reinventing the wheel, we put together algorithms developedby researchers in computer vision in a simple graphical interface tofacilitate the work of biologists.The components of Argos are loosely coupled. Specifically, thetracking does not use neural nets, so no need for training it withvideos. You need to train the neural net for detection if you want touse it, and that can be done with about a hundred training images(here is a jupyter notebook showing how to train Argos/YOLACT onGoogle Colab:https://github.com/subhacom/argos_tutorials/blob/main/ArgosTrainingTutorial.ipynb). Moreover,if your target animal is in the COCO database (sheep, elephant,giraffe, zebra, horse, dog, bird), you can freely download and usepretrained network weights.## Getting started### Installation using Anaconda1. Install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) python distribution. You can    download the free Individual Edition    [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads)2. Create an environment with required packages (enter this commands in    Anaconda prompt):      ```   conda create -n track -c conda-forge python cython scipy numpy scikit-learn pyqt pyyaml matplotlib pandas pytables ffmpeg sortedcontainers   ```      This will create a virtual Python environment called `track`3. Activate the environment (enter this commands in Anaconda prompt):      ```   conda activate track   ```   4. Install OpenCV with contributed modules (required for some recent tracking    algorithms, but not part of the main OpenCV distribution available in conda):   ```commandline    pip install opencv-contrib-python   ```   5. Install PyTorch.   If you have a CUDA capable GPU, see  [pytorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)   to select the  right command. But note that you will need to install the appropriate    [NVIDIA driver](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) for it to work.   In case you do not have a CUDA capable GPU, you have to use   *CPU-only* version (which can be ~10 times slower), in the Anaconda   prompt   ```    conda install pytorch torchvision cpuonly -c pytorch    ``` 6. Install `pycocotools`   On Windows:     1. Install [MS Visual Studio Build Tools](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691126).         Select Windows XX SDK for your version of Windows.     2. Go to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools` and run         `vcbuildtools_msbuild.bat`     3. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)     4. In the Anaconda command prompt run:         ```        pip install git+https://github.com/philferriere/cocoapi.git#egg=pycocotools^&amp;subdirectory=PythonAPI        ```If using PowerShell, use this instead:        ```        pip install &quot;git+https://github.com/philferriere/cocoapi.git#egg=pycocotools&amp;subdirectory=PythonAPI&quot;        ```   On Linux/Unix/Mac you need to have `make` and `g++` installed, and then in    the Anaconda command prompt:      ```   pip install pycocotools   ```7. Install Argos with this command:   ```   pip install argos_toolkit   ```   and the Tracking utility:   ```   pip install argos_tracker   ```   If you want the development versions of these, do this instead:   ```   pip install https://github.com/subhacom/argos/archive/master.zip   pip install https://github.com/subhacom/argos_tracker/archive/master.zip   ```### UsageTo try Argos tracking on objects in COCO dataset, download thepretrained model released with YOLACT[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UYy3dMapbH1BnmtZU4WH1zbYgOzzHHf_/view?usp=sharing)or go to [YOLACT repository](https://github.com/dbolya/yolact) to finda mirror.  The corresponding configuration file is already installedin`{your_python_environment}/lib/site-packages/argos/config/yolact_base/yolact_base_config.yml`.If you used Anaconda as described here, `{your_python_environment}`should be `C:\Users\{username}\Anaconda3\env\track\` for Anaconda3 onWindows, `~/.conda/envs/track` on Linux.You can also download some weights and corresponding configurationfiles here: [Argos example config](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/9fcgouv6wsjvypk/AAC5A2BIrbpdOG5vy8YwOk6ca?dl=0)To run any of the utilities in the Argos toolkit, you have to switchto the Anaconda environment created during the installation:```conda activate track```And then run the utility (except the Tracking tool) as a Python module:```python -m argos.{utility}```Continue reading below, or refer to the documentation for specificcases.#### Interactive trackingThe `argos_track` utility provides a graphicalinterface to set the parameters, choose algorithms for detection(instance segmentation) and tracking, and to view the performance astracking proceeds. Follow the steps below to start and use thisprogram.1. Run `argos` tracking script on the Anaconda prompt:      ```   python -m argos_track   ```   This will start the Graphical User Interface for the   tracker. Follow the steps below in the GUI to track objects while   visualizing the tracking.2. Open the video file using either the `File` menu. After selecting    the video file, you will be prompted to:  1. Select output data directory/file. You have a choice of CSV         (text) or HDF5 (binary) format. HDF5 is recommended.  2. Select Yolact configuration file, go to the `config`         directory inside argos directory and select         `yolact_base/yolact_base_config.yml`.  3. File containing trained network weights, and here you should         select the `yolact_base_54_800000.pth` file downloaded from         YOLACT repository page.  3. Start tracking: click the `play/pause` button and you should see    the tracked locusts. The data will be saved in the filename you    entered in step above.    If you choose CSV above, the bounding boxes of the segmented    objects will be saved in `{videofile}.seg.csv` with each row    containing `frame-no,x,y,w,h` where (x, y) is the coordinate of    the top left corner of the bounding box and `w` and `h` are its    width and height respectively.        The tracks will be saved in `{videofile}.trk.csv`. Each row in this file     contains `frame-no,track-id,x,y,w,h`.If you choose HDF5 in step 10.1 above, the same data will be saved    in a single file compatible with the Pandas library. The    segementation data will be saved in the group `/segmented` and    tracks will be saved in the group `/tracked`. The actual values    are in the dataset named `table` inside each group, with columns    in same order as described above for CSV file. You can load the    tracks in a Pandas data frame in python with the code fragment:```tracks = pandas.read_hdf(tracked_filename, 'tracked')```     4. Classical segmentation: Using the `Segmentation method` menu you can switch    from YOLACT to classical image segmentation for detecting target objects.     This method uses patterns in the pixel values in the image to detect     contiguous patches. If your target objects are small but have high contrast     with the background, this may give tighter bounding boxes, and thus more     accurate tracking.        When this is enabled, the right panel will allow you to set the parameters.        The classical segmentation works by first blurring the image so that sharp     edges of objects are smoothed out. Blur width and SD control this.        Select invert thresholding for dark objects on light background.        Segmentation method: if Threshold, then contiguous white pixels are taken     as objects. If DBSCAN, the DBSCAN algorithm is used for spatially     clustering the white pixels. This usually provides finer selection of    object at the cost of speed.         When DBSCAN is chosen, only clusters of at least `minimum samples`pixels     are considered valid.        The initial segmentation is further refined by specifying limits on object     size by specifying `minimum pixels`, `maximum pixels`, `minimum width`,     `maximum width`, `minimum length` and `maximum length`.#### Batch tracking You can also run the tracking in batch mode from the commandline. This is useful for processing a number of files from a shellscript. This uses YOLACT for decteting objects and SORT for tracking.```python -m argos_track.batchtrack -i {input_file} -o {output_file} -c {yolact_config} -w {yolact_weights} -s {score} -k {max_objects} --hmin {minimum_height} --hmax {maximum_height} --wmin {minimum_width} --wmax {maximum_width} --overlap {minimum_overlap} --max_age {maximum_misses}```where every entry inside braces is to be replaced by the appropriatevalue. The arguments are described below (full list can be obtained bythe command `python -m argos_track.batchtrack -h`)- `input_file`: path of input video file- `output_file`: path of output data- `yolact_config`: path of yolact configuration file (as described above  in step 10)- `yolact_weights`: path of yolact trained weights/network file (as  described above in step 10.3)- `score`: a decimal fraction between 0 and 1 specifying acceptable detection  score. 0.15 is more lenient and 0.75 is more strict. For weights  trained to detect a single object 0.15 to 0.3 can be usable.- `max_objects`: maximum number of object to retain. This keeps at most top k  objects with maximum detection score.- `minimum_height`: an integer - filter out detected objects whose  bounding box has length in pixels less than this number.  - `maximum_height`: an integer - filter out detected objects whose  bounding box has length in pixels larger than this number.  - `minimum_width`: an integer - filter out detected objects whose  bounding box has width in pixels less than this number.- `maximum_width`: an integer - filter out detected objects whose  bounding box has width in pixels larger than this number.- `minimum_overlap`: a decimal fraction between 0 and 1 - the minimum  overlap between two overlapping objects in successive frames to  consider them the same object. This overlap is measured as the ratio  of intersection to union of their bounding boxes. Smaller value will  be lenient, larger value will be stricter.     Imagine object A in frame 1 has moved in frame 2 to A'. If the area  of overlap of the bounding boxes of A and A' is half their combined  area, and the specified minimum overlap is 0.3, then A' will be  correctly labeled the same as A. If the specified minimum overlap is  0.7, then A' will be considered a different object and will receive  a new label.    Thus with a larger value for overlap, a small movement may cause the  object to be labeled as a new object. A smaller value of overlap may  cause different objects coming close together to be confused as the  same object.  - maximum_misses: if an object cannot be detected in these many  successive frames, it is considered lost. It can be smaller when  detection is good and the video is recorded at high FPS.  Example:For detecting animals that should be within 5 and 50 pixels wide andbetween 10 and 100 pixels long, with the yolact configuration file in`config/yolact_config.yml` and weights of a network trained to detectthese animals in `config/weights.pth`, the recorded video in`myvideo.avi`, where we know that no more than 20 animals (includingmisdetection of other objects as the animal, e.g. a scratch in thearena) should be detected in the video, the following command maywork:```python -m argos_track.batchtrack -i myvideo.avi -o myvideo.h5 -c config/yolact.yml -w config/weights.pth -s 0.3 -k 20 --hmin 10 --hmax 100 --wmin 5 --wmax 50 --overlap 0.3 --max_age 20```This will give a new label to an object if it is missing for 20 framesor more. If there are misdetections, they can be corrected manually bythe `review` tool described below.Before embarking on processing a series of similar videos in batchmode, it is a good idea to track a few of them in interactive modedescribed earlier in order to estimate, by trial and error, thecommand line arguments like minimum and maximum height and width,overlap and maximum number of objects.## Additional utilities### Capture video with timestamp for each frame- `capture.py` : a python script to record from a webcam or convert an   existing video based on movement. For very long recordings it may   be wasteful to record video when there is nothing happening. You   can use this script to record or convert video so only parts where   there is some minimum change of pixels (for example due to   movement) are stored. Alongside the output video, it keeps a `.csv`   file with the time of each frame. Check the source code or enter   `python argos/capture.py -h` to find the command line arguments.### Review tracks to manually correct mislabelings`review.py` : a Python/Qt GUI to go through the automatically detectedtracks and correct mistakes.1. Follow steps under `Usage` above after installation to prepare for   running the reviewer.2. Start the GUI using the command  ```  python -m argos.review  ```3. From the File menu open the track generated by `argos_track` and it   will ask for the corresponding video file.      Once both are selected, you will see the current frame in the right   pane and the previous frame in the left pane (initially empty).4. Press Play (keyboard shortcut: `space bar`) to start going through the video.Some videos demonstrating how to use the Review tool in complex scenarios: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdh_edYAAElVLiBgBnLLKZY8VflMm1-LU### Important items in Menu/Toolbar- `Scroll views together` - zooming will work simultaneously on both   left and right pane, scrolling right pane will scroll the left one   too. Useful for comparing the same regions in a zoomed in video.   -  `Set color` button for selecting a single color for all bounding   boxes and track label text.-  `Autocolor` button when checked, will automatically pick random   colors.      `Colormap` button for selecting a colormap and number of different   values to use from this colormap for the bounding boxes and track   label text.-   `Show in grayscale` will show the video in gray. Helps when the   colors of bboxes and labels are too similar to the colors in the   video.- If the `Show popup message for left/right mismatch` button is  checked (default), then it will show a popup message each time the  track ids in the current frame do not match those on the left frame  and the video will pause.   - If `Show popup message for new track` button is checked, then only  when a new track appears on the right pane, the video will pause a  popup message will inform you about it.   - If `No popup message for tracks` button is checked, then the video  will run silently.   - Whenever there is a left-right mismatch in track labels, there will  be a message in the status bar (a status message) pointing out the  differences. In the message text, new track labels will be in bold.- In case a track has been mislabeled, you can drag and drop the  correct label pressing the left mouse button from the list of all  tracks in the middle to the corresponding track id in the list of  current tracks in the right list.     - To apply this for just the current frame, keep the `Shift` key  pressed when dragging and dropping.     - If a track on the right is a false detection, you can delete it by  pressing `x` or `delete` key.       To apply this for current frame only keep the `Ctrl` key pressed at  the same time.- Sometimes the identities of two objects that are too close together  or cross each other, can be swapped by mistake. You can use the  right mouse button to drag and drop one track id from the left/all  list on another on the right list to swap them.       To apply this for just the current frame, keep the `Shift` key  pressed when dragging and dropping.          *NOTE* Swapping and assigning on the same trackid within a single     frame can be problematic.  Sometimes the tracking algorithm can     temporarily mislabel tracks. For example, object `A` (trackid=1)     crosses over object `B` (trackid=2) and after the crossover     object `A` got new label as trackid=3, and object `B` got     mislabelled as trackid=1. The best order of action here is to (a)     swap 3 and 1, and then (b) assign 2 to 3. This is because     sometimes the label of `B` gets fixed automatically by the     algorithm after a couple of frames. Since the swap is applied     first, `B`'s 3 becomes 1, but there is no 1 to be switched to 3,     thus there is no trackid 3 in the tracks list, and the assignment     does not happen, and `A` remains 2. Had we first done the     assignment and then the swap, `B` will get the label 2 from the     assignment first, and as `A` also has label 2, both of them will     become 1 after the swap. - To undo the changes made in current frame press `Ctrl+Z`. Note that  this will undo all operations (swap, assignment, deletion)  specified in the current frame.- By default the reviewer only shows the current tracks on the right  and previous frame's tracks on the left. In order to display tracks  from past frames, check the `Show old tracks` button in the toolbar  or the item in *View* menu.- You can select `View-&gt;Show list of changes` (keyboard `Alt+C`) to  display all the delete, assign and swap operations you suggested  till the current frame. These are applied during the display of  tracks, and when you save the data from `File-&gt;Save reviewed data`,  the data will be saved after applying all these changes. You can  also save the changes in a text file. This is useful if you are  unsure of the changes you are making, and do not want to make  permanent modifications or go through relatively slow full save of  all track data. You can load the original track file later and load  the change list, and these changes will be applied when you play the  video.- `View-&gt;Set old track age limit` will allow you to enter the number  of past frames from which old tracks will be shown when the `Show  old tracks` menu item is selected. This helps avoid visual clutter,  but if too short, you will miss a track id that was lost from  detection for longer than these many frames. The optimal number will  depend on the quality of the original tracking, but starting with  something between 200 and 500 may help.- Selecting a trackid in the right track list will show the positions  of this track label across the entire dataset in the right pane  using a colormap with color value gradually changing with age. (TODO  check)- Selecting a trackid in the middle track list will show the positions  of this track label across the entire dataset in the left pane using  a colormap with color value gradually changing with age. (TODO  check)- Note that the changes like swap, assign and delete are consolidated  only when you save the data to a file. If the tracking algorithm  lost trackid 34 in frame 1000, and relabeled it 40 in frame 1001  till frame 2000, even if you assigned 34 to 40, selecting 34 in the  middle track list (all tracks) will display its positions only up to  frame 1000 in the left pane. However, if you save the data into a  file after the assigment, and then select 34 in the all tracks list,  positions of track 34 will be displayed all the way to frame 2000.- Filtering out bad tracks by ROI: if there is too much noise outside  the area of interest in the video, and the tracker misclassified  these as valid tracks, you can draw a polygon in the right pane over  the video frame (after pausing the video). Click the left mouse  button to place a vertex of the polygon, at the end click it again at  the first vertex to complete the polygon. This will be the region of  interest and any object whose bounding box is entirely outside this  region of interest will be excluded.- Filtering out bad tracks by size: if your objects of interest have a  specific size range, you can filter out bad detections by setting a  size limit via `View-&gt;Size limits`. - `plot_tracks.py` : a python script with functions to display the tracks.## Known-issues- I get the error message when switching to CSRT:  `AttributeError: module 'cv2.cv2' has no attribute 'TrackerCSRT_create'`  - You have installed the standard opecv / python-opencv /opencv-python package.    For CSRT you need opencv with contribute modules. Try:    ```    conda remove opencv-python    pip install opencv-contrib-python    ```- I get this exception when running argos after installation  ```  ValueError: numpy.ndarray size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility. Expected 88 from C header, got 80 from PyObject  ```  This happens with older version of numpy (should be 1.20 or later).   Try upgrading numpy:  ```  pip install -U numpy  ```- When installing with `pip` I get this error message   ```  Collecting torch    Downloading torch-1.8.0-cp39-cp39-manylinux1_x86_64.whl (735.5 MB)    ERROR: THESE PACKAGES DO NOT MATCH THE HASHES FROM THE REQUIREMENTS FILE.

Also note that  CUDA does not work from Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). In  general it is a good idea to install Argos on the native platform.    - Trying to train YOLACT raises this RuntimeError:   ```  RuntimeError: Expected a 'cuda' device type for generator but found 'cpu'.  ```    This is a known bug in pytorch as of version 1.9.0 (see  https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/44714).

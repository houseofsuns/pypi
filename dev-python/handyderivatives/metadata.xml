	<longdescription># handyderivatives[PyPi link](https://pypi.org/project/handyderivatives/)A command line program to do some differential calculus.This is essentially a wrapper for some of [SymPy's](https://github.com/sympy/sympy) calculus tools.[Here is SymPy's calculus documentation.](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorial/calculus.html)*Right now it has the functionality listed below.*- Differentiate elementary functions.- Get the gradient of a scalar field.## Installation```pip3 install handyderivatives```## Running itTo get the derivatives for an arbitrary number of functions of a single variable.```handyderivatives -d 'f(x) = x ^ 2' 'g(x) = sin(x) + 2 * x'```To get the gradient for an arbitrary number of scalar functions.```handyderivatives -g 'f(x,y,z) = ln(x / (2 * y)) - z^2 * (x - 2 * y) - 3*z'```Or run that with one command.```handyderivatives -d 'f(x) = x ^ 2' 'g(x) = sin(x) + 2 * x' -g 'f(x,y,z) = ln(x / (2 * y)) - z^2 * (x - 2 * y) - 3*z'```To differentiate a list of functions in a file and output that to a LaTeX document.```handyderivatives --latex -f functions.txthandyderivatives -l -f functions.txt```The `-l` flag can also be used in the earlier examples.### Help```usage: handyderivatives [-h] [--input-file FILE] [--latex] [--diff [DIFFERENTIAL [DIFFERENTIAL ...]]] [--gradient [GRADIENT [GRADIENT ...]]]Command line differential calculus tool using SymPy.Try running:handyderivatives -l -g 'f(x,y) = sin(x) * cos(y)'optional arguments:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  --input-file FILE, -f FILE                        Input file  --latex, -l           Compile a LaTeX document as output  --diff [DIFFERENTIAL [DIFFERENTIAL ...]], -d [DIFFERENTIAL [DIFFERENTIAL ...]]                        Works for equations written in the form  'f(x) = x ^2'  --gradient [GRADIENT [GRADIENT ...]], -g [GRADIENT [GRADIENT ...]]                        Works for scalar functions written in form  'f(x,y,z) = x ^2 * sin(y) * cos(z)'```## How the input file should be formattedEdit a file that has functions listed one per line.The left hand side should be what your function will be differentiated with respect to, i.e *f(x)* .The right hand side will be the expression.```# This is how the file for the argument -f should be formatted.c(x) = r * (cos(x) + sqrt(-1) * sin(x))a(t) = 1/2 * g * t ** 2f(x) = sin(x**2) * x^2h(w) = E ^ (w^4 - (3 * w)^2 + 9) # Capital E is interpreted by SymPy as the base of the natural log.g(x) = exp(3 * pi)               # So is exp(x), but written as a function taking an argument.p(j) = csc(j^2)```If you don't format it like that you will likely run into errors.You  can add comments.&lt;!--## TODO- Importing things from SymPy takes up a significant amount of time when the program first loads.Right now it's the main bottleneck, maybe there's some way to do this faster.- Add divergence.## Sample PDF![PDF-Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fitzy1293/handyderivatives/main/images/output.png)--&gt;</longdescription>

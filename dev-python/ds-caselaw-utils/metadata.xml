A mergeto main alone will **not** trigger a release to PyPI.To create a release:0. Update the version number in `pyproject.toml`1. Create a branch `release/v{major}.{minor}.{patch}`2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` and `pyproject.toml` for the release3. Commit and push4. Open a PR from that branch to main5. Get approval on the PR6. Tag the HEAD of the PR `v{major}.{minor}.{patch}` and push the tag7. Merge the PR to main and push8. Add a new release to Github for that tag for consistency's sake</longdescription>

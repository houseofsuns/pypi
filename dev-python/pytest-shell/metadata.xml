	<longdescription>============pytest-shell============A plugin for testing shell scripts and line-based processes with pytest.You could use it to test shell scripts, or other commands that can be runthrough the shell that you want to test the usage of.Not especially feature-complete or even well-tested, but works for what Iwanted it for. If you use it please feel free to file bug reports or featurerequests.----This `pytest`_ plugin was generated with `Cookiecutter`_ along with`@hackebrot`_'s `cookiecutter-pytest-plugin`_ template.Features--------* Easy access to a bash shell through a pytest fixture.* Set and check environment variables through Python code.* Automatically fail test on nonzero return codes by default.* Helpers for running shell scripts.* Mostly, all the great stuff pytest gives you with a few helpers to make it  work for bash.Installation------------You can install &quot;pytest-shell&quot; via `pip`_ from `PyPI`_::    $ pip install pytest-shellUsage-----You can use a fixture called 'bash' to get a shell process you can interactwith.Test a bash function::    def test_something(bash):        assert bash.run_function('test') == 'expected output'Set environment variables, run a .sh file and check results::    def test_something(bash):        with bash(envvars={'SOMEDIR': '/home/blah'}) as s:            s.run_script('dostuff.sh', ['arg1', 'arg2'])            assert s.path_exists('/home/blah/newdir')            assert s.file_contents('/home/blah/newdir/test.txt') == 'test text'Run some inline script, check an environment variable was set::    def test_something(bash):        bash.run_script_inline(['touch /tmp/blah.txt', './another_script.sh'])        assert bash.envvars.get('AVAR') == 'success'Use context manager to set environment variables::    def test_something(bash):        with bash(envvars={'BLAH2': 'something'}):            assert bash.envvars['BLAH2'] == 'something'You can run things other than bash (ssh for example), but there aren't specificfixtures and the communication with the process is very bash-specific.Creating file and directory structures--------------------------------------pytest_shell.fs.create_files() is a helper to assemble a structure of files anddirectories. It is best used with the tmpdir pytest fixture so you don't haveto clean up. It is used like so::    structure = ['/a/directory',                 {'/a/directory/and/a/file.txt': {'content': 'blah'}},                 {'/a/directory/and': {'mode': 0o600}]    create_files(structure)which should create something like this::    |    + a       \        + directory         \          + and              # mode 600           \            + a               \                file.txt    # content equal to 'blah'TODO----* Helpers for piping, streaming.* Fixtures and helpers for docker and ssh.* Support for non-bash shells.* Shell instance in setup for e.g. basepath.Refactoring TODO----------------* Make Connection class just handle bytes, move line-based stuff into an  intermediary.* Make pattern stuff work line-based or on multiline streams (in a more  obvious way than just crafting the right regexes).* Make pattern stuff work on part of line if desired, leaving the rest.License-------Distributed under the terms of the `MIT`_ license, &quot;pytest-shell&quot; is free andopen source software.. _`Cookiecutter`: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter.. _`@hackebrot`: https://github.com/hackebrot.. _`MIT`: http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.. _`BSD-3`: http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.. _`GNU GPL v3.0`: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt.. _`Apache Software License 2.0`: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.. _`cookiecutter-pytest-plugin`: https://github.com/pytest-dev/cookiecutter-pytest-plugin.. _`file an issue`: https://github.com/{{cookiecutter.github_username}}/pytest-{{cookiecutter.plugin_name}}/issues.. _`pytest`: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest.. _`tox`: https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.. _`pip`: https://pypi.org/project/pip/.. _`PyPI`: https://pypi.org/project</longdescription>

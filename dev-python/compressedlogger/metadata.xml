	<longdescription>================CompressedLogger================.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/compressedlogger.svg        :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/compressedloggerThis is a logging handler to be used with the standard `python logging &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html&gt;`_ module. The handler creates a log file with the current logs and automatically moves old log files into zipped archives. You can set how many uncompressed logfiles you want to hold and what timespan they should cover. For example you can set each log file to cover three hours and keep four uncompressed logfiles.When the limit of uncompressed logfiles is reached, the oldest uncompressed file will bemoved into a zipped archive file for that day. This way, all logentries for a single day are combined into one zipped file. You can also set a maximum of days to keep the archive files as well as a general size limit for archives. If either one of them is reached, the oldest archives are deleted. Behaviour:----------Using the following configuration:.. code-block:: python   compressed_handler = compressedlogger.CompressedLogger(log_path=&quot;logs/&quot;,          filename=&quot;mylog&quot;,          header=&quot;- - version: 1.2.34 - - -&quot;,         live_log_minutes=300,         live_log_count=3,         max_archive_size_mb=3,         archive_days=2)This will rotate the live log every 300 minutes. When started at 21.9.2020 - 10:33h, the first live log file will be namedmylog-10_33.log. The first rotation will not be at 15:33, but at 15:00. Log rotation timestamp is calculated from 0:00h and not from the start of the application. Therefore, the next live log will be named mylog-15_00.log.So there will be the log files: `mylog-10_33.log`, `mylog-15:00.log`, `mylog-20:00.log`. Because the live logs rotate onday change, the next rotation will happen at 00:00h and not at 01:00h. Once there are more livelogs than in the `max_live_logs` configuration, the latest log will be moved into a compressed archive for that day.The `header` will be written to the top of every archived log. So in this example, there will be the log archive `mylog2020-09-21.log.gz`which will contain one logfile `mylog2020-09-21.log` with the content of [header + mylog-10_33.log +  mylog-15_00.log + mylog-20_00.log].Usage:------Parameters:* log_path: where your logs will be stored* filename: name of you logfile* live_log_minutes: timespan that is covered by a single live-log* live_log_count: maximum number of live logs to keep uncompressed* max_archive_size_mb: maximum combined size of archived logs, in megabyte* archive_days: maximum of days to keep log archives* header: this header will be written on top of every archived logCredits-------This package was created with Cookiecutter_ and the `audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`_ project template... _Cookiecutter: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter.. _`audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage=======History=======0.3.4 (2020-10-23)------------------* when rotating a log file, read and write old logs chunkwise to lower RAM usage0.3.3 (2020-10-23)------------------* check for log rotation everytime a new log is opened0.3.2 (2020-10-08)------------------* timestamps as &quot;10_00&quot; instead of &quot;10:00&quot; for windows compatibility0.3.1 (2020-09-21)------------------* rework whole behaviour0.2.9 (2020-09-10)------------------* add new parameter 'maximum_days'* update readme0.2.8 (2020-07-28)------------------* add missing support of logging formatters* fix the naming of logfiles if more than one handler writes into a log path0.2.5 (2020-07-15)------------------* updated project information and readme0.2.0 (2020-07-15)------------------* some improvements concerning the log paths and log file names0.1.0 (2020-07-14)------------------* First release on PyPI.</longdescription>

	<longdescription>[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/daneads/pycallgraph2.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/daneads/pycallgraph2)# Python Call GraphNote: This is a fork of the original [pycallgraph](https://github.com/gak/pycallgraph) since it became unmaintained.Welcome! pycallgraph2 is a [Python](http://www.python.org) module that creates [call graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_graph) visualizations for Python applications.## Project StatusThe project lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/daneads/pycallgraph2), where you can [report issues](https://github.com/daneads/pycallgraph2/issues), contribute to the project by [forking the project](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) then creating a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests), or just browse the source code.The fork needs documentation. Feel free to contribute :)License: [GNU GPLv2](LICENSE)## Features* Support for Python 2.7+ and Python 3.3+.* Static visualizations of the call graph using various tools such as Graphviz and Gephi.* Execute pycallgraph from the command line or import it in your code.* Customisable colors. You can programatically set the colors based on number of calls, time taken, memory usage, etc.* Modules can be visually grouped together.* Easily extendable to create your own output formats.## Quick StartOS dependencies:* Graphviz is open source software and can be installed on Ubuntu/Debian via `apt install graphviz`, or equivalent on other distributions.  [See here for more information](https://graphviz.org/download/).Installation is easy as:    pip install pycallgraph2The following examples specify graphviz as the outputter, so it's required to be installed. They will generate a file called `pycallgraph.png`.The command-line method of running pycallgraph is::    $ pycallgraph graphviz -- ./mypythonscript.pyA simple use of the API is::    from pycallgraph2 import PyCallGraph    from pycallgraph2.output import GraphvizOutput    with PyCallGraph(output=GraphvizOutput()):        code_to_profile()## DocumentationDocumentation for the fork is a work in progress.</longdescription>

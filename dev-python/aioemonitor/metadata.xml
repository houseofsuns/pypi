([Repo Settings](https://github.com/bdraco/aioemonitor/settings))-   Register your project with PyPI:    -   Make an account on [pypi.org](https://pypi.org)    -   Go to your GitHub repository's settings and under the        [Secrets tab](https://github.com/bdraco/aioemonitor/settings/secrets/actions),        add a secret called `PYPI_TOKEN` with your password for your PyPI account.        Don't worry, no one will see this password because it will be encrypted.    -   Next time you push to the branch `main` after using `bump2version`, GitHub        actions will build and deploy your Python package to PyPI.#### Suggested Git Branch Strategy1. `main` is for the most up-to-date development, very rarely should you directly   commit to this branch. GitHub Actions will run on every push and on a CRON to this   branch but still recommended to commit to your development branches and make pull   requests to main. If you push a tagged commit with bumpversion, this will also release to PyPI.2. Your day-to-day work should exist on branches separate from `main`. Even if it is   just yourself working on the repository, make a PR from your working branch to `main`   so that you can ensure your commits don't break the development head. GitHub Actions   will run on every push to any branch or any pull request from any branch to any other   branch.3. It is recommended to use &quot;Squash and Merge&quot; commits when committing PR's. It makes   each set of changes to `main` atomic and as a side effect naturally encourages small   well defined PR's.**Apache Software License 2.0**</longdescription>

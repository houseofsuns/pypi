	<longdescription>OpenSesame Plug-in: Parallel Port Trigger==========*An OpenSesame plug-in for sending stimulus synchronization triggers through the parallel port to data acquisition systems.*  Copyright, 2022, Bob Rosbag  Contributions: Code is based on the work of Per Sederberg. Debugged and polished by Edwin Dalmaijer.## 1. About--------In EEG/ERP studies it is common to send triggers to mark the timestamp for significant events (e.g., the onset of a trial, presentation of a particular stimulus, etc.). Triggers are typically bytes that are sent via the parallel port to data acquisition systems.The plug-in has an *init* item which should be placed at the beginning of an experiment and a *trigger* item for initiating triggers:- *Dummy mode* for testing experiments.- *Port adress* for Windows: hexadecimal or decimal value, for Linux: full path or port number.- *Value* is a positive integer between 1-255 and specifies the trigger byte.- *Enable duration* option to enable the duration parameter.- *Duration* is the duration in ms.Linux and Windows are supported (possible also OSX, not tested). For Windows the `DLPortIO.dll` driver is used to access the parallel port. No need for driver installation.Documentation: &lt;http://osdoc.cogsci.nl/devices/triggers/&gt;## 2.

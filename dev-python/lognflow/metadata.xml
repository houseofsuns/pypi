You can install it by:.. code-block:: pythonpip install lognflowA simple program to use it would be similar to the following:.. code-block:: pythonfrom lognflow import lognflowimport numpy as npvec = np.random.rand(100)logger = lognflow('c:\\test\\')logger('This is a test for lognflow and log_var')logger.log_single('vec', vec)The logviewer is also very useful... code-block:: pythonfrom lognflow import logviewerlogged = logviewer('c:\\test\\some_log\')vec = logged.get_single('vec')The printprogress makes a pretty nice progress bar... code-block:: pythonfrom lognflow import printprogressN = 100pbar = printprogress(N)for _ in range(N):# do_something()pbar()In this package we use a folder on the HDD to generate files and folders in typicalformats such as numpy npy and npz, png, ... to log. A log viewer is also availbleto turn an already logged flow into variables. Obviously, it will read the folders and map them for you, which is something you could spend hours to do by yourself.Also there is the nicest progress bar, that you can easily understandand use or implement yourself when you have the time.Looking at most logging packages online, you see that you need to spend a lot of timelearning how to use them and realizing how they work. Especially when you have to dealwith http servers and ... which will be a huge pain when working for companieswho have their own HPC. This is why lognflow is handy and straight forward.Many tests are avialable in the tests directory.* Free software: GNU General Public License v3* Documentation: https://lognflow.readthedocs.io.Features--------* lognflow puts all the logs into a directory on your pc* lognflow makes it easy to log text or simple plots.* logviewer makes it easy to load variables or directories* printprogress is one of the best progress bars in Python.Credits^^^^^^^^This package was created with Cookiecutter_ and the `audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`_ project template... _Cookiecutter: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter.. _`audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackageHistory=======0.1.0 (2022-11-16)------------------* First release on PyPI.0.3.0 (2022-12-19)------------------* Very consistent and easy-to-handle interface0.3.2 (2022-12-27)------------------* log your dictionary.0.5.2 (2023-01-11)------------------* logger call takes txt only for the main_log* main_log name can have no time_stamp* All logs can be force_flush = True.* __del__ is well implemented.0.5.3 (2023-03-19)------------------* use logger.log_single('aName', aDict) to save a dictionary using numpy.savez* time_in_file_name has been changed to time_tag, sorry there! but early stages.* time_tag is True in the constructor, but could always be set to False* All tests passed!0.6.0 (2023-03-22)------------------* This is a stable release* All text files are handled by thw with statement* Renaming bug is fixed* all tests run properly.* lognflow has all that logviewer has. We will check if dir exists at every use0.6.1 (2023-03-22)------------------* rename had a bug that is fixed0.6.2 (2023-03-25)------------------* made it possible to flush_all()* We support Python 3.7+ because of dataclasses* printprogress now can disable printing anything and return ETA at the __call__0.6.3 (2023-04-01)------------------* lognflow class does all logviewer does. Maybe it is time to remove logviewer.0.6.4 (2023-04-10)------------------* Better documentation and examples for readme* get_var is added to lognflow</longdescription>

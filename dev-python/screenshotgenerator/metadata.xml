	<longdescription># screenshotgeneratorThis project aims to automate the selection of video screenshots. It employs `ffmpeg` to generate a pool of screenshots then calls on two `autogluon` machine learning models to score the screenshots in order to select the best of them. The first model attempts to determine whether a screenshot is focused while the second model attempts to determine whether the screenshot is a portrait (a close-up of one or more people). The focused model's score makes up 75% of the total score while the portrait model's score makes up 25% of the total score.## DependenciesThe following must be installed on your system:- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)- [MediaInfo](https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo)- [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist) (if you're on Windows)### CUDA`autogluon` uses the CPU version of PyTorch, by default. If you have a CUDA-enabled GPU, installing the CUDA version of PyTorch may increase prediction speed:```pip install torch==1.13.1+cu116 torchvision==0.14.1+cu116 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116```## Usage### CLI```Usage: screenshotgenerator [OPTIONS]Options:  --end-time [%H:%M:%S]           The time at which to stop taking                                  screenshots. Defaults to 95% of the video                                  duration, to exclude credits.  --ffmpeg-path TEXT              The path to ffmpeg. Defaults to 'ffmpeg',                                   which requires ffmpeg to be in your path.  --models-directory TEXT         The path to the directory containing the                                  autogluon models. If the directory doesn't                                  exist, the pretrained models will be                                  downloaded to this location. Defaults to a                                   subdirectory in the user data directory.  --pool-directory TEXT           The directory in which to store the                                  screenshot pool. Defaults to the temporary                                   directory.  --pool-report-path TEXT         A JSON file detailing the screenshot pool,                                  sorted by descending preference.  --pool-size INTEGER             The size of the pool from which to select                                  screenshots.  [default: 64]  --portrait-preference [mixed|noportrait|portrait]                                  Preference regarding portrait screenshots.                                  [default: portrait]  --screenshot-count INTEGER      The number of screenshots to select.                                  [default: 4]  --screenshot-directory TEXT     The directory into which to copy the                                  selected screenshots.  [required]  --silent                        Suppress ffmpeg and autogluon output.  --start-time [%H:%M:%S]         The time at which to start taking                                  screenshots.  [default: 00:00:00]  --video-path TEXT               The path to the video for which to generate                                  screenshots.  [required]  --help                          Show this message and exit.```#### Example```screenshotgenerator --screenshot-directory &quot;B:\Screenshots&quot; --video-path &quot;Z:\Encodes\A Great Movie (2023).mkv --portrait-preference mixed```### LibraryThe library provides the following:- `generate` function- `PortraitPreference` enum- `Screenshot` class#### Parameters- **`screenshot_directory: str`**  The directory into which to copy the selected screenshots.- **`video_path: str`**  The path to the video for which to generate screenshots.- _`end_time: datetime`_  The time at which to stop taking screenshots. Defaults to 95% of the video duration, to exclude credits.- _`ffmpeg_path: str`_  The path to `ffmpeg`. Defaults to 'ffmpeg', which requires `ffmpeg` to be in your path.- _`models_directory: str`_The path to the directory containing the autogluon models. Defaults to a subdirectory in the user data directory.  If the directory doesn't exist, the pretrained models will be downloaded to this location. - _`pool_directory: str`_  The directory in which to store the screenshot pool. Defaults to the temporary directory.- _`pool_size: int`_  The size of the pool from which to select screenshots. Defaults to 64.- _`portrait_preference: PortraitPreference`_  Preference regarding portrait screenshots. Defaults to `PortraitPreference.PORTRAIT`.- _`screenshot_count: int`_  The number of screenshots to select. Defaults to 4.- _`silent: bool`_  True to suppress `ffmpeg` and `autogluon` output. Defaults to false.- _`start_time: datetime`_  The time at which to start taking screenshots. Defaults to 00:00:00.#### Returns`list[Screenshot]` The screenshot pool, sorted by descending preference.#### Example```import screenshotgeneratorscreenshots = screenshotgenerator.generate(    screenshot_directory=r&quot;B:\Screenshots&quot;,    video_path=r&quot;Z:\Encodes\A Great Movie (2023).mkv&quot;,    portrait_preference = screenshotgenerator.PortraitPreference.MIXED)```</longdescription>

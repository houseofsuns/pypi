	<longdescription># ĀrtapĀrtap is a framework for robust design optimization in Python. It contains an integrated, multi-physical FEM solver: Agros suite, furthermore it provides simple interfaces for commercial FEM solvers (COMSOL) and meta-heuristic, bayesian or neural network based optimization algorithms surrogate modelling techniques and neural networks.## InstallationArtap and its dependencies are available as wheel packages for Windows and Linux* distributions:We recommend to install Artap under a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).    pip install --upgrade pip # make sure that pip is reasonably new    pip install artap*The Windows versions are only partially, the linux packages are fully supported at the current version.### Linux You can install the full package, which contains the agrossuite package by the following command:    pip install --upgrade pip # make sure that pip is reasonably new    pip install artap[full]## Basic usageThe goal of this example to show, how we can use Artap to solve a simple, bi-objective optimization problem.The problem is defined in the following way [GDE3]:    Minimize f1 = x1    Minimize f2 = (1+x2) / x1    subject to            x1 e [0.1, 1]            x2 e [0, 5]The Pareto - front of the following problem is known, it is a simple hyperbola. This problem is very simple for an Evolutionary algorithm, it finds its solution within 20-30 generations. NSGA - II algorithm is used to solve this example.### The Problem definition and solution with NSGA-II in Ārtap:    class BiObjectiveTestProblem(Problem):        def set(self):            self.name = 'Biobjective Test Problem'                        self.parameters = [{'name':'x_1', 'bounds': [0.1, 1.]},                               {'name':'x_2', 'bounds': [0.0, 5.0]}]            self.costs = [{'name': 'f_1', 'criteria': 'minimize'},                          {'name': 'f_2', 'criteria': 'minimize'}]        def evaluate(self, individual):            f1 = individual.vector[0]            f2 = (1+individual.vector[1])/individual.vector[0]        return [f1, f2]     # Perform the optimization iterating over 100 times on 100 individuals.    problem = BiObjectiveTestProblem()    algorithm = NSGAII(problem)    algorithm.options['max_population_number'] = 100    algorithm.options['max_population_size'] = 100    algorithm.run()## References* [GDE3] Saku Kukkonen, Jouni Lampinen, The third Evolution Step of Generalized Differential Evolution## CitingIf you use Ārtap in your research, the developers would be grateful if you would cite the relevant publications:[1]  Karban, Pavel, David Pánek, Tamás Orosz, Iveta Petrášová, and Ivo Doležel. “FEM based robust design optimization with Agros and Ārtap.” Computers &amp; Mathematics with Applications (2020) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.camwa.2020.02.010.[2] Pánek, David, Tamás Orosz, and Pavel Karban. ” Ārtap: robust design optimization framework for engineering applications.” arXiv preprint arXiv:1912.11550 (2019).### Applications[3] Karban, P., Pánek, D., &amp; Doležel, I.

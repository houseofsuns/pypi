	<longdescription># Automatically get and set GitHub &amp; GitLab personal access tokens/ssh deploy keysHorrible boiler plate to automate 2 tasks in GitHub, and 1 in GitLab:1. Set an ssh deploy key in your GitHub account, such that you can push the   GitLab build status icons to a specific (hardcoded) repository in your GitHub   account.1. Generate and get/export a GitHub personal access token, such that you can   set the commit statuses of your GitHub commits. (This is used to display the   GitLab CI results in your GitHub repository pull requests).1. Get a GitLab runner token in your own GitLab server. (I did not yet find   out how to do that through docker itself using bash only).## Usage: do onceDownload/clone this repository.1. If you don't have pip: open Anaconda prompt and browse to the directory of   this readme:```cd /home/&lt;your path to the repository folder&gt;/```1. To use this package, first make a new conda environment and activate (it   this automatically installs everything you need).```conda env create --file environment.yml```## Usage: do every time you start Anaconda1. Activate the conda environment you created:```conda activate get_gitlab_generation_token```## Usage: do every run (Set ssh-deploy key in GitHub for pushing build status icons)```python -m gitbrowserinteract --d --ssh &lt;the public ssh key that was created&gt;```- The `--d` indicates you are setting the deploy ssh key in GitHub.- The `-ssh &lt;some ssh key&gt;` is used to absorb/take in the public ssh key that  you want to add to github.## Usage: do every runCreate and get GitHub personal access token for setting commit build statuses```python -m gitbrowserinteract -hubcpat```- The `--hubcpat` indicates you are letting GitHub create a personal access  token and storing it.More complete:```shcd $repo_name &amp;&amp; conda deactivate &amp;&amp; conda activate get_gitlab_generation_token \&amp;&amp; python -m gitbrowserinteract --hubcpat -hu $github_username -hp $github_pwdcd $repo_name &amp;&amp; conda deactivate &amp;&amp; conda activate get_gitlab_generation_token \&amp;&amp; python -m gitbrowserinteract --d -hu $github_username -hp $github_pwd```## Usage: do every run (Create and get GitLab runnertoken)```python -m gitbrowserinteract --g```or, to run it from bash as a pip package:```bashpython -m gitbrowserinteract.__main__ --glr```- The `--g` indicates you are letting GitLab generate a personal access token  and storing it.## Testing1. Testing is as simple as running the following command in the root directory   of this repository in Anaconda prompt:```python -m pytest```from the root directory of this project.&lt;!-- Un-wrapped URL's below (Mostly for Badges) --&gt;## UpdatingBuild the pip package with:```pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel# pip install &quot;keyring&gt;=23.11&quot;pip install twine```Install the pip package locally with:```pip install -e .```Upload the pip package to the world with:```rm -r distrm -r buildpython3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheelpython -m twine upload dist/\*```</longdescription>

	<longdescription># DRIVE:This repository contains the source code for the tool DRIVE v1.0.0. Distant Relatedness for Identification and Variant Evaluation (DRIVE) is a novel approach to IBD-based genotype inference used to identify shared chromosomal segments in dense genetic arrays. DRIVE implemented a random walk algorithm that identifies clusters of individuals who pairwise share an IBD segment overlapping a locus of interest. This tool was developed in python by the Below Lab at Vanderbilt University. The documentation for how to use this tool can be found here [DRIVE documentation](https://belowlab.github.io/drive/)## Installing DRIVE:DRIVE is available on PYPI and can easily be installed using the following command:```bashpip install drive-ibd```If the user wishes to develop DRIVE or install the program from source then they can clone the repository. This process is described under the section called &quot;Github Installation&quot; in the documentation.### Reporting issues:If you wish to report a bug or propose a feature you can find templates under the .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE directory.</longdescription>

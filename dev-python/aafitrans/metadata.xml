	<longdescription># Aafitrans (AstroAlign FInd TRANSform)Aafitrans is a Python package that provides a modified version of the `find_transform` function from the Astroalign package. The modifications made to the function are as follows:* The `sep` and `bottleneck` packages are no longer required as dependencies.* Offers greater flexibility by supporting all transformations available in the `skimage` library.* The `seed` parameter can be set during each run to ensure reproducibility of results.* The `kdtree_search_radius` parameter can be set to achieve better and faster matches.I have only made minor modifications to the source code to achieve the above. All credit goes to the original Astroalign authors for developing such amazing software.   ## Please cite:```Astroalign: A Python module for astronomical image registration.Beroiz, M., Cabral, J.

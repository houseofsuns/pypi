	<longdescription># Omnicloud.AirportOmnicloud.Airport is a Python package for handling data transfer to and from cloud storage providers. It provides a set of classes that implement a common interface for working with cloud storage, making it easy to switch between providers and abstract classes for extending self.&lt;br/&gt;## Conception### TerminalIt is an object that provides cloud related features to existing objects. For example:- omnicloud.airport.terminals.Dict contains methods for processing dictionary;- omnicloud.airport.terminals.Pickle - for handling a pickle object.Every terminal is inherited fom his based object: Dict from dict, Pickle from pickle, soyou can use it in your code directly.Each terminals contains one or more Gates.### GateGate is a object that interacts with single cloud.- omnicloud.airport.terminals.Dict.GStorageJSON - with JSON files at the Google CloudStorage bucket;- omnicloud.airport.terminals.Dict.LocalJSON - with local file.### AddonsThe omnicloud.airport is a platform additional terminals or gates can be installedinto that.For more information please read [the developer docs](https://docs.omnicloud.world/projects/py-airport/development).&gt; ## Filling with objects&gt;&gt; The base package omnicloud.airport contains terminals for object from a pretty python only and gates for local files to theme.&gt;&gt; If you need more please install additional packages. For example omnicloud-airport-dict-gcs&gt; to get a gate to Google Cloud Storage for dictionary or omnicloud-airport-pydantic to get a&gt; terminal for pydantic.## Installation &amp; usage```bash linenums=&quot;1&quot;pip3 install --upgrade omnicloud-airport``````py linenum=1from omnicloud.airport.terminals import Dicttest_dict = {}Dict(test_dict).departure('LocalJSON::/tmp::ensure_ascii=False', 'file_name.json')```The first argument of the method departure is a &quot;waybill&quot;. The second is a filename.The waybill is a specification for processing data in string format that contains three elementsseparated by &quot;::&quot;:1) name of class that represented needs gate;2) the place for saving to;3) additional options in format &quot;key=value||key=value||key=b64:...&quot;; it is optional argument.As a waybill well as filename can contains a part of path:```pyDict(test_dict).departure('LocalJSON::/tmp/a::ensure_ascii=False', 'file.json')Dict(test_dict).departure('LocalJSON::/tmp::ensure_ascii=False', 'a/file.json')```Both command in the tutorial above save a data to file &quot;/tmp/a/file.json&quot;For interaction with different storage (cloud provider) you have to change waybill in your configor environment variable:```bashpip3 install omnicloud-airport-gcp```then```pyDict(test_dict).departure('GStorageJSON::gs://bucket::ensure_ascii=False||key_file=...', 'a/file.json')```</longdescription>

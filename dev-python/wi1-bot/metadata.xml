	<longdescription># wi1-botA Discord bot to integrate [Radarr](https://radarr.video/) &amp; [Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv/), allowing commands like !addmovie and !downloads.### Usage1. Copy `config.yaml.template` to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wi1-bot/config.yaml` and set the necessary values.2. `pip install wi1-bot` (or from source: `pip install git+https://github.com/wthueb/wi1-bot.git`)3. `wi1-bot`### Development1. `git clone https://github.com/wthueb/wi1-bot.git`2. `cd wi1-bot/`3. `pip install -e .[dev]`4. `pre-commit install`Requires Python &gt;=3.10.### TODO- have config.discord.users be a dict with 'quotas' and 'name' for *arr tags- Better pushover notifications  - Failures for pretty much everything  - Notifications for grabs/downloads of personal watchlist- Tag user who added movie when it's downloaded  - Would replace Radarr/Sonarr's Discord webhooks  - !notify \&lt;query\&gt; to also be tagged when a movie/show someone else added is downloaded    - react to &quot;added movie/show&quot; instead of having to !notify    - react to notification to stop notifications    - if user tries to add movie that's already present, add them to list to notify    - Would require a DB; don't use tags as those are to strictly track quotas      - DB is useful for caching other information as well- Use Discord slash commands instead of normal text commands  - This is difficult/impossible currently, can't have &quot;conversation&quot; with slash commands- Enforce quotas- Testing  - docker(-compose) for spinning up Sonarr and Radarr instances to test API interactions- Web dashboard for seeing transcode queue, transcode progress, quotas- !linktmdb  - !rate / !ratings (https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/rate-movie)  - !movierec based off of ratings and similar-to-user ratings?    - https://towardsdatascience.com/the-4-recommendation-engines-that-can-predict-your-movie-tastes-109dc4e10c52    - or just use TMDB's API to get recommendations (if that's possible?)- !movieinfo showing user/public ratings and other general info (runtime, cast, director)  - use TMDB API to get movie metadata  - if movie isn't on Radarr, react to message to add it?  - Tautulli API (get_history) to show who has already seen the movie- User leaderboard  - movies/shows added, Tautulli watch counts</longdescription>

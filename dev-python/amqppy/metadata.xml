	<longdescription>amqppy======AMQP simplified client for Python|Version| |Versions| |Status| |Coverage| |License| |Docs|Introduction to amqppy----------------------**amqppy** is a very simplified AMQP client stacked over `Pika &lt;https://github.com/pika/pika&gt;`_. It has been tested with `RabbitMQ &lt;https://www.rabbitmq.com&gt;`_, however it should also work with other AMQP 0-9-1 brokers.The motivation of **amqppy** is to provide a very simplified and minimal AMQP client interface which can help Python developers to implement easily messaging patterns such as:* `Topic Publisher-Subscribers &lt;https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-five-python.html&gt;`_* `RPC Request-Reply &lt;https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-six-python.html&gt;`_Others derivative `messaging patterns &lt;https://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html&gt;`_ can be implemented tunning some parameters of the Topic and Rpc objects.Installing amqppy-----------------**amqppy** is available for download via PyPI and may be installed using easy_install or pip::    pip install amqppyTo install from source, run &quot;python setup.py install&quot; in the root source directory.Documentation-------------**amqppy**  documentation can be found here: `https://amqppy.readthedocs.io &lt;https://amqppy.readthedocs.io&gt;`_Topic Publisher-Subscribers---------------------------This is one of the most common messaging pattern where the publisher publishes message to an AMQP exchange and the subscriber receives only the messages that are of interest. The subscriber's interest is modeled by the *Topic* or in terms of AMQP by the **rounting_key**. .. image:: https://www.rabbitmq.com/img/tutorials/python-five.pngImage from RabbitMQ `Topic tutorial &lt;https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-five-python.html&gt;`_.Topic Subscriber________________Firstly, we need to start the Topic Subscriber (*also known as Consumer*). In **amqppy** the class **amqppy.consumer.Worker** has this duty... code-block:: python    import amqppy    BROKER = 'amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672//'    def on_topic_status(exchange, routing_key, headers, body):        print('Received message from topic \'amqppy.publisher.topic.status\': {}'.format(body))    # subscribe to a topic: 'amqppy.publisher.topic.status'    worker = amqppy.Worker(BROKER)    worker.add_topic(exchange='amqppy.test',                     routing_key='amqppy.publisher.topic.status',                     on_topic_callback=on_topic_status)    # it will wait until worker is stopped or an uncaught exception    worker.run()The subscriber worker will invoke the *on_topic_callback* every time a message is published with a topic that matches with the specified **routing_key**: `'amqppy.publisher.topic.status'`. Note that **routing_key** can contain `wildcards &lt;https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-five-python.html&gt;`_ therefore, one subscriber might be listening a set of *Topics*.Once the topic subscriber is running we able to launch the publisher.Topic Publisher________________.. code-block:: python    import amqppy    BROKER = 'amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672//'    # publish my current status    amqppy.Topic(BROKER).publish(exchange='amqppy.test',                                 routing_key='amqppy.publisher.topic.status',                                 body='RUNNING')The topic publisher will send a message to the AMQP exchange with the Topic **routing_key**: `'amqppy.publisher.topic.status'`, therefore, all the subscribed subscribers will receive the message unless they do not share the same queue. In case they share the same queue a round-robin dispatching policy would be applied among subscribers/consumers like happens in `work queues &lt;https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-two-python.html&gt;`_.RPC Request-Reply-----------------This pattern is commonly known as *Remote Procedure Call* or *RPC*. And is widely used when we need to run a function *request* on a remote computer and wait for the result *reply*... image:: https://www.rabbitmq.com/img/tutorials/python-six.pngImage from RabbitMQ `RPC tutorial &lt;https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-six-python.html&gt;`_RPC Reply_________An object of type **amqppy.consumer.Worker** listens incoming **RPC requests** and computes the **RPC reply** in the *on_request_callback*. In the example below, the RPC consumer listens on Request **rounting_key**:`'amqppy.requester.rpc.division'` and the division would be returned as the RPC reply... code-block:: python    import amqppy    BROKER = 'amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672//'    def on_rpc_request_division(exchange, routing_key, headers, body):        args = json.loads(body)        return args['dividend'] / args['divisor']    # subscribe to a rpc request: 'amqppy.requester.rpc.division'    worker = Worker(BROKER)    worker.add_request(exchange='amqppy.test',                       routing_key='amqppy.requester.rpc.division',                       on_request_callback=on_rpc_request_division)    # it will wait until worker is stopped or an uncaught exception    worker.run()RPC Request___________The code below shows how to do a **RPC Request** using an instance of class *amqppy.publisher.Rpc*.. code-block:: python    import amqppy    BROKER = 'amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672//'    # do a Rpc request 'amqppy.requester.rpc.division'    result = amqppy.Rpc(BROKER).request(exchange='amqppy.test',                                        routing_key='amqppy.requester.rpc.division',                                        body=json.dumps({'dividend': 3.23606797749979, 'divisor': 2.0}))    print('RPC result: {}.'.format(result)).. |Version| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/amqppy.svg?   :target: http://badge.fury.io/py/amqppy.. |Versions| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/amqppy.svg    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/amqppy.. |Status| image:: https://img.shields.io/travis/marceljanerfont/amqppy.svg?   :target: https://travis-ci.org/marceljanerfont/amqppy.. |Coverage| image:: https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/marceljanerfont/amqppy.svg?   :target: https://codecov.io/github/marceljanerfont/amqppy?branch=production.. |License| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/amqppy.svg?   target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/amqppy.. |Docs| image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/amqppy/badge/?version=stable   :target: https://amqppy.readthedocs.org   :alt: Documentation Status</longdescription>

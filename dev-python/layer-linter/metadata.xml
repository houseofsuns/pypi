It does this by analysing the internalimports between all the modules in your code base, and compares thisagainst a set of simple rules that you provide in a ``layers.yml`` file.For example, you can use it to check that no modules inside ``myproject.foo``import from any modules inside ``myproject.bar``, even indirectly.This is particularly useful if you are working on a complex codebase within a team,when you want to enforce a particular architectural style. In this case you can addLayer Linter to your deployment pipeline, so that any code that does not followthe architecture will fail tests.Quick start-----------Install Layer Linter::    pip install layer-linterDecide on the dependency flows you wish to check. In this example, we haveorganised our project into three subpackages, ``myproject.high``, ``myproject.medium``and ``myproject.low``. These subpackages are known as *layers*. Note: layers musthave the same parent package (i.e. all be in the same directory). This parent is known as a *container*.Create a ``layers.yml`` in the root of your project. For example::    My Layers Contract:      containers:        - myproject      layers:        - high        - medium        - low(This contract tells Layer Linter that the order of the layers runs from ``low`` at the bottomto ``high`` at the top. Layers higher up can import ones lower down, but not the other way around.)Note that the container is an absolute name of a Python package, while the layers are relative to the container.Now, from your project root, run::    layer-lint myprojectIf your code violates the contract, you will see an error message something like this::    ============    Layer Linter    ============    ---------    Contracts    ---------    Analyzed 23 files, 44 dependencies.    -----------------------------------    My layer contract BROKEN    Contracts: 0 kept, 1 broken.    ----------------    Broken contracts    ----------------    My layer contract    -----------------    1. myproject.low.x imports myproject.high.y:        myproject.low.x &lt;-        myproject.utils &lt;-        myproject.high.yFor more details, see `Usage`_... _Usage: https://layer-linter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html=======History=======0.1.0 (2018-06-20)------------------* First release on PyPI.0.2.0 (2018-06-23)------------------* Look for ``layers.yml`` in current working directory.0.3.0 (2018-06-24)------------------* Renamed command to ``layer-lint``.* Changed order of layers in ``layers.yml`` to be listed high level to low level.0.4.0 (2018-07-22)------------------* Made dependency analysis more efficient and robust.* Improved report formatting.* Removed illegal dependencies that were implied by other, more succinct illegal dependencies.* Added ``--debug`` command line argument.0.5.0 (2018-08-01)------------------* Added count of analysed files and dependencies to report.* Fixed issues from running command in a different directory to the package.* Increased speed of analysis.* Changed ``--config_directory`` command line argument to ``--config-directory``.0.6.0 (2018-08-07)------------------* Added ability to whitelist paths.0.6.1 (2018-08-07)------------------* Added current working directory to path.0.6.2 (2018-08-17)------------------* Don't analyse children of directories that aren't Python packages.* Prevented installing incompatible version of Pydeps (1.6).0.7.0 (2018-09-04)------------------* Completed rewrite of static analysis used to build dependency graph.* Added quiet and verbose reporting.* Added type annotation and mypy.* Built earlier versions of Python using pybackwards.* Corrected docs to refer to ``layers.yml`` instead of ``layers.yaml``.0.7.1 (2018-09-04)------------------* Fixed packaging bug with 0.7.0.0.7.2 (2018-09-05)------------------* Fixed bug with not checking all submodules of layer.0.7.3 (2018-09-07)------------------* Dropped support for Python 3.4 and 3.5 and adjust packaging.0.7.4 (2018-09-20)------------------* Tweaked command line error handling.* Improved README and `Core Concepts` documentation.0.8.0 (2018-09-29)------------------* Replace ``--config-directory`` parameter with ``--config`` parameter, which takes a file name instead.0.9.0 (2018-10-13)------------------* Moved to beta version.* Improved documentation.* Better handling of invalid package names passed to command line.0.10.0 (2018-10-14)-------------------* Renamed 'packages' to 'containers' in contracts.0.10.1 (2018-10-14)-------------------* Improved handling of invalid containers.0.10.2 (2018-10-17)-------------------* Error if a layer is missing.0.10.3 (2018-11-2)------------------* Fixed RST rendering on PyPI.0.11.0 (2018-11-5)------------------* Support defining optional layers.0.11.1 (2019-1-16)------------------* Updated dependencies, especially switching to a version of PyYAML to  address https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-18342.0.12.0 (2019-1-16)------------------* Fix parsing of relative imports within __init__.py files.0.12.1 (2019-2-2)-----------------* Add support for Click 7.x.0.12.2 (2019-3-20)------------------* Fix bug with Windows file paths.0.12.3 (2019-6-8)-----------------* Deprecate Layer Linter in favour of Import Linter.</longdescription>

For example, getting the word on the first guesses rewards 6 points, getting the word on the second guess rewards 5 points, etcThe agent also is rewarded for colors in the current row (so the current guess). Right now, the agent is rewarded 3 points for each green tile, and 1 point for each yellow tile. No points are giving for grey tiles</longdescription>

	<longdescription># ladok3: Python wrapper for LADOK3 APIThis package provides a wrapper for the LADOK3 API used by [start.ladok.se][ladok]. This makes it easy to automate reporting grades, compute statistics etc.## InstallationTo install, run:```bashpip install ladok3sudo cp $(find / -name ladok.bash) /etc/bash_completion.dladok login```If you run the second line above, you'll get tab completion for the `ladok` command when you use the `bash` shell.The third command above is to log in, you only do this once.An alternative to installing the package is to run the [Docker image][docker].```bashdocker run -it dbosk/ladok3 /bin/bash```Or simply adapt your own image.## UsageThere are two ways to use the package: as a Python package or through the command-line tool `ladok`.### On the command lineLet's assume that we have a student with personnummer 123456-1234.Let's also assume that this student has taken a course with course code AB1234 and finished the module LAB1 on date 2021-03-15.Then we can report this result like this:```bashladok report 123456-1234 AB1234 LAB1 -d 2021-03-15 -f```If we use Canvas for all results, we can even report all results for a course.```bashpip install canvaslmscanvaslms logincanvaslms results -c AB1234 -A LAB1 | ladok report -v```The `canvaslms results` command will export the results in CSV format, this will be piped to `ladok report` that can read it and report it in bulk.### As a Python packageTo use the package, it's just to import the package as usual.```pythonimport ladok3ls = ladok3.kth.LadokSession(&quot;user&quot;, &quot;password&quot;)student = ls.get_student(&quot;123456-1234&quot;)course_participation = student.courses(code=&quot;AB1234&quot;)[0]for result in course_participation.results():  print(f&quot;{course_participation.code} {result.component}: &quot;    f&quot;{result.grade} ({result.date})&quot;)component_result = course_participation.results(component=&quot;LAB1&quot;)[0]component_result.set_grade(&quot;P&quot;, &quot;2021-03-15&quot;)component_result.finalize()```## More documentationThere are more detailed usage examples in the details documentation that can be round with the [releases][releases] and in the `examples` directory.[ladok]: https://start.ladok.se[docker]: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/dbosk/ladok3[releases]: https://github.com/dbosk/ladok3/releases# The examplesThere are some examples that can be found in the `examples` directory:  - `example_LadokSession.py` just shows how to establish a session.  - `example_Course.py` shows course data related examples.  - `example_Student.py` shows student data related examples.  - `prgi.py` shows how to transfer grades from KTH Canvas to LADOK.  - `statsdata.py` shows how to extract data for doing statistics for a course     and the students' results.We also have a few more examples described in the sections below.## `canvas_ladok3_spreadsheet.py`Purpose: Use the data in a Canvas course room together with the data from Ladok3 to create a spreadsheet of students in the courseand include their Canvas user_id, name, Ladok3 Uid, program_code, program name, etc.Note that the course_id can be given as a numeric value or a string which will be matched against the courses in the user's dashboard cards. It will first match against course codes, then short name, then original names.Input: ```canvas_ladok3_spreadsheet.py canvas_course_id```Add the &quot;-T&quot; flag to run in the Ladok test environment.Output: outputs a file ('users_programs-COURSE_ID.xlsx) containing a spreadsheet of the users information```canvas_ladok3_spreadsheet.py 12162canvas_ladok3_spreadsheet.py -t 'II2202 HT20-1'```## `ladok3_course_instance_to_spreadsheet.py`Purpose: Use the data in Ladok3 together with the data from Canvas to create a spreadsheet of students in a courseinstance and include their Canvas user_id (or &quot;not in Canvas&quot; if they do not have a Canvas user_id), name, Ladok3 Uid, program_code, program name, etc.Note that the course_id can be given as a numeric value or a string which will be matched against the courses in the user's dashboard cards. It will first match against course codes, then short name, then original names.Input: ```ladok3_course_instance_to_spreadsheet.py course_code course_instance```or```ladok3_course_instance_to_spreadsheet.py canvas_course_id```or```./ladok3_course_instance_to_spreadsheet.py course_code```Optionally include their personnumber with the flag -p or --personnumbers Add the &quot;-T&quot; flag to run in the Ladok test environment.Output: outputs a file ('users_programs-instance-COURSE_INSTANCE.xlsx) containing a spreadsheet of the users information```# for II2202 the P1 instance in 2019 the course instance is 50287ladok3_course_instance_to_spreadsheet.py II2202 50287```or```# Canvas course_id for II2202 in P1 is 20979ladok3_course_instance_to_spreadsheet.py 20979```or```# P1P2 is a nickname on a dashboard card for II2202 duing P1 and P2./ladok3_course_instance_to_spreadsheet.py P1P2```## `canvas_students_missing_integration_ids.py`Purpose: Use the data in a Canvas course room to create a spreadsheet of students in the course who are missing an integration ID.Input: ```canvas_students_missing_integration_ids.py canvas_course_id```Output: outputs a file ('users_without_integration_ids-COURSE_ID.xlsx) containing a spreadsheet of the users information## `cl_user_info.py`Purpose: Use the data in a Canvas course room together with the data from Ladok3 to find information about a user.Input: ```Input cl_user_info.py Canvas_user_id|KTHID|Ladok_id [course_id]```The course_id can be a Canvas course_id **or** if you have dashboard cards, you can specific a course code, a nickname, unique part of the short name or original course name.Add the &quot;-k&quot; or '--kthid' flag to get the KTHID (i.e., the 'sis_user_id) you need to specify a course_id for a course (where this user is a teacher or student) on the command line.Add the &quot;-T&quot; flag to run in the Ladok test environment.If you know the Ladok_id, i.e., the integration_id - then you do not need to specify a course_id.The program can also take an argument in the form https://canvas.kth.se/courses/course_id/users/user_id- this is the URL when you are on a user's page in a course.Output:\&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;from Canvas: sortable name, user_id, and integration_id\&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;if you specified a course_id, you will also get KTHID and login_id\&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;from Ladok:  pnr (personnumber) and [program_code, program_name, specialization/track code, admissions info]</longdescription>

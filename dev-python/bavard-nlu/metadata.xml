	<longdescription># bavard-nlu## Releasing The PackageReleasing the package is automatically handled by CI, but three steps must be taken to trigger a successful release:1. Increment the `VERSION` variable in `setup.py` to the new desired version (e.g. `VERSION=&quot;1.1.1&quot;`)2. Commit and tag the repo with the **exact same** value you populated the `VERSION` variable with (e.g. `git tag 1.1.1`)3. Push the commit and tag to remote. These can be done together using: `git push --atomic origin &lt;branch name&gt; &lt;tag&gt;`CI will then release the package to pypi with that version once the commit and tag are pushed.## Local Development### Install Dependencies```pip3 install -e .pip3 install -r requirements-test.txt```### NLUModel CLIThere is a convenience CLI for training, evaluating, predicting, tuning, and interacting with NLU models. To see the CLI documentation:```python3 -m bavard_nlu.cli --help```You can also view the documentation for a sub-command for example:```python3 -m bavard_nlu.cli train --help```## Testing LocallyThe tests for this repo consist of functional tests for catching bugs/code regressions, and validation tests for catching model performance regressions. The validation tests take much longer to execute. Both are run in CI. To run just the functional tests:```python3 -m unittest discover test/functional```</longdescription>

It sends emails to system administrators if the change is from overdue to delinquent or to maintainers if from due to overdue. It also alerts when there are new candidates for the data grid and reports datasets that are broken or which have invalid maintainers. An email is also sent for organisations with invalid administrators. For more information, please read the [documentation](https://hdx-data-freshness-emailer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This library is part of the [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/) (HDX) project. If you have humanitarian related data, please upload your datasets to HDX.</longdescription>

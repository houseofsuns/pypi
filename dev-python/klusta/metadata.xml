	<longdescription># Klusta: automatic spike sorting up to 64 channels[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/kwikteam/klusta.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/kwikteam/klusta)[![codecov.io](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/kwikteam/klusta.svg)](http://codecov.io/github/kwikteam/klusta?branch=master)[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/klusta/badge/?version=latest)](http://klusta.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)[![PyPI release](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/klusta.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/klusta)[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/kwikteam/klusta.svg)](https://github.com/kwikteam/klusta/releases/latest)[**klusta**](https://github.com/kwikteam/klusta) is an open source package for automatic spike sorting of multielectrode neurophysiological recordings made with probes containing up to a few dozens of sites.We are also working actively on more sophisticated algorithms that will scale to hundreds/thousands of channels. This work is being done within the [phy project](https://github.com/kwikteam/phy), which is still experimental at this point.## Overview**klusta** implements the following features:* **Kwik**: An HDF5-based file format that stores the results of a spike sorting session.* **Spike detection** (also known as SpikeDetekt): an algorithm designed for probes containing tens of channels, based on a flood-fill algorithm in the adjacency graph formed by the recording sites in the probe.* **Automatic clustering** (also known as Masked KlustaKwik): an automatic clustering algorithm designed for high-dimensional structured datasets.## GUIYou will need a GUI to visualize the spike sorting results.We have developed two GUI programs with the same features:* **phy KwikGUI**: newer project, scales to hundreds/thousands of channels, still relatively experimental. **It will be automatically installed if you follow the install instructions below.*** **[KlustaViewa](https://github.com/klusta-team/klustaviewa)**: widely used, but older and a bit hard to install since it relies on very old dependencies.Both GUIs work with the same **Kwik** format.## Quick install guideThe following instructions will install both **klusta** and the **phy KwikGUI**.1. Make sure that you have [**miniconda**](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) installed. You can choose the Python 3.5 64-bit version for your operating system (Linux, Windows, or OS X).2. [Download the environment file.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kwikteam/klusta/master/installer/environment.yml)3. Open a terminal (on Windows, `cmd`, not Powershell) in the directory where you saved the file and type:    ```bash    conda env create -n klusta -f environment.yml    ```4. **Done**! Now, to use klusta and the phy KwikGUI, enter the directory that contains your files and type:    ```bash    source activate klusta  # omit the `source` on Windows    klusta yourfile.prm  # spikesort your data with a PRM file    phy kwik-gui yourfile.kwik  # open the GUI    ```    See the documentation for more details.### Updating the softwareTo get the latest version of the software, open a terminal and type:```source activate klusta  # omit the `source` on Windowspip install klusta phy phycontrib --upgrade```## Technical details**klusta** is written in pure Python. The clustering code, written in Python and Cython, currently lives in [another repository](https://github.com/kwikteam/klustakwik2/).## Links* [Documentation](http://klusta.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) (work in progress)* [Paper in Nature Neuroscience (April 2016)](http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nn.4268.html)* [Mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/klustaviewas)* [Sample data repository](http://phy.cortexlab.net/data/) (work in progress)## Credits**klusta** is developed by [Cyrille Rossant](http://cyrille.rossant.net), [Shabnam Kadir](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=SKADI56), [Dan Goodman](http://thesamovar.net/), [Max Hunter](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=MLDHU99), and [Kenneth Harris](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=KDHAR02), in the [Cortexlab](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/cortexlab), University College London.</longdescription>

	<longdescription># 🍵 TeaMicro HTTP library with WebSocket support for Python.Tea has [Express.js](https://github.com/expressjs/express)-like syntax (which is web framework for JavaScript) with it's callback function syntax, Request, Response and URL objects. Got a lot of reference from popular web frameweorks like [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask), [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) and Express.js. Tea is like lightweight mix of their best features. Of course pretty good with WebSocket support.Finally, the `418 I am a teapot` code comes true. Enjoy!## Quick Start```console$ pip install tea-web```## `Hello, World!`Simple `Hello, World!` example in Tea. See [`/examples`](https://github.com/orhanemree/tea/tree/master/examples) for more example.```python# app.pyfrom tea import Teaapp = Tea()def handle_index(req, res):    res.send(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)app.get(&quot;/&quot;, handle_index)app.listen(port=8080)```## Advantages of Tea* Lightweight. No external requirement and the package cost is only ~10 KB.* More control over the Request, Response and URL objects. This objects can be used outside the library structure.* Easy to use and helpful on handling simple HTTP requests.* Built-in WebSocket support.## Disadvantages of Tea* Limited features and methods.* No template engine.* Callback function syntax is not really Pythonic without decorators. (Done on purpose but true.)* Not sure if it's ready for production.## Documentation* See [DOCUMENTATION.md](https://github.com/orhanemree/tea/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md).## License* Licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/orhanemree/tea/blob/master/LICENSE).</longdescription>

Later Update self.default_voice with the desired voice.id&gt; https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchlp2290/mac#:~:text=Add%20a%20new%20voice,may%20need%20to%20scroll%20down.)- There are a few known issues with NSSS.py and pysstx3.py on macOS Ventura. Until we receive an update with those fixes, below is a temporary workaround for the errors in init stage.In pyttsx3/drivers/nsss.py:```def _toVoice(self, attr) method:    Replace:         return Voice(attr['VoiceIdentifier'], attr['VoiceName'],            [lang], attr['VoiceGender'],            attr['VoiceAge'])    With:        return Voice(attr.get('VoiceIdentifier'), attr.get('VoiceName'),            [attr.get('VoiceLocaleIdentifier', attr.get('VoiceLanguage'))], attr.get('VoiceGender'),            attr.get('VoiceAge'))``````class NSSpeechDriver(NSObject):    Replace:        self = super(NSSpeechDriver, self).init()    With:        self = objc.super(NSSpeechDriver, self).init()```&gt; If the downloader script is broken. As a temporal workaround can manually download the punkt tokenizer from here and &gt;then place the unzipped folder in the corresponding location. &gt;The default folders for each OS are:&gt; &gt;&gt;Windows: `C:\nltk_data\tokenizers`&gt;&gt;&gt; OSX: `/usr/local/share/nltk_data/tokenizers`&gt;&gt;&gt; Unix: `/usr/share/nltk_data/tokenizers`</longdescription>

I was doing so to support`gargoyle-yplan &lt;https://github.com/adamchainz/gargoyle&gt;`__, a fork for myex-employer YPlan. If you'd like to sponsor ongoing maintenance or take it overyourself, please contact me@adamj.eu.``ModelDict`` is a very efficient way to store things like settings in your database. The entire model is transformed into a dictionary (lazily) as well as stored in your cache. It's invalidated only when it needs to be (both in process and based on ``CACHE_BACKEND``).It was originally created by `Disqus &lt;https://github.com/disqus/django-modeldict&gt;`_, but due to the inactivity we at YPlan have taken over maintenance on this fork.Requirements------------Tested with all combinations of:* Python: 3.6* Django: 1.11, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2Python 3.4+ supported.Install-------Install it with **pip**:.. code-block:: bash    pip install django-modeldict-yplanMake sure you ``pip uninstall django-modeldict`` first if you're upgrading from the original to this fork - the packages clash.Example Usage-------------.. code-block:: python    # You'll need a model with fields to use as key and value in the dict    class Setting(models.Model):        key = models.CharField(max_length=32)        value = models.CharField(max_length=200)    # Create the ModelDict...    settings = ModelDict(Setting, key='key', value='value', instances=False)    # And you can treat it like a normal dict:    # Missing values = KeyError    settings['foo']    &gt;&gt;&gt; KeyError    # Sets supported    settings['foo'] = 'hello'    # Fetch the current value using normal dictionary access    settings['foo']    &gt;&gt;&gt; 'hello'    # ...or by normal model queries    Setting.objects.get(key='foo').value    &gt;&gt;&gt; 'hello'=======History=======Pending release---------------.. Add new release notes below here2.0.3 (2019-05-17)------------------* **Retired: this project is no longer maintained.** I (Adam Johnson) no longer  have time to continue maintaining this. I was doing so to support  `gargoyle-yplan &lt;https://github.com/adamchainz/gargoyle&gt;`__, a fork for my  ex-employer YPlan. If you'd like to sponsor ongoing maintenance or take it  over yourself, please contact me@adamj.eu.2.0.2 (2019-04-28)------------------* Tested with Django 2.2. No changes were needed for compatibility.2.0.1 (2019-02-15)------------------* No functional changes. This is a re-release of version 2.0.0 to fix immutable  metadata on PyPI so that Pip on Python 2 doesn't pick up the Python 3 only  2.X series. **Version 2.0.0 will be pulled from PyPI on 2019-03-01.**2.0.0 (2019-01-29)------------------**This version is due to be pulled from PyPI, please use version 2.0.1 as perits above release note.*** Drop Python 2 support, only Python 3.4+ is supported now.* Drop Django 1.8, 1.9, and 1.10 support. Only Django 1.11+ is supported now.* Remove ``iteritems()``, ``iterkeys()``, and ``itervalues()`` methods from  ``ModelDict``, and move ``items()``, ``keys()``, and ``values()`` to Python 3  semantics, returning iterators rather than lists.* Include LICENSE file in wheel.* Tested with Django 2.1. No changes were needed for compatibility.1.5.4 (2016-10-28)------------------* Fixed a race condition in threaded code. See https://github.com/adamchainz/django-modeldict/pull/40 for a detailed  explanation. Thanks @Jaidan.1.5.3 (2016-09-20)------------------* Stop rounding ``time.time()`` down to the nearest integer, so we are more fine grained around expiration. It might  also fix a subtle timing bug around re-fetching the remote cache unnecessarily.1.5.2 (2016-07-31)------------------* Fixed update missing when ``_local_last_updated`` could be set even when it  wasn't updated* Fixed update missing from integer rounding in time comparison* Fixed ``CachedDict.__repr__`` so it works for other subclasses of  ``CachedDict`` than ``ModelDict`` (don't assume ``self.model`` exists)1.5.1 (2016-06-13)------------------* Fixed local cache never expiring if value was checked too often.* Use Django's ``cache.set_many`` for more efficient storage.1.5.0 (2016-01-11)------------------* Forked by YPlan* Fixed concurrency TOCTTOU bug for threaded Django servers.* Stopped including the 'tests' directory in package* Django 1.8 and 1.9 supported.* Python 3 support added.* Fixed ``setdefault()`` to return the value that was set/found, as per normal dict semantics. Thanks @olevinsky.1.4.1 (2012-12-04)------------------* Last release by Disqus</longdescription>

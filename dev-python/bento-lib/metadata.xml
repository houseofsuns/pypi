	<longdescription># Bento Library (for Python Bento microservices)![Test Status](https://github.com/bento-platform/bento_lib/workflows/Test/badge.svg)![Lint Status](https://github.com/bento-platform/bento_lib/workflows/Lint/badge.svg)[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/bento-platform/bento_lib/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/bento-platform/bento_lib)[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/bento-lib.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/bento-lib)Common utilities and helpers for Bento platform services.## Running Tests```bashpython3 -m tox```## Releasing### 1. Release Checklist  * [ ] All tests pass and test coverage has not been reduced  * [ ] Package version has been updated (following semver) in     `bento_lib/package.cfg`      * [ ] The latest changes have been merged from the `develop` branch into the    `master` branch      * [ ] A release has been created, tagged in the format of `v#.#.#` and named    in the format of `Version #.#.#`, listing any changes made, in the GitHub     releases page **tagged from the master branch!**    #### 1A. Note on VersioningThe `bento_lib` project uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) forreleasing. If the API is broken in any way, including minor differences in theway a function behaves given an identical set of parameters (excluding bugfixesfor unintentional behaviour), the MAJOR version must be incremented. In this way, we guarantee that projects relying on this API do not accidentally breakupon upgrading.### 2. Releasing automaticallyWhen a version is tagged on GitHub, a build + release CI pipeline is automatically triggered.Make sure that the tagged version is a valid semantic versioning translation of the version in`package.cfg`, and that the versions otherwise match.## Modules### `auth``auth` provides Python service middleware for dealing with the Bento authorization service.### `drs``drs` provides utilities for fetching data and record metadata from GA4GH-compatible DRS services, and Bento's own implementation (which has some non-standard extensions.)### `events``events` facilitates JSON-serialized message-passing between Bentomicroservices. Serialized objects can be at most 512 MB.Events should have a lower-case type which is type-insensitively unique andadequately describes the associated data.All Bento channels are prefixed with `bento.`.### `responses``responses` contains standardized error message-generating functions and exception handling functions for different Python web frameworks.### `schemas``schemas` contains common JSON schemas which may be useful to a variety ofdifferent Bento services.`schemas.bento` contains Bento-specific schemas, and `schemas.ga4gh` containsGA4GH-standardized schemas (possibly not exactly to spec.)### `search``search` contains definitions, validators, and transformations for the querysyntax for Bento, as well as a transpiler to the `psycopg2` PostgreSQL IR.The query syntax for Bento takes advantage of JSON schemas augmented withadditional properties about the field's accessibility and, in the case ofPostgres, how the field maps to a table column (or JSON column sub-field.)`search.data_structure` contains code for evaluating a Bento query against aPython data structure.`search.operations` contains constants representing valid search operations onecan allow against particular fields from within an augmented JSON schema.`search.postgres` contains a &quot;transpiler&quot; from the Bento query syntax to the`psycopg2`-provided[intermediate representation (IR)](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/sql.html) forPostgreSQL, allowing safe queries against a Postgres database.`search.queries` provides definitions for the Bento query AST and some helpermethods for creating and processing ASTs.### `types``types` contains Python type hints for different standard Bento dictionaries/objects.### `workflows``workflows` contains common code used for handling workflow metadata processingand response generation, as well as code associated with Bento's ingestionroutines across the different data services.</longdescription>

This is the main difference with the *turtle* module, which uses *(t|T)kinter*.Cloning the repository (or retrieving the corresponding ZIP file) is sufficient to use this module. The `main.py` file, with which above picture were generated, is an example of use of this library. Simply launch `python main.py` from the root of the repository.The module is also available on *Pypi*: &lt;https://pypi.org/project/tortoise/&gt;. Simply launch `pip install tortoise` to install it.You can also test the library directly in your web browser, with nothing to install: &lt;http://q37.info/s/dj9b7ksf&gt;.This *Python* module is part of a [larger project](https://q37.info/s/tpkx4cfk) that aims to provide a way to write modern examples or exercises for programming tutorials.The *tortoise* library currently provides following methods (coordinates and distances are relative to the *viewbox* of the SVG):- *constructor*`(dom,id)`: returns a *tortoise* object which uses `dom` as the *DOM* from the [*Atlas* toolkit](https://q37.info/s/c7hfkzvs), and the SVG element of id `id`,- `getAngle()`: returns the current angel, in degrees,- `up()`: puts the pen up,- `down()`: puts the pen down,- `setAutoDraw(value)`: the drawing is automatically rendered each `value` movements (`0` will disable the auto draw); call `draw()` to render remaining movements,- `setPosition(x,y)`: the turtle jumps to position `x` and `y`,- `forward(distance)`: the tortoise moves by the specified `distance`,- `right(angle)`: the tortoise turns clockwise from `angle` degrees,- `left(angle)`: the tortoise turns *counter* clockwise from `angle` degrees,- `setColorRGB(r,g,b)`: sets the color of the pen following the RGB color model,- `setColorHSL(h,s,l)`: sets the color of the pen following the HSL color model, (`h`: 0 - 360; `s`, `l`: 0 - 100%),- `draw()`: draws remaining movements,- `clear()`: erase the drawing area and also resets the internal settings (coordinates, angle, color…).</longdescription>

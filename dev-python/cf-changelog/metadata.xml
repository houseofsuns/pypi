	<longdescription># cf_changelog - Conflict-Free Changelog managerSimple tool to support changelog modifications on different git branches without conflicts on merging.Written in python, installable with pip.## Usage1. Install it from pip:```bashpip install cf_changelog```2. Create some changelog on different branches entries using:```bashcf_changelog add```It is required to run this from root of your repository.This will invoke standard text editor (or notepad/vim if standard editor is not configured), where you can fill a template with new features, bug fixes etc. Windows example:![Windows_example of editor with changelog entry](img/windows_template_screenshot.png)This is simple yaml format. You can use as many types of entries as you wish (New, Bugfix, Changed, Fixed, etc.). Each type should contain a flat list.The most important thing is that you don't have to remember anything specific related to this tool, just fill in a template.3. Commit newly created files.4. Repeat 2 and 3 on different branches as many times as you need.5. Merge all branches.6. On merged branch run:```bashcf_changelog release X.Y.Z```where X.Y.Z is description of version you want to see in final changelog.7. Commit registered changes in git repository (by default: Changelog.md and changelog directory).8. Enjoy your updated changelog.## How it works  - `add` command creates files with unique names by default in changelog/sources. Since file names are unique there will be no conflict on merge.  - `release` command parses those &quot;source&quot; files and adds them on the begining of Changelog.md. Then copies &quot;source&quot; files to &quot;archive&quot; just to keep them in history.Those commands calls `git add` on created and modified files to remind you that you have to commit them.## Project status  - Manual tests on Windows passed  - Manual tests on Ubuntu passed</longdescription>

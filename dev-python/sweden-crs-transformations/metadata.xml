	<longdescription># sweden_crs_transformations_4python'sweden_crs_transformations_4python' is a Python library ported from the[C#.NET library 'sweden_crs_transformations_4net'](https://github.com/TomasJohansson/sweden_crs_transformations_4net/) and it is used for transforming geographic coordinates between the following three kind of CRS (Coordinate Reference Systems):  WGS84, SWEREF99 and RT90.  (13 versions of SWEREF99, and 6 versions of RT90)# Code example```pythonfrom sweden_crs_transformations.crs_projection import CrsProjectionfrom sweden_crs_transformations.crs_coordinate import CrsCoordinatestockholmCentralStation_WGS84_latitude = 59.330231stockholmCentralStation_WGS84_longitude = 18.059196stockholmWGS84: CrsCoordinate = CrsCoordinate.create_coordinate(    CrsProjection.WGS84,    stockholmCentralStation_WGS84_latitude,    stockholmCentralStation_WGS84_longitude)stockholmSweref99tm: CrsCoordinate = stockholmWGS84.transform(CrsProjection.SWEREF_99_TM)print(f&quot;stockholmSweref99tm X: {stockholmSweref99tm.get_longitude_x()}&quot;)  # Python 3.6+print(f&quot;stockholmSweref99tm Y: {stockholmSweref99tm.get_latitude_y()}&quot;)print(f&quot;stockholmSweref99tm as string: {str(stockholmSweref99tm)}&quot;)'''Output from the above:stockholmSweref99tm X: 674032.357stockholmSweref99tm Y: 6580821.991stockholmSweref99tm as string: CrsCoordinate [ Y: 6580821.991 , X: 674032.357 , CRS: SWEREF_99_TM(EPSG:3006) ]'''all_projections = CrsProjection.get_all_crs_projections()for crs_projection in all_projections:    print(stockholmWGS84.transform(crs_projection))'''Output from the above loop:CrsCoordinate [ Latitude: 59.330231 , Longitude: 18.059196 , CRS: WGS84(EPSG:4326) ]CrsCoordinate [ Y: 6580821.991 , X: 674032.357 , CRS: SWEREF_99_TM(EPSG:3006) ]CrsCoordinate [ Y: 6595151.116 , X: 494604.69 , CRS: SWEREF_99_12_00(EPSG:3007) ]CrsCoordinate [ Y: 6588340.147 , X: 409396.217 , CRS: SWEREF_99_13_30(EPSG:3008) ]CrsCoordinate [ Y: 6583455.373 , X: 324101.998 , CRS: SWEREF_99_15_00(EPSG:3009) ]CrsCoordinate [ Y: 6580494.921 , X: 238750.424 , CRS: SWEREF_99_16_30(EPSG:3010) ]CrsCoordinate [ Y: 6579457.649 , X: 153369.673 , CRS: SWEREF_99_18_00(EPSG:3011) ]CrsCoordinate [ Y: 6585657.12 , X: 366758.045 , CRS: SWEREF_99_14_15(EPSG:3012) ]CrsCoordinate [ Y: 6581734.696 , X: 281431.616 , CRS: SWEREF_99_15_45(EPSG:3013) ]CrsCoordinate [ Y: 6579735.93 , X: 196061.94 , CRS: SWEREF_99_17_15(EPSG:3014) ]CrsCoordinate [ Y: 6579660.051 , X: 110677.129 , CRS: SWEREF_99_18_45(EPSG:3015) ]CrsCoordinate [ Y: 6581507.028 , X: 25305.238 , CRS: SWEREF_99_20_15(EPSG:3016) ]CrsCoordinate [ Y: 6585277.577 , X: -60025.629 , CRS: SWEREF_99_21_45(EPSG:3017) ]CrsCoordinate [ Y: 6590973.148 , X: -145287.219 , CRS: SWEREF_99_23_15(EPSG:3018) ]CrsCoordinate [ Y: 6598325.639 , X: 1884004.1 , CRS: RT90_7_5_GON_V(EPSG:3019) ]CrsCoordinate [ Y: 6587493.237 , X: 1756244.287 , CRS: RT90_5_0_GON_V(EPSG:3020) ]CrsCoordinate [ Y: 6580994.18 , X: 1628293.886 , CRS: RT90_2_5_GON_V(EPSG:3021) ]CrsCoordinate [ Y: 6578822.84 , X: 1500248.374 , CRS: RT90_0_0_GON_V(EPSG:3022) ]CrsCoordinate [ Y: 6580977.349 , X: 1372202.721 , CRS: RT90_2_5_GON_O(EPSG:3023) ]CrsCoordinate [ Y: 6587459.595 , X: 1244251.702 , CRS: RT90_5_0_GON_O(EPSG:3024) ]'''```# Accuracy of the transformationsThis Python library is a port of the [C#.NET library 'sweden_crs_transformations_4net'](https://github.com/TomasJohansson/sweden_crs_transformations_4net/) and therefore it is using the same file &quot;swedish_crs_coordinates.csv&quot; as the C# library, for the regression testing of the Python implementation.  There are 18 rows with coordinates in that file, and it will lead to 108 transformations being done when executing all Python tests, e.g. with the command 'py -3.9 -m unittest tests/coordinate_files/test_transforming_coordinates_from_file.py'.  The coordinate values in the file have been created as median values from six different Java implementations of CRS transformations.  For more information about the origin of the data file being used, please see the webpage linked above for the C# library 'sweden_crs_transformations_4net'.# Origin of the mathematics used in the libraryThis Python library is ported from the C#.NET library ('sweden_crs_transformations_4net') which is based on [C# library MightyLittleGeodesy](https://github.com/bjornsallarp/MightyLittleGeodesy/) which in turn is based on a [javascript library by Arnold Andreasson](https://latlong.mellifica.se/).  The main part of 'MightyLittleGeodesy' which has been kept (to the C# library 'sweden_crs_transformations_4net') is the mathematical calculations in the class 'GaussKreuger.cs'.  Regarding the port to this Python version 'sweden_crs_transformations_4python' then of course there had to be more modifications since Python has differences in syntax compared with C#, althoughthe mathematical logic has still been kept from the original 'MightyLittleGeodesy' class 'GaussKreuger.cs'.# LicenseMIT.'sweden_crs_transformations_4python' is ported from the C# library 'sweden_crs_transformations_4net'which is also licensed with MIT since it started as a fork of the C# library 'MightyLittleGeodesy' which is licensed with the MIT license.

	<longdescription># BitMEX Trio-Websocket[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/bitmex_trio_websocket.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bitmex-trio-websocket)[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/com/andersea/bitmex-trio-websocket.svg)](https://travis-ci.com/andersea/bitmex-trio-websocket)Websocket implementation for BitMEX cryptocurrency derivatives exchange.* Free software: MIT license## Features* Supports authenticated connections using api keys.* Uses SortedDict as backend storage for easy and fast table searching.* Fully async using async generators. No callbacks or event emitters.* Based on [Slurry](https://slurry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Slurry-websocket](https://github.com/andersea/slurry-websocket). ## InstallationThis library requires Python 3.7 or greater. To install from PyPI:    pip install bitmex-trio-websocket## Client example    import trio    from async_generator import aclosing    from bitmex_trio_websocket import open_bitmex_websocket    from trio_websocket import ConnectionClosed    async def main():        async with open_bitmex_websocket('testnet') as bws:            async with aclosing(bws.listen('instrument')) as agen:                try:                    async for msg in agen:                        print(f'Received message, symbol: \'{msg[&quot;symbol&quot;]}\', timestamp: \'{msg[&quot;timestamp&quot;]}\'')                except ConnectionClosed as e:                    print(e)    if __name__ == '__main__':        trio.run(main)This will print a sequence of dicts for each received item on inserts (including partials) or updates.Multiple tables can be listened to concurrently, by running each listener in a seperate task using nursery.start_soon.## API![async def](https://img.shields.io/badge/async%20with-open__bitmex__websocket(network%2C%20api__key%2C%20api__secret%2C%20*%2C%20dead_mans_switch)-blue)Creates a new websocket object.This is an async context manager, so it needs to be used with the `async with .. as ..:` construct. The returned value is a BitMEXWebsocket object.**`network`** strNetwork to connect to. Options: 'mainnet', 'testnet'.**`api_key`** Optional\[str\]Api key for authenticated connections. **`api_secret`** Optional\[str\]Api secret for authenticated connections.**`dead_mans_switch`** Optional\[bool\]When enabled, the websocket will periodically send cancelAllAfter messages with a timeout of 60 seconds. The timer is refreshed every 15 seconds.See: https://www.bitmex.com/app/wsAPI#Dead-Mans-Switch-Auto-Cancel![bitmex__trio__websocket.BitMEXWebsocket](https://img.shields.io/badge/class-bitmex__trio__websocket.BitMEXWebsocket-blue?style=flat-square)![await listen](https://img.shields.io/badge/await-listen(table,%20symbol=None)-green)Subscribes to the channel and optionally a specific symbol. It is possible for multiple listenersto be listening using the same subscription.Returns an async generator object that yields messages from the channel.If the websocket is closed, while a listener is still active, a [trio-websocket.ConnectionClosed](https://trio-websocket.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#trio_websocket.ConnectionClosed) error will be raised by the generator, with the reason for the closure.**`table`** strChannel to subscribe to.**`symbol`** Optional[str]Optional symbol to subscribe to.![storage](https://img.shields.io/badge/attribute-storage-teal)This attribute contains the storage object for the websocket. The storage object caches the data tables for receiveditems. The implementation uses SortedDict from [Sorted Containers](http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/sortedcontainers/index.html),to handle inserts, updates and deletes.The storage object has two public attributes `data`, and `keys`.`data` contains the table state for each channel as a dictionary with the table name as key. The tables are sorted dictionaries, stored with key tuples generated from each item using the keys schema received in the initial partial message.`data['orderBookL2']` is a special state dictionary for the orderBookL2 table. It is a double nested defaultdict, with a SortedDict containing each price level. The nested dictionaries are composed like this:    # Special storage for orderBookL2    # dict[symbol][side][id]    self.data['orderBookL2'] = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(SortedDict))`keys` contains a mapping for lists of keys by which to look up values in each table.In addition the following helper methods are supplied:`make_key(table, match_data)` creates a key for searching the `data` table. Raises `ValueError` if `table == 'orderBookL2'`, since this table needs special indexing.`parse_timestamp(timestamp)` static method for converting BitMEX timestamps to datetime with timezone (UTC).## CreditsThanks to the [Trio](https://github.com/python-trio/trio) and [Trio-websocket](https://github.com/HyperionGray/trio-websocket) libraries for their awesome work.The library was originally based on the [reference client](https://github.com/BitMEX/api-connectors/tree/master/official-ws), but is now substantially redesigned.This package was created with [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) and the [audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage) project template.</longdescription>

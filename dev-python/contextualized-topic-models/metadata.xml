We are not limitedby the BoW anymore.We also have `Kitty &lt;https://contextualized-topic-models.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kitty.html&gt;`_!

CombinedTM and ZeroShotTM, which have different use cases.+ CTMs work better when the size of the bag of words **has been restricted to a number of terms** that does not go over **2000 elements**. This is because we have a neural model that reconstructs the input bag of word, Moreover, in CombinedTM we project the contextualized embedding to the vocab space, the bigger the vocab the more parameters you get, with the training being more difficult and prone to bad fitting. This is **NOT** a strict limit, however, consider preprocessing your dataset. We have a preprocessing_ pipeline that can help you in dealing with this.+ Check the contextual model you are using, the **multilingual model one used on English data might not give results that are as good** as the pure English trained one.+ **Preprocessing is key**. If you give a contextual model like BERT preprocessed text, it might be difficult to get out a good representation. What we usually do is use the preprocessed text for the bag of word creating and use the NOT preprocessed text for BERT embeddings. Our preprocessing_ class can take care of this for you.+ CTM uses `SBERT`_, you should check it out to better understand how we create embeddings. SBERT allows us to use any embedding model. You might want to check things like `max length &lt;https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/computing-embeddings/README.html#input-sequence-length&gt;`_.Installing~~~~~~~~~~**Important**: If you want to use CUDA you need to install the correct version ofthe CUDA systems that matches your distribution, see pytorch_.Install the package using pip.. code-block:: bash    pip install -U contextualized_topic_modelsModels~~~~~~An important aspect to take into account is which network you want to use:the one that combines contextualized embeddingsand the BoW (`CombinedTM &lt;https://contextualized-topic-models.readthedocs.io/en/latest/combined.html&gt;`_) or the one that just uses contextualized embeddings (`ZeroShotTM &lt;https://contextualized-topic-models.readthedocs.io/en/latest/zeroshot.html&gt;`_)But remember that you can do zero-shot cross-lingual topic modeling only with the `ZeroShotTM &lt;https://contextualized-topic-models.readthedocs.io/en/latest/zeroshot.html&gt;`_ model.Contextualized Topic Models also support supervision (SuperCTM). You can read more about this on the `documentation &lt;https://contextualized-topic-models.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html&gt;`_... image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MilaNLProc/contextualized-topic-models/master/img/ctm_both.jpeg   :align: center   :width: 800pxWe also have `Kitty &lt;https://contextualized-topic-models.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kitty.html&gt;`_: a utility you can use to do a simpler human in the loop classification of yourdocuments. This can be very useful to do document filtering. It also works in cross-lingual setting andthus you might be able to filter documents in a language you don't know!References----------If you find this useful you can cite the following papers :)**ZeroShotTM**::    @inproceedings{bianchi-etal-2021-cross,        title = &quot;Cross-lingual Contextualized Topic Models with Zero-shot Learning&quot;,        author = &quot;Bianchi, Federico and Terragni, Silvia and Hovy, Dirk  and          Nozza, Debora and Fersini, Elisabetta&quot;,        booktitle = &quot;Proceedings of the 16th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Main Volume&quot;,        month = apr,        year = &quot;2021&quot;,        address = &quot;Online&quot;,        publisher = &quot;Association for Computational Linguistics&quot;,        url = &quot;https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2021.eacl-main.143&quot;,        pages = &quot;1676--1683&quot;,    }**CombinedTM**::    @inproceedings{bianchi-etal-2021-pre,        title = &quot;Pre-training is a Hot Topic: Contextualized Document Embeddings Improve Topic Coherence&quot;,        author = &quot;Bianchi, Federico  and          Terragni, Silvia  and          Hovy, Dirk&quot;,        booktitle = &quot;Proceedings of the 59th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 11th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 2: Short Papers)&quot;,        month = aug,        year = &quot;2021&quot;,        address = &quot;Online&quot;,        publisher = &quot;Association for Computational Linguistics&quot;,        url = &quot;https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-short.96&quot;,        doi = &quot;10.18653/v1/2021.acl-short.96&quot;,        pages = &quot;759--766&quot;,    }Language-Specific and Multilingual----------------------------------Some of the examples below use a multilingual embedding model:code:`paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2`.This means that the representations you are going to use are mutlilingual.However you might need a broader coverage of languages or just one specific language.Refer to the page in the documentation to see how to choose a model for another language.In that case, you can check `SBERT`_ to find the perfect model to use.Here, you can read more about `language-specific and mulitlingual &lt;https://contextualized-topic-models.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html&gt;`_.Quick Overview--------------You should definitely take a look at the `documentation &lt;https://contextualized-topic-models.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html&gt;`_to better understand how these topic models work.Combined Topic Model~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Here is how you can use the CombinedTM. This is a standard topic model that also uses contextualized embeddings. The good thing about CombinedTM is that it makes your topic much more coherent (see the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03974).n_components=50 specifies the number of topics... code-block:: python    from contextualized_topic_models.models.ctm import CombinedTM    from contextualized_topic_models.utils.data_preparation import TopicModelDataPreparation    from contextualized_topic_models.utils.data_preparation import bert_embeddings_from_file    qt = TopicModelDataPreparation(&quot;all-mpnet-base-v2&quot;)    training_dataset = qt.fit(text_for_contextual=list_of_unpreprocessed_documents, text_for_bow=list_of_preprocessed_documents)    ctm = CombinedTM(bow_size=len(qt.vocab), contextual_size=768, n_components=50) # 50 topics    ctm.fit(training_dataset) # run the model    ctm.get_topics(2)**Advanced Notes:** Combined TM combines the BoW with SBERT, a process that seems to increasethe coherence of the predicted topics (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.03974.pdf).Zero-Shot Topic Model~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Our ZeroShotTM can be used for zero-shot topic modeling. It can handle words that are not used during the training phase.More interestingly, this model can be used for cross-lingual topic modeling (See next sections)! See the paper (https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2021.eacl-main.143).. code-block:: python    from contextualized_topic_models.models.ctm import ZeroShotTM    from contextualized_topic_models.utils.data_preparation import TopicModelDataPreparation    from contextualized_topic_models.utils.data_preparation import bert_embeddings_from_file    text_for_contextual = [        &quot;hello, this is unpreprocessed text you can give to the model&quot;,        &quot;have fun with our topic model&quot;,    ]    text_for_bow = [        &quot;hello unpreprocessed give model&quot;,        &quot;fun topic model&quot;,    ]    qt = TopicModelDataPreparation(&quot;paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2&quot;)    training_dataset = qt.fit(text_for_contextual=text_for_contextual, text_for_bow=text_for_bow)    ctm = ZeroShotTM(bow_size=len(qt.vocab), contextual_size=768, n_components=50)    ctm.fit(training_dataset) # run the model    ctm.get_topics(2)As you can see, the high-level API to handle the text is pretty easy to use;**text_for_bert** should be used to pass to the model a list of documents that are not preprocessed.Instead, to **text_for_bow** you should pass the preprocessed text used to build the BoW.**Advanced Notes:** in this way, SBERT can use all the information in the text to generate the representations.Using The Topic Models----------------------Getting The Topics~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Once the model is trained, it is very easy to get the topics!.. code-block:: python    ctm.get_topics()Predicting Topics For Unseen Documents~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The **transform** method will take care of most things for you, for example the generationof a corresponding BoW by considering only the words that the model has seen in training.However, this comes with some bumps when dealing with the ZeroShotTM, as we will se in the next section.You can, however, manually load the embeddings if you like (see the Advanced part of this documentation).Mono-Lingual Topic Modeling===========================If you use **CombinedTM** you need to include the test text for the BOW:.. code-block:: python    testing_dataset = qt.transform(text_for_contextual=testing_text_for_contextual, text_for_bow=testing_text_for_bow)    # n_sample how many times to sample the distribution (see the doc)    ctm.get_doc_topic_distribution(testing_dataset, n_samples=20) # returns a (n_documents, n_topics) matrix with the topic distribution of each documentIf you use **ZeroShotTM** you do not need to use the `testing_text_for_bow` because if you are usinga different set of test documents, this will create a BoW of a different size. Thus, the bestway to do this is to pass just the text that is going to be given in input to the contexual model:.. code-block:: python    testing_dataset = qt.transform(text_for_contextual=testing_text_for_contextual)    # n_sample how many times to sample the distribution (see the doc)    ctm.get_doc_topic_distribution(testing_dataset, n_samples=20)Cross-Lingual Topic Modeling============================Once you have trained the ZeroShotTM model with multilingual embeddings,you can use this simple pipeline to predict the topics for documents in a different language (as long as this languageis covered by **paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2**)... code-block:: python    # here we have a Spanish document    testing_text_for_contextual = [        &quot;hola, bienvenido&quot;,    ]    # since we are doing multilingual topic modeling, we do not need the BoW in    # ZeroShotTM when doing cross-lingual experiments (it does not make sense, since we trained with an english Bow    # to use the spanish BoW)    testing_dataset = qt.transform(testing_text_for_contextual)    # n_sample how many times to sample the distribution (see the doc)    ctm.get_doc_topic_distribution(testing_dataset, n_samples=20) # returns a (n_documents, n_topics) matrix with the topic distribution of each document**Advanced Notes:** We do not need to pass the Spanish bag of word: the bag of words of the two languages will not be comparable! We are passing it to the model for compatibility reasons, but you cannot getthe output of the model (i.e., the predicted BoW of the trained language) and compare it with the testing language one.More Advanced Stuff-------------------Preprocessing~~~~~~~~~~~~~Do you need a quick script to run the preprocessing pipeline? We got you covered! Load your documentsand then use our SimplePreprocessing class. It will automatically filter infrequent words and remove documentsthat are empty after training. The preprocess method will return the preprocessed and the unpreprocessed documents.We generally use the unpreprocessed for BERT and the preprocessed for the Bag Of Word... code-block:: python    from contextualized_topic_models.utils.preprocessing import WhiteSpacePreprocessing    documents = [line.strip() for line in open(&quot;unpreprocessed_documents.txt&quot;).readlines()]    sp = WhiteSpacePreprocessing(documents, &quot;english&quot;)    preprocessed_documents, unpreprocessed_corpus, vocab, retained_indices = sp.preprocess()Using Custom Embeddings with Kitty~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Do you have custom embeddings and want to use them for faster results? Just give them to Kitty!.. code-block:: python    from contextualized_topic_models.models.kitty_classifier import Kitty    import numpy as np    # read the training data    training_data = list(map(lambda x : x.strip(), open(&quot;train_data&quot;).readlines()))    custom_embeddings = np.load('custom_embeddings.npy')    kt = Kitty()    kt.train(training_data, custom_embeddings=custom_embeddings, stopwords_list=[&quot;stopwords&quot;])    print(kt.pretty_print_word_classes())Note: Custom embeddings must be numpy.arrays.Development Team----------------* `Federico Bianchi`_ &lt;f.bianchi@unibocconi.it&gt; Bocconi University* `Silvia Terragni`_ &lt;s.terragni4@campus.unimib.it&gt; University of Milan-Bicocca* `Dirk Hovy`_ &lt;dirk.hovy@unibocconi.it&gt; Bocconi UniversitySoftware Details----------------* Free software: MIT license* Documentation: https://contextualized-topic-models.readthedocs.io.* Super big shout-out to `Stephen Carrow`_ for creating the awesome https://github.com/estebandito22/PyTorchAVITM package from which we constructed the foundations of this package.

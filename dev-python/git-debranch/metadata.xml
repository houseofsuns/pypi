	<longdescription># git-debranchGit subcommand that uses [SpiffWorkflow](https://github.com/sartography/SpiffWorkflow) to remove branches that are no longer needed.## Installation```pip install git-debranch```## Running```git debranch```From inside a git repository, running `git debranch` will present you with a list of branches that could be deleted. This list is presented using `$EDITOR`. If the environment variable is not set `vi` is used as the fallback.*Please note `git fetch -p` is run before the branch list is presented. This can be disabled by providingthe --offline switch.*## Usage```usage: git debranch [-h] [--offline] [--dry-run]Delete local git branchesoptions:  -h          show this help message and exit  --offline   Do not run online operations such as fetch and prune  --dry-run   Do not actually delete branches```## Editing the Branch ListWhen `$EDITOR` is invoked, it will contain a series of lines. Comment lines begin with `#` and any line that is not empty or a comment is assumed to be the name of a branch to delete locally. You can update this list by either removing or commenting branches that you want to keep. Branches that appear safe to delete are uncommented by default. Branches that may not be safe to delete are left commented by default. When you save and close `$EDITOR` any uncommented branches will be deleted using `git branch -D`.## DevelopingIn my opinion this project turned out to be quite pleasurable to work with. Please feel free to play with the code. `TODO.md` has some loose TODO items that may turn into issues at some point.### Development Installation```pip install -r dev_requirements.txt```You likely want to be inside a venv. This wlll give you an editable installation so you can run the program and see changes. If you add a new bpmn/json file then you need to re-run this command.### Using SpiffArena for BPMN edits[SpiffArena](https://github.com/sartography/spiff-arena) is used to make edits to the BPMN files that are bundled with this program. To start the editor run `make run-editor`. You will be presented with a messageonce started to go to `http://localhost:8001` (assuming the default configuration is used). The editorrequires `docker` and `docker compose` to run.From there you can edit the diagrams but you cannot run them from within SpiffArena at this time. Some work would need to be done to support our custom `Connector Proxy` that is not http based. You can however run the `Script Task` unit tests, which were very helpful during development.When finished you can `make stop-editor`. If you would like to pull the latest version of SpiffArena use`make update-editor`.</longdescription>

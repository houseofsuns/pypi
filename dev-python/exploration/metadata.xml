	<longdescription># Exploration## OverviewThis program provides data types for representing the exploration ofspaces that can defined (or abstracted) in terms of discrete decisions,such as videogame levels with multiple rooms and also other things likeconversation trees or a city block grid.It represents space using a `DecisionGraph`, which is a multi-di-graphindicating the transition(s) between decisions, which can includeinformation about prerequisites for transitions as well as effects atransition might have on the world. There is also a convention forrepresenting unexplored regions using specially-tagged nodes of thegraph. An `Exploration` is a sequence of `DecisionGraph`s, along with asequence of decisions indicating where the explorer was at each step, asequence of transitions indicating which transition was taken at eachstep, and a sequence of states indicating extra state at each step. Theserepresentations were developed with Metroidvania games in mind.Core capabilities include:- Representing exploration processes as a series of decisions including    partial information about not-yet-explored decisions.- Creating maps and explorations from various text formats, including    exploration journal formats.- Reasoning about reachability modulo transition requirements in terms of    powers that must be possessed and/or tokens that must be spent for a    transition. TODO- The ability to represent fairly sophisticated game logic in the    `DecisionGraph`, and even construct playable maps. Game logic that    can't be captured this way can still be represented through making    custom changes to maps between exploration steps. TODO## Dependencies:- Python version 3.8+- `networkx` For underlying graph structures.- `pytest` for testing, install with `[test]` option to get it automatically.## InstallingJust run `pip install exploration`. The `egtool` script should beinstalled along with the module.You can then run `python -m exploration.tests` to run tests.## Getting Started:The `egtool` script provides a command-line interface to corefunctionality. The `exploration.main` module provides equivalent entrypoints from Python. `exploration.core` provides the main types andexplains how they fit together.## Plans- Better support for open-world games, where decisions are not as closely    linked to virtual space structure.## Changelog- v0.6.1 fixes egtool.py script to include new optional command-line args    instead of mandatory args.- v0.6.0 adds Graphviz Dot format support (both import and export) and    fixes up some bugs with the JSON import/export. Also changes tags so    that they have values instead of just being part of a set. Analysis    tools have expanded a bit and a system of metafunctions for    automatically applying smallest-unit analysis tools to larger units    has been added so we don't have to re-write &quot;apply this to each    situation&quot; a bunch of times. Analysis tools are set up to run every    tool on a file and write results to a CSV file (see `main.py` for    analysis tool configuration). The `egtool.py` script now accepts    command-line options but falls back to interactive prompting.    Finally finished describeProgress and overhauled analysis tests so    that we don't have any xfails right now. Adds 'extinguish' and    'complicate' journal entry types to better support mistaken    impressions.- v0.5.1 reorganizes some testing code out of the import-module run path.- v0.5 includes a few bugfixes over 0.4, and most notably a stable syntax    for entering relative mode at the current location, as well as an 'F'    entry type for &quot;fulfills&quot; to note power equivalence. It also    introduces the first real analysis tool, which just counts the number    of unexplored options at each step of the graph.- v0.4 introduces the 'actionPart' target type so that you can do 'oa' to    observe an action without taking it. It also introduces long-form    entry types and targets: you can just write out the full name of an    entry type, possibly followed by an @ and either a full or    abbreviated target type. Hopefully this helps make things more    accessible for beginners. There are also now a few built-in debug    commands available for printing relvant stuff. More may be added as    they become popular. It also introduces equivalences, stored in the    `DecisionGraph`, which allow powers (but not tokens) to count as    being obtained when one of a set of other requirements is met    instead. The 'fulfills' journal entry can add these.- v0.3 is a pretty big overhaul. Changes journal format a bit (zones are    now easier to deal with). Adds command-line interface (`__main__.py`    via API in `main.py`). Adds interactive script `egtool`. Adds JSON    serialization and `__eq__` methods for `DecisionGraph` and    `Exploration` types. Fills out 'edit' effect type with a new    `Command` syntax which is it's own tiny DSL for editing    graphs/explorations. Also adds aliases in the journal format so that    it's easier to store/recall complex but repeated patterns. Extends    testing code quite a bit and fixes a fair number of bugs found via    those tests, although coverage is still incomplete. This version    pushes module compatibility up to 3.10 since the type checking code    is to tightly intertwined with the actual runtime code in places to    be easily separable and it uses 3.10 features. One final big change:    the default journal format has changed so that 'g' is for tag, 't'    (which used to be tag) is for 'retrace', and 'r' (which used to be    retrace) is for 'return'). 'R' is no longer used by the default    format. Note that until 1.0, there may continue to be some    instability in the default journal format.- v0.2 Journal functionality (`journal.py`) is working at a basic level,    with a few things still to-do (e.g., edit effects). Design has    changed since previous versions. The zone system now works, although    needs more testing. Design will be iterated on so the API and    particularly the journal format is not 100% stable yet. Changed    version support from 3.7+ to 3.8+ because of needing typing.Literal.- v0.1.2 Core functionality (`core.py`) is working &amp; tested, with the    exception of the zones system. Journals are not working, and tests    for those have been disabled for now. Could be used for    representation purposes, but is not yet complete. This version is    effectively the first alpha release since I'm demoing at the PCG    workshop. Note most of the 'core capabilities' are still TODO.- v0.1.1 Still pre-alpha as it's in the process of being re-architected a    bit, but some core functionality is present if rough (e.g.,    `core.DecisionGraph` and `core.Exploration`).- v0.1 Initial pre-alpha upload.</longdescription>

	<longdescription># Quantile Data Kit 🔍## Publish to pypiHow to deploy a new version of the QDK?1) Update the package version in `setup.py`.2) Run the Makefile `make publish`## ComponentsThere are four types of base components in the QDK. 1) `LoadComponent`. Takes nothing as input and outputs a DataFrame.2) `TransformComponent`. Takes a DataFrame as input and outputs a DataFrame.3) `TrainingComponent`. Takes data and a model as input and outputs a trained model.4) `InferenceComponent`. Takes data and a model as input and ouputs prediction data.## Adding a new component?Adding a new component to the QDK requires the following steps:1) **Type of component:** Decide which type of the four components above you are adding. 2) **Add component:** Once you decide which type of component you are adding, add in the corresponding folder (e.g. `qdk/loader`) a new Python file that inherits from the parent component. In this file you can optionally overwrite `input_defs`, `output_defs` and `config_schema`. When adding a new component, you are required to add a classmethod with the same name as the `compute_function` attribute on the parent class. The keys in the `config_schema` are injected into the parameters of the compute function. Lastly, you need to import the new component to `qdk/__init__.py`. This allows you to import it from top-level.4) **Write tests**: To continuously check the robustness of the components, we highly encourage you to add tests using `pytest`. The tests can be added at `qdk/tests`. Reminder to prefix the folder, files and functions with `test_`. One is able to test the components using either VScode testing or the terminal (e.g. with `pytest -s qdk/tests/test_loaders`).</longdescription>

	<longdescription># CDISC / Transcelerate DDF USDM PackageThis package provides an implementation of the Digital Data Flow (DDF) CDISC / TransCelerate Unified Study Definitions Model (USDM). Two main parts are provided:- Within the `usdm_model` directory are a set of classes reflecting the USDM model as transported using the DDF USDM API - Within the `usdm_excel` directory is a class, `USDMExcel`, that can be used to import an entire study definition from an excel file and build the equivalent json as defined by the API# WarningThis package was, originally, not intended for public use and, consequently, only informal testing has been performed on the package to date. Formal testing has just begun. Use this at your own risk.# SetupSetup is via pip`pip install usdm`The package requires a single environment variable `CDISC_API_KEY` that should be set to your CDISC library API key. This is used to access CDISC CT and BC definitions in the CDISC library.See below for a simple example program.# USDM ModelNot further information as yet.# Excel Import## Example ProgramThe following code imports an Excel file (in the appropriate structure) and processes it. The data are then exported to a file in JSON API format. *Note: The logging is not needed.*```import logginglog = logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)import jsonfrom usdm_excel import USDMExcelexcel = USDMExcel(&quot;source_data/simple_1.xlsx&quot;)with open('source_data/simple_1.json', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:  f.write(json.dumps(json.loads(excel.to_json()), indent=2))```## Format of Workbook### General#### SheetsThe workbook consists of several sheets each with a dedicated purpose. All sheets must be present.- Study sheet- Study Identifiers sheet- Study Design sheet- one or more Timeline sheets- Study Design Indications and Interventions sheet- Study Design Populations sheet- Study Design Objectives and Endpoints sheet- Study Design Estimands sheet- Study Design Procedures sheet- Study Design Encounters sheet- Study Design Elements sheet- Configuration sheetThe content of each sheet is described below. Example workbooks can be found in the [CDISC Reference Architecture repo](https://github.com/cdisc-org/DDF-RA/tree/sprint-11/Deliverables/IG/examples). *Note: the link above points to the sprint 11 branch. This will be merged into the main branch prior to public review.*#### CDISC TerminologyFor those cells where CDISC codes are used the user can enter either the CDISC C Code, for example `C15602`, the CDISC submission value, for example `PHASE III TRIAL`, or the preferred term, for example `Phase III Trial`#### External TerminologyFor those cells where external CT is referenced the user can enter code in the form `&lt;code system&gt;: &lt;code&gt; = &lt;decode&gt;`. For example `SPONSOR: A = decode 1, SPONSOR: B = decode 2`.### Identifiers and Cross ReferencesSome content defined within the sheets contain unique identifiers such that the content can be cross referenced in other sheets. This is done so as to link content or expand definitions. Identifiers are simple strings that need to be unique within the workbook. There is a single definition and one or more cross references.### Study Sheet#### Sheet Name`study`#### Sheet ContentsThe study sheet consists of two parts, the upper section for those single values and then a section for the potentially repeating protocol version informaionFor the single values, the keyword is in column A while the value is in column B.

Each epoch name should have a corresponding entry in the Study Design Epochs sheet, see below.The arm rows consist of the arm name in the first column followed by a cells for each epoch containing one or more references to study design elements defined in the studyDesignElements sheet.

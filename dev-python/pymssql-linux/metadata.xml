UsingMS drivers on SQL Server 2005 requires version 11.0 or earlierof the MS driver, which is nearly impossible to compile on amodern \*nix system due to an entire butterfly network ofdependencies on long-deprecated system libraries. If you've evertried to compile something non-trivial on Linux during themid-90s, you'll know the pain of which I speak.Why Not Support Windows?------------------------See above. If Microsoft never honored us by gifting us a bunchof deprecated code that hadn't been maintained for a decade,the upstream pymssql would have been the only game in town andwould have happily chugged along. But Microsoft did honor us,which led to the behind-the-courthouse death of pymssql, whichled to the earthly hell of trying to compile Microsoft-gathered\*nix code that relied on libraries from the early 2000s, etcetera, ad infinitum.I have zero interest in figuring out how to build pymssql ina Windows CI. If someone wants to work with me to portpymssql to the Commodore 64, the Amiga 500, or Windows 2.1,let us waste no time. But forget Windows &gt;= 3.1.It must be childishly easy to get the official drivers workingon a Windows box anyways.Build Instructions------------------One of the reasons the upstream repository became such a tangleof inconsistent and outdated information is that it containeda large amount of build-related cruft that accumulated overthe years. And that cruft was in addition to a README thatcontained build instructions that *maybe* worked two versionsago.To avoid this fate, this repository will maintain only thoseCI configs that are being used to build, test, and deploythis package to PyPi. Currently, that universe consists ofone CI, *circleci*, chosen only because it was the repository ofthe most valid build instructions at the time this repowas forked from upstream. This may change in the future.Though this README may provide some additional context,the only set of build instructions that are guaranteedto be valid will be contained in the config file(s) forthe current CI system being used. For the branch to whichthis README document pertains, the CI system is circleciand the build instructions are at `.circleci/config.yml`Though referencing a CI configuration file is not asuser-friendly as writing a soliloquy, it has the benefitof being verifiably accurate. If the circleci status badgeat the top of this README indicates that the last buildsucceeded, then the circleci build instructions are valid.Tests-----The testing suite has been inherited from upstream. Whileit shows as passing in circleci, it actually fails withmultiple errors, and the successful result in circleciappears to be the result of the tests being passed intocircleci as shell scripts, whose error-ful exit codesare not being passed to circleci.Bringing this project under test will be left to a futuremaintainer, hopefully a future maintainer of the upstreampackage. This maintainer tested the resulting packagesin the maintainer's use case, and the packages have passed.Yes, that is anecdotal.Since the tests do not work, they have been disabled in`.circleci/config.yml`.The remainder of this document is from the upstreamrepository and is likely outdated, especially as it pertainsto build instructions. As my kinsfolk say, *szerokiej drogi*.Original Pymssql Readme=======================To build pymssql-linux, you should have:* python &gt;= 3.7 including development files.* Cython &gt;= 0.29* FreeTDS &gt;= 0.95 including development files. Research your  OS-specific distribution channels. (Archlinux: freetds,  Debian: freetds-common, freetds-dev)* gccTo build, simply run `python setup.py build` in the projectroot directory.It is possible to build a binary wheel package of pymssql-linuxthat pulls in and compiles a known-working version of FreeTDS.This option may become necessary if FreeTDS code evolves in away that breaks compatibility with pymssql-linux, the developmentof which is, after all, frozen. Follow the binary wheel buildinstructions below in this case.Details about the discontinuation of the original projectand a discussion of alternatives to pymssql can be foundat: https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/issues/668This fork is being maintained because pymssql works witholder SQL Server versions that use deprecated TLS versions1.0 and 1.1. Alternatives that utilize Microsoft's nativeSQL driver require the installation of version 11.0 of thedriver, which is difficult to achieve cleanly due tomultiple dependencies on deprecated library versions.pymssql - DB-API interface to Microsoft SQL Server==================================================A simple database interface for `Python`_ that builds on top of `FreeTDS`_ toprovide a Python DB-API (`PEP-249`_) interface to `Microsoft SQL Server`_... _Microsoft SQL Server: http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/.. _Python: http://www.python.org/.. _PEP-249: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/.. _FreeTDS: http://www.freetds.org/There is a Google Group for discussion at:https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/pymssqlBuilding Binary Wheels======================To build manylinux Python wheels, ensure you have docker and docker-composeinstalled, and run the following in the project root directory:.. code-block:: bash    docker-compose up -d    docker exec pymssql-linux_x86_x64_1 ./io/dev/build_manylinux_wheels.sh    docker exec pymssql-linux_i686_1 ./io/dev/build_manylinux_wheels.sh    docker-compose downTo run unit tests, run the following before bringing the containers down:.. code-block:: bash    docker exec pymssql-linux_x86_x64_1 ./io/dev/test_manylinux_wheels.sh    docker exec pymssql-linux_i686_1 ./io/dev/test_manylinux_wheels.shIf the build suceeds, the `dist` directory in the project root willcontain .whl files for Python versions &gt;= 3.7. These can be installedby running `pip install &lt;filename.whl&gt;`... default-role:: codeRecent Changes==============Version 2.1.6 - 2020-06-05 (pymssql-linux)=================================================- Fix circleci build script- Update docker-compose.yml to manylinux2010 images- Prepare package for upload to PyPi as pymssql-linuxVersion 2.1.5 - 2019-11-27 (pymssql-linux)=================================================- Add Python 3.8 support.- Drop support for Python &lt; 3.6Version 3.0.3 - 2019-11-15==================================Fix messages that say &quot;pymssql&lt;=3.0&quot; should be just &quot;&lt;'.  Thanks Eric Moyer for reporting.Versions 3.0.1 &amp; 3.0.2 were released for the same reason, but with various readme typos that pypinow requires a new version release to fix.Version 3.0 - 2019-11-15==============================Release &quot;stub&quot; version that errors during install to notify of project's discontinuation.To install the last working released version, install with a version specifier like &quot;pymmsql&lt;3.0&quot;.E.g. `pip install &quot;pymssql&lt;3.0&quot;`For details and alternatives, see: https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/issues/668Version 2.1.4 - 2018-08-28==============================General-------- Drop support for versions of FreeTDS older than 0.91.- Add Python 3.7 support- Drop Python 3.3 supportFeatures--------- Support for new in SQL Server 2008 ``DATE``, ``TIME`` and ``DATETIME2`` data  types (GH-156). The following conditions need to be additionally met so  values of these column types can be returned from the database as their  native corresponding Python data types instead of as strings:  * Underlying FreeTDS must be 0.95 or newer.  * TDS protocol version in use must be 7.3 or newer.  Thanks Ed Avis for the implementation. (GH-331)Bug fixes---------- Fix ``tds_version``  ``_mssql`` connection property value for TDS version.  7.1 is actually 7.1 and not 8.0.Version 2.1.3 - 2016-06-22 - Ramiro Morales===========================================- We now publish Linux PEP 513 manylinux wheels on PyPI.- Windows official binaries: Rollback changes to Windows binaries we had  implemented in pymssql 2.1.2; go back to using:  * A statically linked version of FreeTDS (v0.95.95)  * No SSL supportVersion 2.1.2 - 2016-02-10 - Ramiro Morales===========================================.. attention:: Windows users: You need to download and install additional DLLs    pymssql version 2.1.2 includes a change in the official Windows binaries:    FreeTDS isn't statically linked as it happened up to release 2.1.1, as that    FreeTDS copy lacked SSL support.    Please see http://pymssql.org/en/latest/freetds.html#windows for futher    details.    We are trying to find a balance between security and convenience and will    be evaluating the situation for future releases. Your feedback is greatly    welcome.Features--------- Add ability to set TDS protocol version from pymssql when connecting to SQL  Server. For the remaining pymssql 2.1.x releases its default value will be 7.1  (GH-323)- Add Dockerfile and a Docker image and instructions on how to use it (GH-258).  This could be a convenient way to use pymssql without having to build stuff.  See http://pymssql.readthedocs.org/en/latest/intro.html#docker  Thanks Marc Abramowitz.- Floating point values are now accepted as Stored Procedure arguments  (GH-287). Thanks Runzhou Li (Leo) for the report and Bill Adams for the  implementation.- Send pymssql version in the appname TDS protocol login record field when the  application doesn't provide one (GH-354)Bug fixes---------- Fix a couple of very common causes of segmentation faults in presence of  network a partition between a pymssql-based app and SQL Server (GH-147,  GH-271) Thanks Marc Abramowitz. See also GH-373.- Fix failures and inconsistencies in query parameter interpolation when  UTF-8-encoded literals are present (GH-185). Thanks Bill Adams. Also, GH-291.- Fix ``login_timeout`` parameter of ``pymssql.connect()`` (GH-318)- Fixed some cases of ``cursor.rowcont`` having a -1 value after iterating  over the value returned by pymssql cursor ``fetchmany()`` and ``fetchone()``  methods (GH-141)- Remove automatic treatment of string literals passed in queries that start  with ``'0x'`` as hexadecimal values (GH-286)- Fix build fatal error when using Cython &gt;= 0.22 (GH-311)Internals---------- Add Appveyor hosted CI setup for running tests on Windows (GH-347)- Travis CI: Use newer, faster, container-based infrastructure. Also, test  against more than one FreeTDS version.- Make it possible to build official release files (sdist, wheels) on Travis &amp;  AppVeyor.Version 2.1.1 - 2014-11-25 - Ramiro Morales===========================================Features--------- Custom message handlers (GH-139)  The DB-Library API includes a callback mechanism so applications can provide  functions known as *message handlers* that get passed informative messages  sent by the server which then can be logged, shown to the user, etc.  ``_mssql`` now allows you to install your own *message handlers* written in  Python. See the ``_msssql`` examples and reference sections of the  documentation for more details.  Thanks Marc Abramowitz.- Compatibility with Azure  It is now possible to transparently connect to `SQL Server instances`_  accessible as part of the Azure_ cloud services.  .. note:: If you need to connect to Azure make sure you use FreeTDS 0.91 or            newer.- Customizable per-connection initialization SQL clauses (both in ``pymssql``  and ``_mssql``) (GH-97)  It is now possible to customize the SQL statements sent right after the  connection is established (e.g. ``'SET ANSI_NULLS ON;'``). Previously  it was a hard-coded list of queries. See the ``_mssql.MSSQLConnection``  documentation for more details.  Thanks Marc Abramowitz.- Added ability to handle instances of ``uuid.UUID`` passed as parameters for  SQL queries both in ``pymssql`` and ``_mssql``. (GH-209)  Thanks Marat Mavlyutov.- Allow using `SQL Server autocommit mode`_ from ``pymssql`` at connection  opening time. This allows e.g. DDL statements like ``DROP DATABASE`` to be  executed. (GH-210)  Thanks Marat Mavlyutov.- Documentation: Explicitly mention minimum versions supported of Python (2.6)  and SQL Server (2005).- Incremental enhancements to the documentation... _SQL Server instances: http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/services/sql-database/.. _Azure: https://www.windowsazure.com/.. _SQL Server autocommit mode: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms187878%28v=sql.105%29.aspxBug fixes---------- Handle errors when calling Stored Procedures via the ``.callproc()`` pymssql  cursor method. Now it will raise a DB-API ``DatabaseException``; previously  it allowed a ``_mssql.MSSQLDatabaseException`` exception to surface.- Fixes in ``tds_version`` ``_mssql`` connections property value  Made it work with TDS protocol version 7.2. (GH-211)  The value returned for TDS version 7.1 is still 8.0 for backward  compatibility (this is because such feature got added in times when  Microsoft documentation labeled the two protocol versions that followed 7.0  as 8.0 and 9.0; later it changed them to 7.1 and 7.2 respectively) and will  be corrected in a future release (2.2).- PEP 249 compliance (GH-251)  Added type constructors to increase compatibility with other libraries.  Thanks Aymeric Augustin.- pymssql: Made handling of integer SP params more robust (GH-237)- Check lower bound value when convering integer values from to Python to SQL  (GH-238)Internals---------- Completed migration of the test suite from nose to py.test.- Added a few more test cases to our suite.- Tests: Modified a couple of test cases so the full suite can be run against  SQL Server 2005.- Added testing of successful build of documentation to Travis CI script.- Build process: Cleanup intermediate and ad-hoc anciliary files (GH-231,  GH-273)- setup.py: Fixed handling of release tarballs contents so no extraneous files  are shipped and the documentation tree is actually included. Also, removed  unused code.Version 2.1.0 - 2014-02-25 - `Marc Abramowitz &lt;http://marc-abramowitz.com/&gt;`_=============================================================================Features--------- Sphinx-based documentation (GH-149)  Read it online at http://pymssql.org/  Thanks, Ramiro Morales!  See:  * https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/149  * https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/162  * https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/164  * https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/165  * https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/166  * https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/167  * https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/169  * https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/174  * https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/175- &quot;Green&quot; support (GH-135)  Lets you use pymssql with cooperative multi-tasking systems like  gevent and have pymssql call a callback when it is waiting for a  response from the server. You can set this callback to yield to  another greenlet, coroutine, etc. For example, for gevent, you could  do::      def wait_callback(read_fileno):          gevent.socket.wait_read(read_fileno)      pymssql.set_wait_callback(wait_callback)  The above is useful if you're say, running a gunicorn server with the  gevent worker. With this callback in place, when you send a query to  SQL server and are waiting for a response, you can yield to other  greenlets and process other requests. This is super useful when you  have high concurrency and/or slow database queries and lets you use  less gunicorn worker processes and still handle high concurrency.  See https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/135- Better error messages.  E.g.: For a connection failure, instead of:      pymssql.OperationalError: (20009, 'Net-Lib error during Connection      refused')  the dberrstr is also included, resulting in:      pymssql.OperationalError: (20009, 'DB-Lib error message 20009,      severity 9:\nUnable to connect: Adaptive Server is unavailable or      does not exist\nNet-Lib error during Connection refused\n')  See:  * https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/151  In the area of error messages, we also made this change:  execute: Raise ColumnsWithoutNamesError when as_dict=True and missing  column names (GH-160)  because the previous behavior was very confusing; instead of raising  an exception, we would just return row dicts with those columns  missing. This prompted at least one question on the mailing list  (https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/pymssql/JoZpmNZFtxM),  so we thought it was better to handle this explicitly by raising an  exception, so the user would understand what went wrong.  See:  * https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/160  * https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/168- Performance improvements  You are most likely to notice a difference from these when you are  fetching a large number of rows.  * Reworked row fetching (GH-159)    There was a rather large amount of type conversion occuring when    fetching a row from pymssql. The number of conversions required have    been cut down significantly with these changes.    Thanks Damien, Churchill!    See:    * https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/158    * https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/159  * Modify get_row() to use the CPython tuple API (GH-178)    This drops the previous method of building up a row tuple and switches    to using the CPython API, which allows you to create a correctly sized    tuple at the beginning and simply fill it in. This appears to offer    around a 10% boost when fetching rows from a table where the data is    already in memory.    Thanks Damien, Churchill!    See:    * https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/178- MSSQLConnection: Add `with` (context manager) support (GH-171)  This adds `with` statement support for MSSQLConnection in the `_mssql`  module -- e.g.::      with mssqlconn() as conn:          conn.execute_query(&quot;SELECT @@version AS version&quot;)  We already have `with` statement support for the `pymssql` module.  See:  * https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/171- Allow passing in binary data (GH-179)  Use the bytesarray type added in Python 2.6 to signify that this is  binary data and to quote it accordingly. Also modify the handling of  str/bytes types checking the first 2 characters for b'0x' and insert  that as binary data.  See:  * https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/179- Add support for binding uuid.UUID instances to stored procedures input  params (GH-143)  Thanks, Ramiro Morales!  See:  * https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/143  * https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/commit/1689c83878304f735eb38b1c63c31e210b028ea7- The version number is now stored in one place, in pymssql_version.h  This makes it easier to update the version number and not forget any  places, like I did with pymssql 2.0.1  * See https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/commit/fd317df65fa62691c2af377e4661defb721b2699- Improved support for using py.test as test runner (GH-183)  * See: https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/183- Improved PEP-8 and pylint complianceBug Fixes---------- GH-142 (&quot;Change how ``*.pyx`` files are included in package&quot;) - this  should prevent pymssql.pyx and _mssql.pyx from getting copied into the  root of your virtualenv. Thanks, @Arfrever!  * See: https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/issues/142- GH-145 (&quot;Prevent error string growing with repeated failed connection  attempts.&quot;)  See:  * https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/issues/145  * https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/146- GH-151 (&quot;err_handler: Don't clobber dberrstr with oserrstr&quot;)  * https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/151- GH-152 (&quot;_mssql.pyx: Zero init global last_msg_* vars&quot;)  See: https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/152- GH-177 (&quot;binary columns sometimes are processed as varchar&quot;)  Better mechanism for pymssql to detect that user is passing binary  data.  See: https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/issues/177- buffer overflow fix (GH-182)  * See: https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/181  * See: https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/182- Return uniqueidentifer columns as uuid.UUID objects on Python 3See `ChangeLog`_ for older history..... _PyPI: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymssql/2.0.0.. _Travis CI: https://travis-ci.org/pymssql/pymssql.. _Cython: http://cython.org/.. _ChangeLog: https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/blob/master/ChangeLog</longdescription>

This can be used, in example, when you need to send some data that could be tampered by the user, like a payment authorization, or a login token. This data travels in plaintext, and can be read, but it can't be modified in any way once signed!.## Why would I need to use it?* To sign data that needs to be sent through an untrusted channel, like signing a cookie with user data and providing it to the user, so the user can identify themselves with the rest of the system safely.* To save database lookups by checking signed data, like an account activation or password reset link where you can sign the user id and then verify it securely without using a database.* To prevent data tampering, like signing some value that goes in a form hidden field such as the user type (admin or regular) so that the user can't trick the value.* To easily express intent when signing data, like sharing a single secret key between signers to simplify app configuration and use the `personalisation` parameter to prevent signed data misuse.In short, **never trust** user input, **always verify**. This module helps you do that.## Why would I want to use it?Because it is a relatively *small* (around 900 logical lines of code, core around 400), *simple* (the public API has only a couple of methods) yet very *customizable* and *fast* data signer. My idea is to keep it as uncomplicated as possible without much room to become a *footgun*. All *defaults are very sane* (secure) and everything *just works* out of the box.There are much better packages for other or more general use cases so if you feel this doesn't satisfy your needs please [leave a feature request](https://gitlab.com/hackancuba/blake2signer/-/issues) or consider using [itsdangerous](https://itsdangerous.palletsprojects.com), [Django's signer](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/signing), [pypaseto](https://github.com/rlittlefield/pypaseto), [pyjwt](https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt) or others like those.## Goals* Be safe and secure.* Be simple and straightforward.* Follow [semver](https://semver.org/).* Be always typed.* No dependencies (besides dev).* 100% coverage.### Secondary goals* If possible, maintain current active Python versions (3.7+).## InstallingThis package is hosted on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/blake2signer) so just:* `python3 -m pip install blake2signer`* `poetry add blake2signer`* `pipenv install blake2signer`You can check the [releases' page](https://gitlab.com/hackancuba/blake2signer/-/releases) for package hashes and signatures.Note: if you want to use BLAKE3, you need to install the [`blake3`](https://pypi.org/project/blake3/) package, until it arrives to core (which may or may not happen). Alternatively, you can install this package with extras:* `python3 -m pip install blake2signer[blake3]`* `poetry add blake2signer[blake3]`* `pipenv install blake2signer[blake3]`### RequirementsOnly Python is required, this module doesn't have dependencies besides those used for development, and the optional `blake3`.Versions currently tested (check the [pipelines](https://gitlab.com/hackancuba/blake2signer/-/pipelines)):* CPython 3.7* CPython 3.8* CPython 3.9* CPython 3.10* CPython 3.11* CPython 3.12rc* [PyPy](https://www.pypy.org) 3.7    * If you are contributing to this project under PyPy, [read the contrib notes first](CONTRIB.md#working-under-pypy).* [PyPy](https://www.pypy.org) 3.8    * If you are contributing to this project under PyPy, [read the contrib notes first](CONTRIB.md#working-under-pypy).* [PyPy](https://www.pypy.org) 3.9    * If you are contributing to this project under PyPy, [read the contrib notes first](CONTRIB.md#working-under-pypy).* [Stackless](https://github.com/stackless-dev/stackless/wiki) 3.7    * If you are contributing to this project under Stackless, [read the contrib notes first](CONTRIB.md#working-under-stackless).* [Stackless](https://github.com/stackless-dev/stackless/wiki) 3.8    * If you are contributing to this project under Stackless, [read the contrib notes first](CONTRIB.md#working-under-stackless).## Tl; Dr Example```python&quot;&quot;&quot;Tl;dr example.&quot;&quot;&quot;from datetime import timedeltafrom blake2signer import Blake2SerializerSignerfrom blake2signer import errorssecret = b'secure-secret-that-nobody-knows!'# Some arbitrary data to signdata = {'user_id': 1, 'is_admin': True, 'username': 'hackan'}signer = Blake2SerializerSigner(    secret,    max_age=timedelta(days=1),  # Add a timestamp to the signature    personalisation=b'the-cookie-signer',)# Sign and i.e. store the data in a cookiesigned = signer.dumps(data)  # Compression is enabled by default# If compressing data turns out to be detrimental then data won't be# compressed.

Its public methods are `dumps`, `loads`, `dumps_parts` and `loads_parts`, and `dump` and `load` for files.* **Blake2Signer**: a signer class that simply salts, signs and verifies signed data as bytes or string. Its public methods are `sign`, `unsign`, `sign_parts` and `unsign_parts`.* **Blake2TimestampSigner**: a signer class that simply salts, signs and verifies signed timestamped data as bytes or string. Its public methods are `sign`, `unsign`, `sign_parts` and `unsign_parts`.**You should generally go for Blake2SerializerSigner**, given that it's the most versatile of the three, unless you need to deal with plain bytes or string. Check [details about signers](https://blake2signer.hackan.net/en/stable/details) and [usage examples](https://blake2signer.hackan.net/en/stable/examples) to learn more.## DocumentationCheck out this [project docs online](https://blake2signer.hackan.net), or locally with `inv docs`.

	<longdescription># Network Automation Simplified - NAMSAPI to the ncclient, nornir and napalm libraries that promotes code reuse, reduces development time and simplifies network automation in Python.   All network changes have a set or subset of functions in common.NAMS supports many functions across multiple vendor platforms, that are executed in a predetermined order.  This simplifies the automation process, without restricting the user to adomain-specific language (DSL) or sacrificing flexability, granularity or speed.  ## InstallationDownload as a Python package or deploy as a Docker Container.  Docker Container is recommended for exploring code examples.### Python Package##### Ubuntu```apt-get install python3.7 python3.7-dev python3-pippython3.7 -m pip install network-automation-simplified```https://pypi.org/project/network-automation-simplified/### Docker*Important*: the docker container will only save host data stored in the &quot;/home&quot; and &quot;/svr/nams&quot; directories.  All other data will be lost upon reboot/shutdown.##### Linux```sudo apt-get updatesudo apt-get install docker docker-composegit clone &lt;project path&gt;cd cox_nams/docker &amp;&amp; sudo bash build.sh```##### Mac```# 'brew' must be installedbrew install dockerbrew install docker-composebrew install docker-machinegit clone &lt;project path&gt;cd &lt;project name&gt;/dockerbash build.sh```##### Authentication| Defaults |  Shell  |   SSH   | Jupyter |  HTTP ||:--------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-----:|| username |  root   | admin   |   n/a   |  n/a  || password | install | install |  n/a    |  n/a  || port     |   n/a   | 10000   | 10001   | 10002 |##### Interfaces| Service | Client Interface | Example                       ||---------|------------------|-------------------------------|| Linux   | host's shell     | docker exec -it nams bash     || SSH     | ssh client       | ssh \&lt;user\&gt;@\&lt;host_ip\&gt; -p 10000 || Jupyter | web browser      | http://\&lt;host_ip\&gt;:10001        || HTTP    | web browser      | http://\&lt;host_ip\&gt;:10002        |##### ProblemsIts possible that the host's docker network can assign a subnet that overlaps with devices you are attempting to connect to via nams.  In this case, static routes are required on the host. e.g. create a static route to '172.17.248.0/24' if the Docker subnet is '172.17.0.0/16' and the router is '172.17.248.1/32'.## Automation Libraries #### ncclientncclient is Python library for interfacing with a NETCONF device.  ncclient is leveraged by tools like Jsnapy and Ansible.  It is vendor neutral and provides a 'raw', or unabstracted interface.  The downside of working with ncclient is that it requires the user to perform inventory management, multiprocessing, error-handling, encoding conversions, file saving, etc.https://ncclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#### NornirNornir is a relatively new Python framework developed by the same creators of NAPALM and netmiko.  It's primary role is to provide inventory management and multiprocessing for APIs like ncclient, NAPALM, netmiko, and others.  One downfall of Nornir the ability to integrate Jsnapy.  This is a critical component for health checks on Juniper devices.  Because Nornir is an Open framework, a component of the framework, like inventory, can be re-used by others.  Nornir's inventory is re-used by NAMS.https://nornir.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#### JsnapyJsnapy is an excellent Python tool for executing health checks against JunOS platforms.  It abstracts netconf requests and responses, by allowing test case definitions via a 'yaml' file.  In the yaml file, various parameters state parameters of 'show' output can be validated.  When a response is received and the test case passes, the node is considered health (vice versa for a failure).  Jsnapy uses ncclient to interface with a device.https://github.com/Juniper/jsnapy#### NAPALMNAPALM is unified API for multi-vendor network environments.  It translates high-level 'orders' into CLI commands.  Additionally, it returns output as Python objects e.g. lists, dictionaries, etc. for easy parsing. This output is the same for all vendors.  However, because there are so many results that would have to be translated into Python objects, not all commands are supported.  Additionally, some vendors have support than others.  The majority of support is in EOS systems which are uncommon to most network environments.  To workaround this, the developers allow interfacing with devices through Netconf or netmiko without translating results but while performing with error handling.  In a network domain of Juniper routers, it makes more sense to avoid the NAPALM API and leverage Juniper's Jsnapy interface with ncclient.  This is because Jsnapy cannot easily be integrated into NAPALM without developer involvement.https://napalm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#### AnsibleAnsible is a YAML driven, network automation solution that supports native commands and Netconf for multiple vendors.  It has an excellent inventory system for device management and generating configurations.  YAML is a simple 'language' that users interface with; this hides the underlying Python code.  Because of YAML abstraction, Ansible sacrifices flexibility.  YAML is also not a 'programming language'.  This can make seemingly simple tasks quite difficult to 'program' or even impossible.  Another downside of Ansible is that an operation is executed on *all* routers before the next operation is performed. Examples below describe some scenarios that become quite challenging or impossible with Ansible:1. *Group Operations*:  Executing multiple operations on a single router before moving to the next.  Additionally, user prompting at each device.2. *Conditional Operations*: Suppose you want you want to get the configuration from all routers, find routers with 'X' configuration, and then make a change to only those select routers.3. *Speed*: Each operation requires a new SSH / NETCONF session.  Suppose you have two tasks (1) get configuration (2) edit configuration.  Each operation requires a new session.https://docs.ansible.com/</longdescription>

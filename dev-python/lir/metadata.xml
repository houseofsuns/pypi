	<longdescription>LIR Python Likelihood Ratio Library===================================This library provides a collection of scripts to aid calibration, andcalculation and evaluation of Likelihood Ratios.## A simple score-based LR systemA score-based LR system needs a scorer and a calibrator. The most basic setupuses a training set and a test set. Both the scorer and the calibrator arefitted on the training set.```pythonimport lirimport numpy as npfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegressionfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split# generate some data randomly from a normal distributionX = np.concatenate([np.random.normal(loc=0, size=(100, 1)),              np.random.normal(loc=1, size=(100, 1))])y = np.concatenate([np.zeros(100), np.ones(100)])# split the data into train and testX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)# initialize a scorer and a calibratorscorer = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs')  # choose any sklearn style classifiercalibrator = lir.KDECalibrator()  # use plain KDE for calibrationcalibrated_scorer = lir.CalibratedScorer(scorer, calibrator)# fit and predictcalibrated_scorer.fit(X_train, y_train)lrs_test = calibrated_scorer.predict_lr(X_test)# print the quality of the system as log likelihood ratio cost (lower is better)print('The log likelihood ratio cost is', lir.metrics.cllr(lrs_test, y_test), '(lower is better)')print('The discriminative power is', lir.metrics.cllr_min(lrs_test, y_test), '(lower is better)')# plot calibrationimport lir.plottingwith lir.plotting.show() as ax:    ax.pav(lrs_test, y_test)```The log likelihood ratio cost (CLLR) may be used as a metric of performance.In this case it should yield a value of around .8, but highly variable due tothe small number of samples. Increase the sample size to get more stableresults.</longdescription>

Note that the libjpeg-turbo SIMD source code bears the [zlib License]https://opensource.org/licenses/Zlib, but in the context of the overall libjpeg API library, the terms of the zlib License are subsumed by the terms of the IJG License. - The Modified 3-clause BSD License, which is listed below This license applies to the TurboJPEG API library and associated programs, as well as the build system. Note that the TurboJPEG API library wraps the libjpeg API library, so in the context of the overall TurboJPEG API library, both the terms of the IJG License and the terms of the Modified 3-clause BSD License apply. Complying with the libjpeg-turbo Licenses ========================================= This section provides a roll-up of the libjpeg-turbo licensing terms, to the best of our understanding. This is not a license in and of itself. It is intended solely for clarification. 1. If you are distributing a modified version of the libjpeg-turbo source, then: 1. You cannot alter or remove any existing copyright or license notices from the source. **Origin** - Clause 1 of the IJG License - Clause 1 of the Modified BSD License - Clauses 1 and 3 of the zlib License 2. You must add your own copyright notice to the header of each source file you modified, so others can tell that you modified that file. If there is not an existing copyright header in that file, then you can simply add a notice stating that you modified the file. **Origin** - Clause 1 of the IJG License - Clause 2 of the zlib License 3. You must include the IJG README file, and you must not alter any of the copyright or license text in that file. **Origin** - Clause 1 of the IJG License 2. If you are distributing only libjpeg-turbo binaries without the source, or if you are distributing an application that statically links with libjpeg-turbo, then: 1. Your product documentation must include a message stating: This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group. **Origin** - Clause 2 of the IJG license 2. If your binary distribution includes or uses the TurboJPEG API, then your product documentation must include the text of the Modified BSD License see below. **Origin** - Clause 2 of the Modified BSD License 3. You cannot use the name of the IJG or The libjpeg-turbo Project or the contributors thereof in advertising, publicity, etc. **Origin** - IJG License - Clause 3 of the Modified BSD License 4. The IJG and The libjpeg-turbo Project do not warrant libjpeg-turbo to be free of defects, nor do we accept any liability for undesirable consequences resulting from your use of the software. **Origin** - IJG License - Modified BSD License - zlib License The Modified 3-clause BSD License =================================== Copyright C2009-2024 D. R. Commander. All Rights Reserved.<br> Copyright C2015 Viktor Szathmry. All Rights Reserved.

Why Two Licenses ================= The zlib License could have been used instead of the Modified 3-clause BSD License, and since the IJG License effectively subsumes the distribution conditions of the zlib License, this would have effectively placed libjpeg-turbo binary distributions under the IJG License. However, the IJG License specifically refers to the Independent JPEG Group and does not extend attribution and endorsement protections to other entities. Thus, it was desirable to choose a license that granted us the same protections for new code that were granted to the IJG for code derived from their software. ================================================================================ Content of: /Users/runner/work/simplejpeg/simplejpeg/lib/libjpeg-turbo-3.1.0/README.ijg ================================================================================ libjpeg-turbo note: This file has been modified by The libjpeg-turbo Project to include only information relevant to libjpeg-turbo, to wordsmith certain sections, and to remove impolitic language that existed in the libjpeg v8 README. It is included only for reference. Please see README.md for information specific to libjpeg-turbo.

OVERVIEW ======== This package contains C software to implement JPEG image encoding, decoding, and transcoding. JPEG pronounced jay-peg is a standardized compression method for full-color and grayscale images. JPEG's strong suit is compressing photographic images or other types of images that have smooth color and brightness transitions between neighboring pixels. Images with sharp lines or other abrupt features may not compress well with JPEG, and a higher JPEG quality may have to be used to avoid visible compression artifacts with such images. JPEG is normally lossy, meaning that the output pixels are not necessarily identical to the input pixels. However, on photographic content and other smooth images, very good compression ratios can be obtained with no visible compression artifacts, and extremely high compression ratios are possible if you are willing to sacrifice image quality by reducing the quality setting in the compressor. This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, progressive, and lossless compression processes. Provision is made for supporting all variants of these processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren't implemented yet. We have made no provision for supporting the hierarchical processes defined in the standard. We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files, plus two sample applications cjpeg and djpeg, which use the library to perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats. The library is intended to be reused in other applications. In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability; for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats. These extra functions can be compiled out of the library if not required for a particular application. We have also included jpegtran, a utility for lossless transcoding between different JPEG processes, and rdjpgcom and wrjpgcom, two simple applications for inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files. The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful. In particular, the software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG. See the REFERENCES section for introductory material. Rather, it is intended to be reliable, portable, industrial-strength code. We do not claim to have achieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it. We welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products. No royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement in product documentation, as described under LEGAL ISSUES.

REFERENCES ========== We recommend reading one or more of these references before trying to understand the innards of the JPEG software. The best short technical introduction to the JPEG compression algorithm is Wallace, Gregory K. The JPEG Still Picture Compression Standard, Communications of the ACM, April 1991 vol. 34 no. 4, pp. 30-44. Adjacent articles in that issue discuss MPEG motion picture compression, applications of JPEG, and related topics. If you don't have the CACM issue handy, a PDF file containing a revised version of Wallace's article is available at http://www.ijg.org/files/Wallace.JPEG.pdf. The file actually a preprint for an article that appeared in IEEE Trans. Consumer Electronics omits the sample images that appeared in CACM, but it includes corrections and some added material. Note: the Wallace article is copyright ACM and IEEE, and it may not be used for commercial purposes. A somewhat less technical, more leisurely introduction to JPEG can be found in The Data Compression Book by Mark Nelson and Jean-loup Gailly, published by M&T Books New York, 2nd ed. 1996, ISBN 1-55851-434-1. This book provides good explanations and example C code for a multitude of compression methods including JPEG. It is an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C code but don't know much about data compression in general. The book's JPEG sample code is far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look at a full implementation, you've got one here... The best currently available description of JPEG is the textbook JPEG Still Image Data Compression Standard by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L. Mitchell, published by Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1. Price US59.95, 638 pp. The book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG standards DIS 10918-1 and draft DIS 10918-2. The original JPEG standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the actual specification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods. Part 1 is titled Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 1: Requirements and guidelines and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-1, ITU-T T.81. Part 2 is titled Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 2: Compliance testing and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83. The JPEG standard does not specify all details of an interchangeable file format. For the omitted details, we follow the JFIF conventions, revision 1.02. JFIF version 1 has been adopted as ISO/IEC 10918-5 05/2013 and Recommendation ITU-T T.871 05/2011: Information technology - Digital compression and coding of continuous-tone still images: JPEG File Interchange Format JFIF. It is available as a free download in PDF file format from https://www.iso.org/standard/54989.html and http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.871. A PDF file of the older JFIF 1.02 specification is available at http://www.w3.org/Graphics/JPEG/jfif3.pdf. The TIFF 6.0 file format specification can be obtained from http://mirrors.ctan.org/graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.gz. The JPEG incorporation scheme found in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious problems. IJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design TIFF Compression tag 6. Instead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technical Note #2 Compression tag 7. Copies of this Note can be obtained from http://www.ijg.org/files/. It is expected that the next revision of the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note's design. Although IJG's own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff library uses our library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note. ARCHIVE LOCATIONS ================= The official archive site for this software is www.ijg.org. The most recent released version can always be found there in directory files. The JPEG FAQ Frequently Asked Questions article is a source of some general information about JPEG. It is available at http://www.faqs.org/faqs/jpeg-faq. FILE FORMAT COMPATIBILITY ========================= This software implements ITU T.81 ISO/IEC 10918 with some extensions from ITU T.871 ISO/IEC 10918-5 JPEG File Interchange Format-- see REFERENCES. Informally, the term JPEG image or JPEG file most often refers to JFIF or a subset thereof, but there are other formats containing the name JPEG that are incompatible with the original JPEG standard or with JFIF for instance, JPEG 2000 and JPEG XR. This software therefore does not support these formats. Indeed, one of the original reasons for developing this free software was to help force convergence on a common, interoperable format standard for JPEG files. JFIF is a minimal or low end representation. TIFF/JPEG TIFF revision 6.0 as modified by TIFF Technical Note #2 can be used for high end applications that need to record a lot of additional data about an image.

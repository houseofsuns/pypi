	<longdescription>oset=====Set that remembers original insertion order.Runs on Py2.5 or later (and runs on 3.0 or later without any modifications). For Python2.5, a local backport of ABC classes is also used.Implementation based on a doubly linked link and an internal dictionary. This design gives OrderedSet the same big-Oh running times as regular sets including O(1) adds, removes, and lookups as well as O(n) iteration.Usage-----Import and create ordered set.::    &gt;&gt;&gt; from oset import oset    &gt;&gt;&gt; os = oset()Requires-------- - Python 2.5+Changes=======Version 0.1-------------- http://code.activestate.com/recipes/576694-orderedset/- Raymond Hettinger, 19 Mar 2009 Contributors============  - Raymond Hettinger, (All kudos to him :)- Carlos Martin &lt;inean.es@gmail.com&gt;under the `Python Software Foundation License &lt;http://www.opensource.org/licenses/PythonSoftFoundation.php&gt;`_.License=======Copyright (c) 2009, Raymond Hettinger, and othersAll rights reserved.Package structured based on the one developed to odictCopyright (c) 2010, BlueDynamics Alliance, Austria* Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this   list of conditions and the following disclaimer.* Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this   list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or   other materials provided with the distribution.* Neither the name of the BlueDynamics Alliance nor the names of its   contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this   software without specific prior written permission.

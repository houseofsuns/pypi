	<longdescription>Faraday Agents Dispatcher helps user develop integrations with[Faraday][faraday] written in any language. &lt;!-- For more information, check [thisblogpost][blogpost] or continue reading. --&gt;[faraday]: https://github.com/infobyte/faraday/[plugins]: https://github.com/infobyte/faraday_plugins[blogpost]: https://medium.com/faraday# InstallationJust run `pip3 install faraday_agent_dispatcher` and you should see the`faraday-dispatcher` command in your system.To setup a development environment (this is, to change code of the dispatcheritself, not to write your own integrations), you should clone this repo and run`pip install -e .`.# Running Faraday Agent Dispatcher for first time1. Generate a configuration file running `faraday-dispatcherconfig-wizard`.2. Run the agent with `faraday-dispatcher run` command. The config filethat it creates will be located in `~/.faraday/config/dispatcher.ini`if you do not pass a custom path.You should complete the agent configuration with your registrationtoken, located at http://localhost:5985/#/admin/agents. Check that theserver section has the correct information about your FaradayServer instance. Then, complete the agent section with the desired nameof your agent. Finally, [add the executors](#configuring-a-executor)# Executors## Creating your own executorsAn executor is a script that prints out **single-line** JSON data tostdout. Remember that if you print any other data to stdout, thedispatcher will trigger an error. If you want to print debugging orlogging information you should use stderr for that.Every line written to stdout by the executor will be decoded by thedispatcher and sent to Faraday using the Bulk Create endpoint.Therefore, the JSON you print must have the schema that the endpointrequires (this schema is detailed [below](#bulk-create-json-format)).Otherwise, the dispatcher will complain because you supplied invaliddata to it.If you want to debug your executor, the simplest way to do it is byrunning it directly instead of running with the Dispatcher. Since the executorjust prints JSON data to stdout, you will be able to see allinformation it wants to send to Faraday, but without actually sendingit.## Configuring a executorAfter writing your executor, you have to add it with the`faraday-dispatcher config-wizard` within the executor section, addingits name, command to execute and the max size of the JSON to send toFaraday Server. Additionally, you can configure the Environmentvariables and Arguments in their proper section.## Running a executorTo run an executor use the `faraday-dispatcher config-wizard` command,and play it from the Faraday Server. The executor will use theenvironment variables set and ask for the arguments.# Bulk Create JSON formatThe data published to [faraday][faraday] must correspond to the`bulk_create` endpoint of the [Faraday's REST API][API]# Running multiple dispatchersIf you want to have more than one dispatcher, each one runninng its ownexecutors, the preferred of doing this is to create differentconfiguration files for each one (for example,`~/.faraday/config/dispatcher-1.ini` and`~/.faraday/config/dispatcher-2.ini`). Then, you can run two differentDispatcher instances with `faraday-dispatcher --config-filePATH_TO_A_CONFIG_FILE`.# ExecutorsInside the [executors][executors] directory you can find the alreadycreated executors.## OfficialThe [official executors][official_executors] are the collection of ready-to-goexecutors (with minimum configuration with the wizard). They have a manifestJSON file, which gives details about the uses of the executor and helps withthe configuration of them.The current official executors are:* [Arachni][arachni]* [Burp][burp]* [CrackMapExec][crackmap]* [Nessus][nessus]* [Nikto][nikto]* [Nmap][nmap]* [Nuclei][nuclei]* [Openvas][openvas]* Report processor: Consumes a local report where the dispatcher is with the [faraday plugins][plugins]* [QualysGuard] [qualys]* [Sonar Qube API][sonarqubeapi]* [Sublist3r][sublist3r]* [W3af][w3af]* [Wpscan][wpscan]* [Zap][zap]## DevelopmentThe [development executors][dev_executors] are the collection of executors wedo **not** fully maintain, we have examples of use, conceptual, and indevelopment executors. The most important of them are:* `basic_example.py`: The Hello World of Faraday executors. It will  create a host with an associeted vulnerability to it* `heroku_discovery_agent.py`: Load host and service information from  your Heroku account* `prowlerSample.py`: Run the [**prowler**][prowler] command and send  its output to Faraday* `brainfuck.sh`: A proof-of-concept to demonstrate you can create  an executor in any programming language, including [Brainfuck][brainfuck]![executors]: https://github.com/infobyte/faraday_agent_dispatcher/tree/master/faraday_agent_dispatcher/static/executors[official_executors]: https://github.com/infobyte/faraday_agent_dispatcher/tree/master/faraday_agent_dispatcher/static/executors/official[dev_executors]: https://github.com/infobyte/faraday_agent_dispatcher/tree/master/faraday_agent_dispatcher/static/executors/dev[brainfuck]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck[prowler]: https://github.com/toniblyx/prowler[nessus]: https://www.nessus.org[nikto]: https://cirt.net/Nikto2[nmap]: https://nmap.org[nuclei]: https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei[qualys]: https://www.qualys.com/[sonarqubeapi]: https://www.sonarqube.org/[sublist3r]: https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r[w3af]: http://w3af.org/[wpscan]: https://wpscan.org/[arachni]: https://www.arachni-scanner.com/[openvas]: https://www.openvas.org/[zap]: https://www.zaproxy.org/[burp]: https://www.portswigger.net/burp[crackmap]: https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec# RoadmapWe are currently working on new executors, apart from improving theexperience using the agents.We would like to give some agents read access to their workspace,so they can benefit of the existing data in order to find more valuableinformation.# DocumentationFor more info you can check our [documentation][doc][doc]: https://docs.agents.faradaysec.com[API]: https://api.faradaysec.com/2.6.3 [Aug 24th, 2023]:--- * [FIX] Check the code response for burp executor #1942.6.2 [Aug 3rd, 2023]:--- * [MOD] Now you can download a existing report in tenableio #1922.6.1 [July 20th, 2023]:--- * [FIX] Now nuclei executor use -j flag instead of -json. #1872.6.0 [July 7th, 2023]:--- * [ADD] Add HCL Appscan executer #1862.5.1 [Jan 3rd, 2023]:--- * [DEL] Now nuclei doesn't check if the target is an ip * [MOD] Add a fixes for bandit vuln:   - Replace assert return code with a if   - Remove default x_token in nessus executor2.5.0 [Nov 30th, 2022]:--- * [ADD] Add new Sonar Qube executor * [ADD] Add tenableio executor * [FIX] Make gvm executor compatible with new version of python-gvm * [FIX] Now if a venv is int or float it will convert to string2.4.0 [Oct 26th. 2022]:--- * Add Qualys executor * [MOD] Change pgrep for psutil in zap executor2.3.0 [Sep 5th, 2022]:--- * Now InsighVM's executer will executa a scan if a site_id is provided * Add tags for plugins * Add installation in docker file for nmap script: vulners * Now the api-key from zap is a enviroment variable * [FIX] Change AGENT_CONFIG_HOSTNAME_RESOLUTION por AGENT_CONFIG_RESOLVE_HOSTNAME * Update docs2.2.0 [Jul 25th, 2022]:--- * Add timeout parameter to arachni's executor * Add python2.7, w3af and its dependencies to docker image * Add ignore_info and hostname_resolution options for most executors. * Nessus now list in the logs the available templates and uses posixpath.join instead of concat strings.Nikto now uses only requieres TARGET_URL argument. * Fix logs and change .format to fstrings * Remove ws from dispatcher.yaml. * Now faraday-dispatcher send the parameters of the executors when itconnects to faraday server.

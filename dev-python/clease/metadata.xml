It provides a comprehensive list of tools for specifying parameters for CE, generating training structures, fitting effective cluster interaction (ECI) values and running Monte Carlo simulations. A detailed description of the package can be found in the [documentation](https://clease.readthedocs.io/) and our [paper](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-648X/ab1bbc).For information on how to contribute to CLEASE, please see the [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.# InstallationInstall the CLEASE code by executing```bashpip install clease```Alternative, CLEASE is also available through anaconda on [conda](https://conda.io) via [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/).We recommend installing CLEASE via conda on windows machines in order to simplify compilations, as pip tends to havea hard time compiling the C++ code. Install into your conda environment:```shconda install -c conda-forge clease```## Graphical User InterfaceClease has a stand-alone jupyter notebook GUI, which is capable of performing mostof the standard CE routines. It can be found [here](https://clease-gui.readthedocs.io).CLEASE GUI can be installed from PyPI or anaconda using one of the two following commands.### PyPI```bashpip install clease[gui]```### Anaconda```bashconda install -c conda-forge clease-gui```## DevelopmentIf you are a developer you might want to install CLEASE by executing the following command in the root folder of the project```bashpip install -e .```In order to run the tests, the testing dependencies should be installed. They can be installed with the extra`test` option```bashpip install .[test]```There is an additional option for development purposes, `dev`, which contains some convenience packages.All of the extras options can be installed via the `all` option,i.e.```bashpip install .[all]```Note, that if you are using `zsh`, you need to [escape the argument](https://stackoverflow.com/a/30539963), e.g.```bashpip install '.[all]'```## TroubleshootingIf you are running on Mac and get the error```bashfatal error: 'ios' file not found```try this before installing```bashexport MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.14```</longdescription>

	<longdescription>Ingenico Connect Python SDK===========================Introduction------------The Python SDK helps you to communicate with the `Ingenico Connect &lt;https://epayments.developer-ingenico.com/&gt;`__ Server API. Its primary features are:-  convenient Python library for the API calls and responses   -  marshalls Python request objects to HTTP requests   -  unmarshalls HTTP responses to Python response objects or Python exceptions-  handling of all the details concerning authentication-  handling of required meta dataIts use is demonstrated by an example for each possible call. The examples execute a call using the provided API keys.See the `Ingenico Connect Developer Hub &lt;https://epayments.developer-ingenico.com/documentation/sdk/server/python/&gt;`__ for more information on how to use the SDK.Structure of this repository----------------------------This repository consists out of four main components:#. The source code of the SDK itself: ``/ingenico/connect/sdk/``#. The source code of the SDK unit tests: ``/tests/unit/``#. The source code of the SDK integration tests: ``/tests/integration/``#. Usage examples: ``/examples/``Note that the source code of the unit tests and integration tests and the examples can only be found on GitHub.Requirements------------Python 2.7 is required. In addition, the following packages are required:-  `requests &lt;https://requests.readthedocs.io/&gt;`__ 2.25.0 or higher-  `requests-toolbelt &lt;https://toolbelt.readthedocs.io/&gt;`__ 0.8.0 or higherThese packages will be installed automatically if the SDK is installed manually or using pip following the below instructions.Installation------------To install the SDK using pip, execute the following command:.. code:: bash   pip install connect-sdk-python2Alternatively, you can install the SDK from a source distribution file:#. Download the latest version of the Python SDK from GitHub. Choose the ``connect-sdk-python2-x.y.z.zip`` file from the `releases &lt;https://github.com/Ingenico-ePayments/connect-sdk-python2/releases&gt;`__ page, where ``x.y.z`` is the version number.#. Execute the following command in the folder where the SDK was downloaded to:   .. code:: bash      pip install connect-sdk-python2-x.y.z.zipUninstalling------------After the Python SDK has been installed, it can be uninstalled using the following command:.. code:: bash   pip uninstall connect-sdk-python2The required packages can be uninstalled in the same way.Running tests-------------There are two types of tests: unit tests and integration tests. The unit tests will work out-of-the-box; for the integration tests some configuration is required.First, some environment variables need to be set:-  ``connect.api.apiKeyId`` for the API key id to use. This can be retrieved from the Configuration Center.-  ``connect.api.secretApiKey`` for the secret API key to use. This can be retrieved from the Configuration Center.-  ``connect.api.merchantId`` for your merchant ID.In addition, to run the proxy integration tests, the proxy URI, username and password should be set in the ``tests/resources/configuration.proxy.ini`` file.In order to run the unit and integration tests, the `mock &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mock&gt;`__ backport and `mockito &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mockito&gt;`__ are required. These can be installed using the following command:.. code:: bash   pip install mock 'mockito&lt;1.3.1'The following commands can now be executed from the ``tests`` directory to execute the tests:-  Unit tests:   .. code:: bash      python run_unit_tests.py-  Integration tests:   .. code:: bash      python run_integration_tests.py-  Both unit and integration tests:   .. code:: bash      python run_all_tests.pyNote: in the current version of the unit tests, two errors will pop up ([Errno 10053] for Windows and [Errno 32] for Linux), indicating that there was a client disconnect. These errors occur during cleanup of the tests and do not hinder the tests in any way, and should therefore be ignored.</longdescription>

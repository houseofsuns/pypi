Assuming ``facility`` is configured in ``app_config`` to only schedule appointments on [TU, TH]:.. code-block:: python    from datetime import datetime    from dateutil.relativedelta import TU, TH    from django.conf import settings    from django.utils import timezone    from zoneifo import ZoneInfo    from .facility import Facility    from .models import Holiday    Holiday.objects.create(        name='Id-ul-Adha (Feast of the Sacrifice)',        date=date(2015, 9, 24)    )    suggested_datetime = datetime(2015, 9, 24, tzinfo=ZoneInfo(&quot;UTC&quot;))  # TH    available_datetime = facility.available_datetime(suggested_datetime)    print(available_datetime)  # 2015-09-29 00:00:00, TUThe maximum number of possible scheduling slots per day is configured in ``app_config``. As with the holiday example above, the appointment date will be incremented forward to a day with an available slot.System checks+++++++++++++* ``edc_facility.001`` Holiday file not found! settings.HOLIDAY_FILE not defined.* ``edc_facility.002`` Holiday file not found.* ``edc_facility.003`` Holiday table is empty. Run management command 'import_holidays'.* ``edc_facility.004`` No Holidays have been defined for this country.HealthFacility model++++++++++++++++++++The ``HealthFacility`` model is used by ``edc-next-appointment`` when reporting the next routineappointment for a participant. This is important for trials that collect data at routine clinic appointmentsnot set by the research staff or defined by the protocol.See also ``edc-next-appointment``.If you need to customize the model, declare the concrete model locally in your app. You can use the mixins to buildyour own classes.You'll also need to update ``settings`` to tell ``edc_facility`` where the custom model is::    EDC_FACILITY_HEALTH_FACILITY_MODEL = &quot;myapp.healthfacility&quot;For example:.. code-block:: python    # models.py    class HealthFacility(SiteModelMixin, HealthFacilityModelMixin, BaseUuidModel):        objects = Manager()        on_site = CurrentSiteManager()        history = HistoricalRecords()        class Meta(SiteModelMixin.Meta, BaseUuidModel.Meta):            verbose_name = &quot;Health Facility&quot;            verbose_name_plural = &quot;Health Facilities&quot;.. code-block:: python    # forms.py    class HealthFacilityForm(FormValidatorMixin, forms.ModelForm):        form_validator_cls = HealthFacilityFormValidator        class Meta:            model = HealthFacility            fields = &quot;__all__&quot;.. code-block:: python    # admin.py    @admin.register(HealthFacility, site=intecomm_facility_admin)    class HealthFacilityAdmin(        HealthFacilityModelAdminMixin,        SiteModelAdminMixin,        BaseModelAdminMixin,    ):        form = HealthFacilityForm.. |pypi| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/edc-facility.svg    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/edc-facility.. |actions| image:: https://github.com/clinicedc/edc-facility/workflows/build/badge.svg?branch=develop  :target: https://github.com/clinicedc/edc-facility/actions?query=workflow:build.. |codecov| image:: https://codecov.io/gh/clinicedc/edc-facility/branch/develop/graph/badge.svg  :target: https://codecov.io/gh/clinicedc/edc-facility.. |downloads| image:: https://pepy.tech/badge/edc-facility   :target: https://pepy.tech/project/edc-facility</longdescription>

	<longdescription>[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/pyhunter.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/pyhunter)# PyHunter## A Python wrapper for the Hunter.io v2 API### InstallationRequirements:* Python 3 (no Python 2 version, c'mon, we're in 2017!)To install:```bashpip install pyhunter```### UsagePyHunter supports all the methods from the [Hunter.io](https://hunter.io/api/v2/docs) v2 API:* `domain_search`* `email_finder`* `email_verifier`* `email_count`* `account_information`PyHunter also supports new methods from the `Leads` and `Leads Lists` APIs.### How to use PyHunterImport the PyHunter and instantiate it:```pythonfrom pyhunter import PyHunter``````pythonhunter = PyHunter('my_hunter_api_key')```You can search all the email adresses for a given domain:```pythonhunter.domain_search('instagram.com')```You can also pass the company name, along with optional parameters:```pythonhunter.domain_search(company='Instragram', limit=5, offset=2, emails_type='personal')```You can find a specific email adress:```pythonemail, confidence_score = hunter.email_finder('instragram.com', first_name='Kevin', last_name='Systrom')```You can also use the company name and the full name instead, along with raw to get the full response:```pythonhunter.email_finder(company='Instragram', full_name='Kevin Systrom', raw=True)```You can check the deliverability of a given email adress:```pythonhunter.email_verifier('kevin@instagram.com')```You can check how many email addresses Hunter has for a given domain:```pythonhunter.email_count('instagram.com')```You can also use a company name if the domain is unknown::```pythonhunter.email_count(company='Instagram')```When both domain and company are passed, the domain will be used:```pythonhunter.email_count(domain='instagram.com', company='Instagram')```And you can finally check your account information (PyHunter adds the number of calls still available in the payload):```pythonhunter.account_information()```**NOTE:** By default, all of the calls (except `email_verifier()`) return the 'data' elementof the JSON response. You can get the &quot;raw&quot; response by passing `raw=True` to those calls.This gives access to the response headers, e.g. `X-RateLimit-Remaining` returned for the`domain_search()` call, and also the complete response body, including `meta`.### But that's not all folks! As the v2 API added Leads and Leads Lists, these methods are also available on PyHunter#### Leads methodsYou can get all your leads:```pythonhunter.get_leads()```Or filter the leads you want using these arguments:```pythonhunter.get_leads(offset=2, limit=10, lead_list_id=1, first_name='Kevin', last_name='Systrom', email='kevin@instragram.com', company='Instagram', phone_number=0102030405, twitter='kevin')```You can also get a specific lead by giving its id:```pythonhunter.get_lead(42)```You can create a lead:```pythonhunter.create_lead('Quentin', 'Durantay', email='quentin.durantay@unicorn.io', position='CEO', company='Unicorn Consulting', company_size=10, confidence_score=100, website='unicornsaregreat.io', contry_code='FR', postal_code=75000, source='theinternet.com', linkedin_url='www.linkedin.com/in/masteroftheuniverse', phone_number=0102030405, twitter='quentindty', leads_list_id=1)```You can update a lead by giving its id and the parameters to change (same as creation):```pythonhunter.update_lead(1, position='CEO in chief')```And you can also delete a lead by giving its id:```pythonhunter.delete_lead(42)```#### Leads Lists methodsYou can get all your Leads Lists:```pythonhunter.get_leads_lists()```And filter the results with these arguments:```pythonhunter.get_leads_lists(offset=3, limit=2)```You can get a specific Leads List by giving its id:```pythonhunter.get_leads_list(42)```You can create a Leads Lists:```pythonhunter.create_leads_list('Ultra hot prospects', team_id=1)```You can update a Leads List by giving its id:```pythonhunter.update_leads_list(42, 'Ultra mega hot prospects', team_id=2)```And you can finally delete a Leads Lists by giving its id:```pythonhunter.delete_leads_list(42)```### InformationThis library is still in development, don't hesitate to share bugs if you find some (nomally it's good, but you never know :p ).### ContributeIt's my first (ever) open-source library! So it can be improved. Feel very welcome to fork it and ask for pull requests if you find something buggy or lacking ;)### Have a nice day scraping B2B emails with PyHunter!</longdescription>

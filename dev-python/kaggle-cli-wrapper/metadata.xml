	<longdescription>### IntroductionThe repository adds simple class for adding a wrapper on top of kaggle cli tools for ease of downloading competition datasets, listing competitions, downloading and un-zipping datasets.It aims to make it easy to use kaggle datasets directly from python scripts.  It's main usecase is to be used as a submodule in other repos/ or used as a standalone package. If the library is used as a standalone package - the data is downloaded and stored in data folder. In case of using the package as a submodule - the data is downloaded in a data folder created in the base folder of the calling script. ### InstallationThe repo relies on setuptools and kaggle library packages. To install the repo please use one of the following options:```bashpip install -U kaggle setuptoolspython setup.py install```It also assumes that presence of Kaggle User ID and public API credentials at ```On Windows: C:\Users\&lt;Windows-username&gt;\.kaggle\kaggle.jsonOthers: ~/. kaggle/kaggle.json```After the above steps: the repo can be installed from git using:```pip install git+https://github.com/sunny1401/kaggle_utils.git#egg=kaggle-cli-wrapper```The project can also be installed using pip:```pip install kaggle-cli-wrapper```## Code details### DataAPI class#### To list all available datasets```pythonfrom kaggle_cli_wrapper import KaggleDataApikda = KaggleDataApi(call_path=__file__)kda.list_all_kaggle_datasets(search_term=&quot;cityscapes&quot;)```The call_path argument is required to decide the folder where downloaded files are stored.The function would return all available datasets with cityscape. This would also be saved as a .txt file. Currently the list is sorted by &quot;votes&quot;.To change this sorting please use the argument ```sort_by```. Allowed values of sort by are: ```python'hottest', 'votes', 'updated', 'active', 'published'```#### To list all available competition datasets```pythonfrom kaggle_cli_wrapper import KaggleDataApikda = KaggleDataApi(call_path=__file__)kda.list_all_kaggle_competitions(search_term=&quot;cityscapes&quot;)```Currently the list is sorted by &quot;earliestDeadline&quot;.To change this sorting please use the argument ```sort_by```. Allowed values of sort by are: ```python'grouped', 'prize', 'earliestDeadline','latestDeadline', 'numberOfTeams', 'recentlyCreated'```#### To download datasets```pythonfrom kaggle_cli_wrapper import KaggleDataApikda = KaggleDataApi(call_path=__file__)kda.download_kaggle_dataset(dataset_name=&quot;cityscapes_train_val_test&quot;, is_competition_dataset=False)```To download a competition dataset, is_competition_dataset needs to be set to True### ScoringAPIThe code currently supports minimum functionality for submission of files to a competition and getting scores for the competition#### To submit to a competition```pythonfrom kaggle_utils.kaggle_cli_wrapper import KaggleScoringsApikaggle_scoring_api = KaggleScoringsApi(competition_name=&quot;facial-keypoints-detection&quot;)kaggle_scoring_api.submit_solution(submissions_file=submission_path, description=&quot;facial_keypoint_vanilla_cnn&quot;)kaggle_scoring_api.get_top_scores()```## Remaining Issues- improve error handling - allow for saving of stdout</longdescription>

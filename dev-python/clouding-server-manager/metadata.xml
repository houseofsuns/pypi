	<longdescription># Clouding Server Manager![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-1.0.5-brightgreen.svg)![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.9-brightgreen.svg)![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)Clouding Server Manager is a Python project that allows you to manage your Clouding servers from the command line. It is designed to list, archive, and unarchive servers in your Clouding account. It uses the [Clouding API](https://api.clouding.io/docs) to perform the actions.## Table of Contents* [Features](#features)* [Examples](#examples)* [Installation with Poetry (recommended)](#installation-with-poetry-recommended)* [Installation with pip](#installation-with-pip)* [Installation as a PyPI package](#installation-as-a-pypi-package)* [Development Setup](#development-setup)* [Contributing](#contributing)* [License](#license)## Features* Simple and easy to use command line interface.* List all the information about your Clouding servers and filter their fields so that you can see only the information you want.* Archive one or multiple servers at once.* Unarchive one or multiple servers at once.## ExamplesThese are just a few examples of how to use the script. For more information, check out the help message by running `python -m clouding_server_manager --help`.* List all servers:    ```bash    python -m clouding_server_manager list -t all    ```* List all servers and filter their fields:    ```bash    python -m clouding_server_manager list -t all --f id -f name    ```* Archive a server:    ```bash    python -m clouding_server_manager archive -t 123456    ```* Archive multiple servers:    ```bash    python -m clouding_server_manager archive -t 123456 -t 789012    ```* Unarchive a server:    ```bash    python -m clouding_server_manager unarchive -t 123456    ```* Unarchive multiple servers:    ```bash    python -m clouding_server_manager unarchive -t 123456 -t 789012    ```## Installation with Poetry (recommended)To set up the project, follow these steps:1. Make sure you have [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer) installed in your system.2. It is highly recommended to set this Poetry configuration parameters to avoid multiple issues:    ```bash    poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true    poetry config virtualenvs.prefer-active-python true    ```3. Clone the repository:    ```bash    git clone https://github.com/dmarts05/clouding-server-manager    ```4. Navigate to the project directory:    ```bash    cd clouding-server-manager    ```5. Install the project dependencies using Poetry:    ```bash    poetry install    ```    You might need [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to install the Python version specified in the `pyproject.toml` file. If that's the case, run `pyenv install 3.9` before running the previous command. Also, check out the [Poetry documentation about pyenv](https://python-poetry.org/docs/managing-environments/) for more information.6. Activate the virtual environment:    ```bash    poetry shell    ```    This will activate the virtual environment so that you can run the script.7. Enter your Clouding API key in the `.env` file. Check out `.env.sample` for an example. You can find your Clouding API key in the API section of your Clouding account (as of now you need access to the beta version of the Clouding API). As an alternative, you can use --api-key or -k to specify your API key when running the script.8. Run the script:    ```bash    python -m clouding_server_manager --help    ```    or    ```bash    poetry run clouding-sm --help    ```    This will display the help message and show you how to use the script.## Installation with pipThis is an alternative installation method that uses pip instead of Poetry. It might not work as expected, so it is recommended to use the Poetry installation method instead. To set up the project, follow these steps:1. Clone the repository:    ```bash    git clone https://github.com/dmarts05/clouding-server-manager    ```2. Navigate to the project directory:    ```bash    cd clouding-server-manager    ```3. Install the project dependencies using pip:    ```bash    pip install -r requirements.txt    ```    You might need [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to install the Python version specified in the `requirements.txt` file.4. Enter your Clouding API key in the `.env` file. Check out `.env.sample` for an example. You can find your Clouding API key in the API section of your Clouding account (as of now you need access to the beta version of the Clouding API). As an alternative, you can use --api-key or -k to specify your API key when running the script.5. Run the script:    ```bash    python -m clouding_server_manager --help    ```    or    ```bash    poetry run clouding-sm --help    ```    This will display the help message and show you how to use the script.## Installation as a PyPI packageThis is an alternative installation method that uses pip to install the package from PyPI. It might not work as expected, so it is recommended to use the Poetry installation method instead. To set up the project, follow these steps:1. Install the package using pip:    ```bash    pip install clouding-server-manager    ```2. Configure the environment variable with `export` or by adding them to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:    ```bash    export CLOUDING_API_KEY=&quot;YOUR API KEY&quot;    ```    You can find your Clouding API key in the API section of your Clouding account (as of now you need access to the beta version of the Clouding API). As an alternative, you can use --api-key or -k to specify your API key when running the script.2. Run the script:    ```bash    clouding-sm --help    ```    This will display the help message and show you how to use the script.## Development SetupIf you want to contribute to the project or run the development environment, follow these additional steps:1. Install the development dependencies:    ```bash    poetry install --with dev    ```2. Install pre-commit hooks:    ```bash    poetry run pre-commit install    ```3. Format the code:    ```bash    poetry run black clouding_server_manager    ```4. Lint the code:    ```bash    poetry run flake8 clouding_server_manager    ```5. Run static type checking:    ```bash    poetry run mypy clouding_server_manager    ```6. Generate the documentation:    ```bash    cd docs &amp;&amp; poetry run make html    ```7. Do everything at once (except for generating the documentation):    ```bash    poetry run pre-commit run --all-files    ```That's it! You now have the project set up and ready for development or execution.## ContributingPull requests are welcome.

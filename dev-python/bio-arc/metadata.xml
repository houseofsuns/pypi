	<longdescription># ARC (Antigen Receptor Classifier)### Authors: Austin Crinklaw, Swapnil Mahajan## Requirements:- Linux OS- [HMMER3](http://hmmer.org/)- NCBI Blast+- Python 3+  - Python packages: Pandas, BioPython## Installation:We provide a Dockerfile for ease of use.ARC can also be downloaded through PyPI using the following pip command.```shellpip install bio-arc```### Testing Installation:A quick check for proper dependencies and successful installation can be performed by navigating to your pip package install directory (which can be located by executing ```pip show bio-arc```) and running the following command:```shellpython3 -m arc_test```Passing all unit-tests means that your system is configured properly and ready to classify some protein sequences.## Usage:### Input  -  A fasta format file with one or more protein sequences.    ```  &gt;1WBZ_A_alpha I H2-KbMVPCTLLLLLAAALAPTQTRAGPHSLRYFVTAVSRPGLGEPRYMEVGYVDDTEFVRFDSDAENPRYEPRARWMEQEGPEYWERETQKAKGNEQSFRVDLRTLLGYYNQSKGGSHTIQVISGCEVGSDGRLLRGYQQYAYDGCDYIALNEDLKTWTAADMAALITKHKWEQAGEAERLRAYLEGTCVEWLRRYLKNGNATLLRTDSPKAHVTHHSRPEDKVTLRCWALGFYPADITLTWQLNGEELIQDMELVETRPAGDGTFQKWASVVVPLGKEQYYTCHVYHQGLPEPLTLRWEPPPSTVSNMATVAVLVVLGAAIVTGAVVAFVMKMRRRNTGGKGGDYALAPGSQTSDLSLPDCKVMVHDPHSLA&gt;1WBZ_B_b2m I H2-KbMARSVTLVFLVLVSLTGLYAIQKTPQIQVYSRHPPENGKPNILNCYVTQFHPPHIEIQMLKNGKKIPKVEMSDMSFSKDWSFYILAHTEFTPTETDTYACRVKHASMAEPKTVYWDRDM  ```### Commands-  Using Fasta file as an input:```shellpython -m ARC classify -i /path/to/input.fasta -o /path/to/output.csv```### Output  -  Output file has 4 columns in CSV format. -  First column named 'ID' is the description provoded in the fasta for each sequence.  -  Second column named 'class' is the assigned molecule class for each sequence.   -  e.g. MHC-I, MHC-II, BCR or TCR.  -  The third column named 'chain_type' is the assigned chain type for each sequence.   -  e.g. alpha, beta, heavy, lambda, kappa, scFv, TscFv or construct. These will also be labelled as V for variable domain or C for constant domain.-  The fourth column named 'calc_mhc_allele' is the MHC allele identified using groove domain similarity to MRO alleles.| ID                                  | class  | chain_type | calc_mhc_allele||---------------------------------------- |------- |----------- |---------------|| 1WBY_A_alpha I H2-Db                    |MHC-I  | alpha V     | || 1WBY_B_b2m I H2-Db                  |       |            | || 1HQR_A_alpha II HLA-DRA*01:01/DRB5*01:01|MHC-II | alpha C     | HLA-DRA*01:01 || 1HQR_B_beta II HLA-DRA*01:01/DRB5*01:01 |MHC-II | beta C     | HLA-DRB5*01:01 || 2CMR_H_heavy                            |BCR   | heavy V      | || 2CMR_L_light                            |BCR   | kappa C     | || 4RFO_L_light                            |BCR   | lambda V    | || 3UZE_A_heavy                            |BCR   | scFv       | || 1FYT_D_alpha                            |TCR   | alpha V     | || 1FYT_E_beta                             | TCR   | beta C      | || 3TF7_C_alpha                            |TCR    | TscFv      | |## How it works:- BCR and TCR chains are identified using HMMs. A given protein sequence is searched against HMMs built using BCR and TCR chain sequences from IMGT. HMMER is used to align an input sequence to the HMMs.- MHC class I (alpha1-alpha2 domains) and MHC class I alpha and beta chain HMMs are downloaded from Pfam website. An input protein sequence is searched against these HMMs. A HMMER bit score threshold of 25 was used to identify MHC chain sequences.- To identify MHC alleles, groove domains (G-domains) are assigned based on the MRO repository. - IgNAR sequences are identified through querying against a custom blast database.## References:Several methods for HMMER result parsing were sourced from ANARCI.[Dunbar J and Deane CM.

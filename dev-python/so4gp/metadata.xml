	<longdescription>**SO4GP** stands for: &quot;Some Optimizations for Gradual Patterns&quot;. SO4GP applies optimizations such as swarm intelligence, HDF5 chunks, cluster analysis and many others in order to improve the efficiency of extracting gradual patterns. It provides Python algorithm implementations for these optimization techniques. The algorithm implementations include:* (Classical) GRAANK algorithm for extracting GPs* Ant Colony Optimization algorithm for extracting GPs* Genetic Algorithm for extracting GPs* Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm for extracting GPs* Random Search algorithm for extracting GPs* Local Search algorithm for extracting GPs* Clustering-based algorithm for extracting GPsA GP (Gradual Pattern) is a set of gradual items (GI) and its quality is measured by its computed support value. For example given a data set with 3 columns (age, salary, cars) and 10 objects. A GP may take the form: {age+, salary-} with a support of 0.8. This implies that 8 out of 10 objects have the values of column age 'increasing' and column 'salary' decreasing.## Install RequirementsBefore running **so4gp**, make sure you install the following ```Python Packages```:```shellpip3 install numpy&gt;=1.23.2 pandas&gt;=1.4.4 python-dateutil&gt;=2.8.2 ypstruct&gt;=0.0.2 scikit-learn&gt;=1.1.2```## UsageIn order to run each algorithm for the purpose of extracting GPs, follow the instructions that follow.First and foremost, import the **so4gp** python package via:```pythonimport so4gp as sgp```### 1.  GRAdual rANKing Algorithm for GPs (GRAANK)This is the classical approach (initially proposed by Anne Laurent) for mining gradual patterns. All the remaining algorithms are variants of this algorithm.```pythonmine_obj = sgp.GRAANK(data_source=f_path, min_sup=0.5, eq=False)gp_json = mine_obj.discover()print(gp_json)```where you specify the parameters as follows:* **data_src** - *[required]* data source {either a ```file in csv format``` or a ```Pandas DataFrame```}* **min_sup** - *[optional]* minimum support ```default = 0.5```* **eq** - *[optional]* encode equal values as gradual ```default = False```### 2. Ant Colony Optimization for GPs (ACO-GRAANK)In this approach, it is assumed that every column can be converted into gradual item (GI). If the GI is valid (i.e. its computed support is greater than the minimum support threshold) then it is either increasing or decreasing (+ or -), otherwise it is irrelevant (x). Therefore, a pheromone matrix is built using the number of columns and the possible variations (increasing, decreasing, irrelevant) or (+, -, x). The algorithm starts by randomly generating GP candidates using the pheromone matrix, each candidate is validated by confirming that its computed support is greater or equal to the minimum support threshold. The valid GPs are used to update the pheromone levels and better candidates are generated.```pythonmine_obj = sgp.AntGRAANK(data_src)gp_json = mine_obj.discover()print(gp_json)```where you specify the parameters as follows:* **data_src** - *[required]* data source {either a ```file in csv format``` or a ```Pandas DataFrame```}* **min_sup** - *[optional]* minimum support ```default = 0.5```* **max_iteration** - *[optional]* maximum number of iterations ```default = 1```* **evaporation_factor** - *[optional]* evaporation factor ```default = 0.5```### 3. Genetic Algorithm for GPs (GA-GRAANK)In this approach, it is assumed that every GP candidate may be represented as a binary gene (or individual) that has a unique position and cost. The cost is derived from the computed support of that candidate, the higher the support value the lower the cost. The aim of the algorithm is search through a population of individuals (or candidates) and find those with the lowest cost as efficiently as possible.```pythonmine_obj = sgp.GeneticGRAANK(data_src)gp_json = mine_obj.discover()print(gp_json)```where you specify the parameters as follows:* **data_src** - *[required]* data source {either a ```file in csv format``` or a ```Pandas DataFrame```}* **min_sup** - *[optional]* minimum support ```default = 0.5```* **max_iteration** - *[optional]* maximum number of algorithm iterations ```default = 1```* **n_pop** - *[optional]* initial population ```default = 5```* **pc** - *[optional]* offspring population multiple ```default = 0.5```* **gamma** - *[optional]* crossover rate ```default = 1```* **mu** - *[optional]* mutation rate ```default = 0.9```* **sigma** - *[optional]* mutation rate ```default = 0.9```### 4. Particle Swarm Optimization for GPs (PSO-GRAANK)In this approach, it is assumed that every GP candidate may be represented as a particle that has a unique position and fitness. The fitness is derived from the computed support of that candidate, the higher the support value the higher the fitness. The aim of the algorithm is search through a population of particles (or candidates) and find those with the highest fitness as efficiently as possible.```pythonmine_obj = sgp.ParticleGRAANK(data_src)gp_json = mine_obj.discover()print(gp_json)```where you specify the parameters as follows:* **data_src** - *[required]* data source {either a ```file in csv format``` or a ```Pandas DataFrame```}* **min_sup** - *[optional]* minimum support ```default = 0.5```* **max_iteration** - *[optional]* maximum number of algorithm iterations ```default = 1```* **n_particles** - *[optional]* initial particle population ```default = 5```* **velocity** - *[optional]* particle velocity ```default = 0.9```* **coeff_p** - *[optional]* personal coefficient rate ```default = 0.01```* **coeff_g** - *[optional]* global coefficient ```default = 0.9```### 5. Local Search for GPs (LS-GRAANK)In this approach, it is assumed that every GP candidate may be represented as a position that has a cost value associated with it. The cost is derived from the computed support of that candidate, the higher the support value the lower the cost. The aim of the algorithm is search through group of positions and find those with the lowest cost as efficiently as possible.```pythonmine_obj = sgp.HillClimbingGRAANK(data_src, min_sup)gp_json = mine_obj.discover()print(gp_json)```where you specify the parameters as follows:* **data_src** - *[required]* data source {either a ```file in csv format``` or a ```Pandas DataFrame```}* **min_sup** - *[optional]* minimum support ```default = 0.5```* **max_iteration** - *[optional]* maximum number of algorithm iterations ```default = 1```* **step_size** - *[optional]* step size ```default = 0.5```### 6. Random Search for GPs (RS-GRAANK)In this approach, it is assumed that every GP candidate may be represented as a position that has a cost value associated with it. The cost is derived from the computed support of that candidate, the higher the support value the lower the cost. The aim of the algorithm is search through group of positions and find those with the lowest cost as efficiently as possible.```pythonimport so4gp as sgpmine_obj = sgp.RandomGRAANK(data_src, min_sup)gp_json = mine_obj.discover()print(gp_json)```where you specify the parameters as follows:* **data_src** - *[required]* data source {either a ```file in csv format``` or a ```Pandas DataFrame```}* **min_sup** - *[optional]* minimum support ```default = 0.5```* **max_iteration** - *[optional]* maximum number of algorithm iterations ```default = 1```### 7. Clustering algorithm for GPs (Clu-BFS)We borrow the net-win concept used in the work 'Clustering Using Pairwise Comparisons' proposed by R. Srikant to the problem of extracting gradual patterns (GPs). In order to mine for GPs, each feature yields 2 gradual items which we use to construct a bitmap matrix comparing each row to each other (i.e., (r1,r2), (r1,r3), (r1,r4), (r2,r3), (r2,r4), (r3,r4)).In this approach, we convert the bitmap matrices into 'net-win vectors'. Finally, we apply spectral clustering to determine which gradual items belong to the same group based on the similarity of net-win vectors. Gradual items in the same cluster should have almost similar score vector.```pythonimport so4gp as sgpmine_obj = sgp.ClusterGP(data_source=data_src, min_sup=0.5, e_prob=0.1)gp_json = mine_obj.discover()print(gp_json)```where you specify the parameters as follows:* **data_src** - *[required]* data source {either a ```file in csv format``` or a ```Pandas DataFrame```}* **min_sup** - *[optional]* minimum support ```default = 0.5```* **e_probability** - *[optional]* erasure probability ```default = 0.5```* **max_iteration** - *[optional]* maximum iterations for estimating score vectors ```default = 10```## Sample OutputThe default output is the format of JSON:```json{&quot;Algorithm&quot;: &quot;RS-GRAANK&quot;,&quot;Best Patterns&quot;: [            [[&quot;Age+&quot;, &quot;Salary+&quot;], 0.6],             [[&quot;Expenses-&quot;, &quot;Age+&quot;, &quot;Salary+&quot;], 0.6]],&quot;Iterations&quot;: 20}```### References* Owuor, D., Runkler T., Laurent A., Menya E., Orero J (2021), Ant Colony Optimization for Mining Gradual Patterns.

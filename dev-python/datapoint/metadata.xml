	<longdescription>Datapoint for Python--------------------*A Python module for accessing weather data via the MetOffice's open data API known as`Datapoint`.***Disclaimer: This module is in no way part of the datapointproject/service. This module is intended to simplify the use ofDatapoint for small Python projects (e.g school projects). No supportfor this module is provided by the Met Office and may break as theDatapoint service grows/evolves. The author will make reasonable effortsto keep it up to date and fully featured.**Changelog---------+ Explicitly state the use of semantic versioning in `README.md`.+ Add `elements()` function to `Timestep`.+ Remove night/day indication from weather codes which have them.+ Change the logic used to calculate the closest timestep to a datetime. The closest timestep to the datetime is now used. Add a new function, `Forecast.at_datetime(target)` to do this. `Forecast.now()` has been changed to use this new function. The old behaviour is deprecated and available using `Forecast.now_old()`. `Forecast.future()` has been changed to use this new function. The old behaviour is deprecated and available using `Forecast.future_old()`.+ Check if keys are returned from datapoint api in `Manager.py`. Do not attempt to read the values from the dict if they are not there.Installation------------.. code:: bash    $ pip install datapointYou will also require a `Datapoint API`key from http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/datapoint/API.Features---------  List forecast sites-  Get nearest forecast site from latitiude and longitude-  Get the following 5 day forecast types for any site-  Daily (Two timesteps, midday and midnight UTC)-  3 hourly (Eight timesteps, every 3 hours starting at midnight UTC)-  Get observation sites-  Get observations for any siteContributing changes--------------------Please feel free to submit issues and pull requests.License-------GPLv3.</longdescription>

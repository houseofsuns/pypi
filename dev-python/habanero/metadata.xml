	<longdescription>habanero========|pypi| |docs| |ghactions| |coverage| |black|This is a low level client for working with Crossref's search API. It's been named to be more generic, as other organizations are/will adopt Crossref's search API, making it possible to interact with all from one client.`Crossref API docs &lt;https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc&gt;`__Other Crossref API clients:- Ruby: `serrano`, `&lt;https://github.com/sckott/serrano&gt;`__Crossref's API issue tracker: https://gitlab.com/crossref/issues`habanero` includes three modules you can import as needed (orimport all):`Crossref` - Crossref search API. The `Crossref` module includes methods matching Crossref API routes, and a few convenience methods for getting DOI agency and random DOIs:- `works` - `/works` route- `members` - `/members` route- `prefixes` - `/prefixes` route- `funders` - `/funders` route- `journals` - `/journals` route- `types` - `/types` route- `licenses` - `/licenses` route- `registration_agency` - get DOI minting agency- `random_dois` - get random set of DOIs`counts` - citation counts. Includes the single `citation_count` method`cn` - content negotiation. Includes the methods:- `content_negotiation` - get citations in a variety of formats- `csl_styles` - get CSL styles, used in `content_negotation` method`WorksContainer` - A class for handling Crossref works. Pass output of works from methods on the `Crossref` class to more easily extract specific fields of works. Note about searching:You are using the Crossref search API described at https://api.crossref.org/swagger-ui/index.html. When you search with query terms, on Crossref servers they are not searching full text, or even abstracts of articles, but only what is available in the data that is returned to you. That is, they search article titles, authors, etc. For some discussion on this, see https://gitlab.com/crossref/issues/-/issues/101Rate limits-----------See the headers `X-Rate-Limit-Limit` and `X-Rate-Limit-Interval` for current rate limits.The Polite Pool---------------To get in the polite pool it's a good idea now to include a `mailto` emailaddress.

See the new docs for better information on types (#70)* fixed problem with usage of `warn=True`; in a for loop, an internal variable `warning_thrown` wasn't being reset after each loop iteration, with the result that all objects returned after a warning was thrown were `None` regardless of the actual result. sorry about that!  (#112) (#113)1.2.2 (2022-05-19)--------------------* Fixed class `WorksContainer` to work with cursor output of works results (e.g., `cr.works(query, cursor=&quot;*&quot;)`) (#106) thanks @IvanSterligov1.2 (2022-03-27)--------------------* Added class `WorksContainer` to make handling works data easier (#101)* changed master branch to main in github development repository (#103)* exclude tests from install (#105)1.0 (2021-11-12)--------------------* fixes to docs/contributing.rst and package level docs for habanero (#89) (#90) thanks @Daniel-Mietchen !* fix limit and offset internal handling for `request` and `Request` (#91) thanks @Bubblbu !* `content_negotation` throws warning now on 4xx/5xx status code to allow for bad DOIs alongside good DOIS (#92)* add example to README for querying `works` by DOI (#93)* fail better when json is not returned; try json.loads and catch ValueError (JSONDecodeError is a subclass of ValueError) (#97)* funders, journals, members, prefixes, types and works gain `warn` parameter to optionally throw a warning instead of error if a DOI is not found - not found DOI with `warn=True` returns `None` (#69)0.7.4 (2020-05-29)--------------------* `query.title` filter is deprecated, use `query.bibliographic` instead (#85)0.7.2 (2019-12-12)--------------------* `Crossref()` class gains `ua_string` option to add an additional string to the user-agent sent with every request (#84)0.7.0 (2019-11-08)--------------------* `filter_names()` and `filter_details()` altered to get metadata for works, members and funders filters; and added egs to members and funders methods for using filters (#67)* many typos fixed (#80) thanks @Radcliffe !* use of a progress bar is now possible when fetching works route data, only when doing deep paging, see `progress_bar` parameter (#77) (#82)* `content_negotiation` fixes: `ids` parameter is now required (has no default), and must be a str or list of str (#83)* no longer testing under Python 20.6.2 (2018-10-22)--------------------* changelog was missing from the pypi distribution, fixed now (#71)* fixed `Crossref.registration_agency()` method, borked it up on a previous change (#72)* set encoding on response text for `content_negotiation()` method to UTF-8 to fix encoding issues (#73)* fix `Crossref.filter_names()` method; no sort on `dict_keys` (#76)0.6.0 (2017-10-20)--------------------* Added verification and docs for additional Crossref search filters (#62)* Big improvement to docs on readthedocs (#59)* Added `mailto` support (#68) (#63) and related added docs about polite pool (#66)* Added support for `select` parameter (#65)* Added all new `/works` route filters, and simplified filter option handling within library (#60)0.5.0 (2017-07-20)--------------------* Now using `vcrpy` to mock all unit tests (#54)* Can now set your own base URL for content negotation (#37)* Some field queries with `works()` were failing, but now seem to be working, likely due to fixes in Crossref API (#53)* style input to `content_negotiation` was fixed (#57) (#58) thanks @talbertc-usgs* Fix to `content_negotiation` when inputting a DOI as a unicode string (#56)0.3.0 (2017-05-21)--------------------* Added more documentation for field queries, describing available fields that support field queries, and how to do field queries (#50)* `sample` parameter maximum value is 100 - has been for a while, but wasn't updated in Crossref docs (#44)* Updated docs that `facet` parameter can be a string query in addition to a boolean (#49)* Documented new 10,000 max value for `/works` requests - that is, for the `offset` parameter - if you need more results than that use `cursor` (see https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc/blob/master/rest_api.md#deep-paging-with-cursors) (#47)* Added to docs a bit about rate limiting, their current values, that they can change, and how to show them in verbose curl responses (#45)* Now using `https://doi.org` for `cn.content_negotation` - and function gains new parameter `url` to  specify different base URLs for content negotiation (#36)* Fixes to kwargs and fix docs for what can be passed to kwargs  (#41)* Duplicated names passed to `filter` were not working - fixed now (#48)* Raise proper HTTP errors when appropriate for `cn.content_negotiation` thanks @jmaupetit (#55)0.2.6 (2016-06-24)--------------------* fixed problem with `cr.works()` where DOIs passed weren't making the correct API request to Crossref (#40)* added support for field queries to all methods that support `/works` (&lt;https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc/blob/master/rest_api.md#field-queries&gt;) (#38)0.2.2 (2016-03-09)--------------------* fixed some example code that included non-working examples (#34)* fixed bug in `registration_agency()` method, works now!

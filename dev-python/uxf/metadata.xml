	<longdescription># Python UXF LibraryUniform eXchange Format (UXF) is a plain text human readable optionallytyped storage format that supports custom types.UXF is designed to make life easier for software developers and datadesigners. It directly competes with csv, ini, json, toml, and yaml formats.A key advantage of UXF is its support for custom (i.e., user-defined) types.This can result in more compact, more readable, and easier to parse data.And in some contexts it may prove to be a convenient alternative to sqliteor xml.For details of the Uniform eXchange Format (UXF) supported by this library,see the [UXF Overview](../README.md). ([PyPI link to UXFOverview](https://github.com/mark-summerfield/uxf/blob/main/README.md).)- [Introduction](#introduction)- [Python UXF Types](#python-uxf-types)- [API](#api)    - [Reading and Writing UXF Data](#reading-and-writing-uxf-data)    - [API Notes](#api-notes)    - [Feedback](#feedback)    - [Classes](#classes)    - [Functions](#functions)    - [Constants](#constants)    - [Command Line Usage](#command-line-usage)- [Changes](#changes)## IntroductionThe Python `uxf` library works out of the box with the standard library andone dependency,[editabletuple](https://github.com/mark-summerfield/editabletuple). Itrequires Python 3.8 or later.- Install: `python3 -m pip install uxf` (or download the wheel `.whl`  files and do `python -m pip install uxf....whl  editabletuple...whl` where ... varies)- Run: `python3 -m uxf -h` _# this shows the command line help_- Use: `import uxf` _# see the `uxf.py` module docs and [API](#api) for the API_Using `uxf` as an executable (e.g., `python3 -m uxf ...`) provides a meansof doing `.uxf` to `.uxf` conversions (e.g., compress or uncompress or touse the standard pretty print format). The executable can also be used forlinting, for deleting unused _ttypes_, and for replacing imports to ensurethat UXF files are stand-alone.Installed alongside `uxf.py` are: `uxfconvert.py`, `uxfcompare.py`, and`uxflint.py`. For example, `uxfconvert.py` can losslessly convert `.uxf` to`.json` or `.xml` and back. It can also do some simple conversions to andfrom `.csv`, to `.ini`, and to and from `.sqlite`, but these are really toillustrate use of the `uxf.py` APIs. `uxfcompare.py` can compare two UXFfiles, either for equality, i.e., they both contain the same data, withlists and tables compared value by value in order, and maps compared by itemin key-order, or for equivalence. A UXF file can be linted using `python3 -muxf -l file.uxf`; but to lint any number of files, use `uxflint.py`.Also see the UXF test files in the `../testdata` folder, the Python examplesin the `py/eg` folder, and the Python tests in the `py/t` folder.If you just want to create a small standalone `.pyz`, you could simply copy`uxf.py` and `editabletuple.py` into your project folder and include them inyour `.pyz` file.## Python UXF TypesMost Python types convert losslessly to and from UXF types. In particular:|**Python Type**     |**UXF type**|**Notes**||--------------------|------------|---------||`None`              | `null`     |||`bool`              | `bool`     |||`bytes`             | `bytes`    |||`bytearray`         | `bytes`    |Lossless conversion but type changes to Python `bytes`||`datetime.date`     | `date`     |||`datetime.datetime` | `datetime` |Loses any timezone and only preserves to the nearest 1-second||`int`               | `int`      |||`float`             | `real`     |||`str`               | `str`      |||`uxf.List`          | `list`     |||`uxf.Map`           | `map`      |||`uxf.Table`         | `table    `||A [List](#list-class) is a Python `collections.UserList` subclass with`.data` (the list)`, .comment` and `.vtype` attributes. A `.vtype` holds a`str` representing the name of the corresponding UXF type (e.g., `int`,`real`, etc.) or a `ttype` (the name of a custom table type; see[TClass](#tclass-class)). If a `.vtype` is `None` it means that _any_ UXFtype may be stored.Similarly a [Map](#map-class) is a Python `collections.UserDict` subclasswith `.data` (the dict), `.comment`, `.ktype`, and `.vtype` attributes. The`.ktype` is a `str` like the `.vtype` except that it may only be `None`(accept any valid _ktype_) or one of `bytes`, `date`, `datetime`, `int`, or`str`. The `.vtype` works just the same as for [List](#list-class)s.The [Table](#table-class) class has `.records`, `.comment`, and `.tclass`attributes; with `.tclass` holding a [TClass](#tclass-class) which in turnholds the table's `ttype` (i.e., its table type name), and the table's fieldnames and (optional) types. In all cases a type of `None` signifies that anytype valid for the context may be used.Custom types can be represented using _ttypes_. For example, for points youcould define a _ttype_ such as: `=point x:real y:real`. Then you couldinclude single points like `(point 1.5 7.2)`, or many of them such as`(point 1.5 7.2 8.3 -9.4 14.8 0.6)`.Collection types such as `set`, `frozenset`, `tuple`, or `collections.deque`are automatically converted to a [List](#list-class) when they areencountered. Of course, these are one way conversions.## APIThe simplest part of the API loads and saves (dumps) UXF data from/tostrings or files.### Reading and Writing UXF Data    load(filename_or_filelike): -&gt; uxo    loads(uxt): -&gt; uxoThe [load()](#load-def) function reads UXF data from a file or file-likeobject, and the [loads()](#loads-def) function reads UXF data from a string.These functions take several optional arguments; see [load()](#load-def) and[loads()](#loads-def). The returned `uxo` (UXF object) is of type[Uxf](#uxf-class).    dump(filename_or_filelike, data)    dumps(data) -&gt; uxtThe [dump()](#dump-def) function writes the data in UXF format to a file orfile-like object, and the [dumps()](#dumps-def) function writes the datainto a string that's then returned (here called `uxt` to indicate UXF text).These functions take several optional arguments; see [dump()](#dump-def) and[dumps()](#dumps-def). The data can be a [Uxf](#uxfclass) object or a single`list`, [List](#list-class), `dict`, [Map](#map-class), or[Table](#table-class).If the data contains values of types that aren't supported by UXF, theycould be transformed in advance (e.g., to a custom table type, a _ttype_).See also the examples in the `py/eg` folder and the tests in the `py/t`folder.### API NotesA [UXF](#uxf-class) object (called a `uxo` in these docs) has a `.value`attribute that is always a [List](#list-class) or [Map](#map-class) or[Table](#table-class). The first two have essentially the same APIs as`list` and `dict` respectively. The [Table](#table-class) API is a littlesimilar to a `list`. Individual records can be accessed (read _and_ updated)using `table[row]`, and individual files using `table[row][column]` or`table[row].fieldname`. For small tables, records can be accessed with the`first`, `second`, `third`, or `fourth` properties. The best way to appendnew records is to use the [Table](#table-class)'s `append()` method.The `uxf` module distinguishes between a _ttype_ (the name of a user-definedtable) and a [TClass](#tclass-class) (the Python class which represents auser-defined table). A [TClass](#tclass-class) has `.ttype` and `.fields`attributes.For reading UXF data it is easiest to iterate, and to do so recursively, ifthe data has nested collections, e.g., using [Uxf.visit()](#uxf.visit-def).The `uxfconvert.py` tool and the `eg/slides2.py` example both showalternative approaches to manual iteration.Note that for imports, if the filename is relative it is searched for in thesame folder as the importing UXF file, and if not found there, in thecurrent folder, and if not there either, in each of the paths in `UXF_PATH`(if any).Note that the `__version__` is the module version (i.e., the version of thisimplementation), while the `VERSION` is the maximum UXF version that thismodule can read (and the UXF version that it writes).### FeedbackSuggestions, comments, and pull requests for this library are welcome.Especially useful would be ideas on how to improve the APIs to improveusability.Also of interest would be code changes that improve speed.The current implementation uses native types where possible and`isinstance()` checks. It would be possible to create a `Value` abstractbase class and subclasses, but even using `__slots__` this would end upmaking the library use more memory, and most likely slower—however, aclassic class-based implementation would be of great interest if it provedthis intuition wrong!### ClassesThe classes are documented in convenience order. Here are alphabeticallyordered links:[Error](#error-class),[Field](#field-class),[Format](#format-class),[List](#list-class),[Map](#map-class),[Table](#table-class),[TClass](#tclass-class),[Uxf](#uxf-class).The classes[Field](#field-class),[List](#list-class),[Map](#map-class),[Table](#table-class),[TClass](#tclass-class), and[Uxf](#uxf-class)all support `str()` (via `__str__()`) which in all cases produces a validUXF fragment. Note though, that this is in compact (not human-friendly)form. For human-friendly UXF use [dumps()](#dumps-def) or[dump()](#dump-def).&lt;a name=&quot;uxf-class&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;#### UxfA `Uxf` object represents a UXF file in memory.The easiest way to obtain a `Uxf` object is to use one of the module-levelfunctions, [load()](#load-def) or [loads()](#loads-def). Of course, you canalso create ``Uxf``s programatically (as shown in many of the examples andtests).##### Constructor**`Uxf(value=None, *, custom='', tclasses=None, comment=None,on_event=on_event)`**The `Uxf` constructor takes an optional `value` (a `list`, `List`, `tuple`,`dict`, `Map`, or `Table`) and optional (by keyword arguments) `custom`string, `tclasses` (a `dict` whose names are _ttypes_ and whose values arethe corresponding [TClass](#tclass-class)es), and `comment` string. You canalso pass a custom [on\_event()](#on_event-def) handler.To create a `Uxf` programmatically (rather than by using, say,[load()](#load-def), you can either create it empty, or with some data andoptionally, some _ttypes_.    value = ... # a list, uxf.List, dict, uxf.Map, or uxf.Table    point_ttype = uxf.TClass('point', (uxf.Field('x', 'real'), uxf.Field('y', 'real')))    uxo = uxf.Uxf(value, tclasses={point_ttype.ttype: point_ttype})An alternative is to do this:    uxo = uxf.loads('uxf 1\n=point x:real y:real\n[]')    uxo.value = value##### Properties**`.value`**A [List](#list-class), [Map](#map-class), or [Table](#table-class). Sincethese classes can nest, a `Uxf` can represent any arbitrary data structure.**`.custom`**An opional `str` used for customizing the file format, i.e., the header textthat follows the initial `uxf 1` on the first line.**`.tclasses`**A possibly empty `dict` where each key is a `ttype` (i.e., the`.tclass.ttype` which is a [TClass](#tclass-class)'s name—a `str`) and eachvalue is a [TClass](#tclass-class) object. See also[tclass()](#uxf.tclass-def).**`.comment`**An optional file-level `str`.**`.imports`**A possibly empty `dict` where each key is a `ttype` and where each value isa `str` holding that type's import text.**`.import_filenames`**A utility property useful for some UXF processors. It yields all the uniqueimport filenames.##### Methods&lt;a name=&quot;Uxf.load-def&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;**`.load(filename_or_filelike, *, on_event=on_event, drop_unused=False, replace_imports=False)`**Convenience method that wraps the module-level [load()](#load-def) function.&lt;a name=&quot;Uxf.loads-def&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;**`.loads(uxt, filename='-', *, on_event=on_event, drop_unused=False, replace_imports=False)`**Convenience method that wraps the module-level [loads()](#loads-def)function.&lt;a name=&quot;Uxf.dump-def&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;**`.dump(filename_or_filelike, *, on_event=on_event, format=Format())`**Convenience method that wraps the module-level [dump()](#dump-def) function.&lt;a name=&quot;Uxf.dumps-def&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;**`.dumps(*, on_event=on_event, format=Format())`**Convenience method that wraps the module-level [dumps()](#dumps-def)function.&lt;a name=&quot;Uxf.is_equivalent-def&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;**`.is_equivalent(other: Uxf, compare=Compare.EXACT) -&gt; bool`**Method primarily used for regression testing. The [List](#list-class),[Map](#map-class), [Table](#table-class), and [TClass](#tclass-class)classes all provide this method.There are seven comparison flags although normally only `Compare.EQUIVALENT`is used:- ``EXACT`` use `==` or `!=` instead;- ``IGNORE_COMMENTS`` ignore differences in comments- ``IGNORE_UNUSED_TTYPES`` ignore unused ttypes- ``IGNORE_IMPORTS`` ignore whether ttypes are imported or defined- ``EQUIVALENT`` this is the _or_ of the three ignores above- ``IGNORE_KVTYPES`` ignore ktypes, vtypes, and field vtypes (rarely  appropriate)- ``UNTYPED_EQUIVALENT`` this is the _or_ of all the ignores above (rarely  appropriate)For exact equality use `==` or `!=`.&lt;a name=&quot;Uxf.visit-def&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;**`.visit(visitor)`**This method iterates over every value in the Uxf's `value` (recursively) andcalls `visitor(Visit, value)` where Visit is an enum, and value is either aa value or None.Lists, Maps, and Tables also have `visit()` methods (that this methodcalls).&lt;a name=&quot;Uxf.tclass-def&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;**`.tclass(ttype: str) -&gt; bool`**Returns the `TClass` whose _ttype_ is `ttype` or raises `KeyError`.See also the `tclasses` property.&lt;a name=&quot;list-class&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;#### ListA class used to represent a UXF list. It is a `collections.UserList`subclass which holds its list in the `.data` attribute and that also has`.comment` and `.vtype` attributes.Also provides ``is_equivalent()`` and support for `==` and `!=`, as well asa `visit(visitor)` method.##### Constructor**`List(seq=None, *, vtype=None, comment=None)`**The `seq` can be a `list`, `tuple`, or any iterable acceptable to thebuilt-in `list()` type. The _vtype_ is a `str` signifying the type of valuethis list may hold; `None` means values may be of _any_ UXF-compatible type(see [Python UXF Types](#python-uxf-types)). A `str` may be passed as the`comment`. The `vtype` property is immutable after construction.See [Python UXF Types](#python-uxf-types) for more about _vtypes_.&lt;a name=&quot;map-class&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;#### MapA class used to represent a UXF map. It is a `collections.UserDict` subclassthat holds its dict in the `.data` attribute and that also has `.comment`,`.ktype`, and `.vtype` attributes. The `ktype and `vtype` properties areimmutable after construction.Although Python ``dict``s are insertion-ordered, UXF ``Map``s arekey-ordered. To access keys, values, or items in UXF order use theoverridden `keys()`, `values()`, or `items()` methods rather than iteratingdirectly on the map. (The order works as follows: when two keys are ofdifferent types they are ordered `bytes` `&lt;` `date` `&lt;` `datetime` `&lt;` `int``&lt;` `str`, and when two keys have the same types they are ordered using `&lt;`except for ``str``s which use case-insensitive `&lt;`.)Also provides ``is_equivalent()`` and support for `==` and `!=`, as well asa `visit(visitor)` method.##### Constructor**`Map(d=None, *, ktype=None, vtype=None, comment=None)`**The `d` can be a `dict` or any single value acceptable to the built-in`dict()` type. The _ktype_ is a `str` signifying the type of key that mustbe used; `None` means that any valid _ktype_, i.e., `'bytes'`, `'date'`,`'datetime'`, `'int'`, or `'str'`. The _vtype_ is a `str` signifying thetype of value this `Map` may hold; `None` means values may be of _any_UXF-compatible type (see [Python UXF Types](#python-uxf-types)). A `str` maybe passed as the `comment`.See [Python UXF Types](#python-uxf-types) for more about _ktypes_ and_vtypes_.&lt;a name=&quot;table-class&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;#### TableA class used to store UXF Tables.Also provides ``is_equivalent()`` and support for `==` and `!=`, as well asa `visit(visitor)` method.##### Constructor**`Table(tclass=None, *, records=None, comment=None)`**A `Table` can be created using the constructor, passing a[TClass](#tclass-class), and optionally, records (a list of lists, whereeach sublist has `len(tclass.fields)` values), and a comment (a `str`).Alternativvely, use the [table()](#table-def) convenience function whichtakes a _ttype_ (a `str`), and fields. The `tclass` (i.e., the `ttype`)property is immutable after construction.See [Python UXF Types](#python-uxf-types) for more about and _ttypes_.##### Properties**`.tclass`**A [TClass](#tclass-class) which holds the table's _ttype_ and field names(and optional field types). Immutable after construction.**`.ttype`**A convenience for `.tclass.ttype`. Immutable after construction.**`.records`**The table's data: a list of values where each value is either a list with`len(table.fields)` values, or an[editabletuple](https://github.com/mark-summerfield/editabletuple) of type`.RecordClass`.**`.RecordClass`**The table's record class, an[editabletuple](https://github.com/mark-summerfield/editabletuple), whichcan be used to create a single record by calling it with each of therecord's fields' values (or with `*sequence` where `len(sequence)` equalsthe number of fields). When a table record is accessed (e.g., when one rowof the table's list is returned), it is returned as an instance of thisclass.(This is actually a convenience method that returns`table.tclass.RecordClass`.)**`.fields`**A convenience for `.tclass.fields`. Immutable after construction.**`.first`**The table's first record as a `RecordClass`[editabletuple](https://github.com/mark-summerfield/editabletuple), or`None` if the table is empty.**`.second`**The table's second record or `None`.**`.third`**The table's third record or `None`.**`.fourth`**The table's fourth record or `None`.**`.last`**The table's last record or `None`.**`.isfieldless`**This is `True` if the table's `TClass` is fieldless (and is a conveniencefor ``.tclass.isfieldless``).**`.is_scalar`**This is `True` if all the table's values are (or ought to be given itsfields' types) scalars; otherwise it is `False`. Its main use is as a helperfor the [dump()](#dump-def) and [dumps()](#dumps-def) functions.##### Operators**`table[row]`**The table's `row`-th record as a `RecordClass`[editabletuple](https://github.com/mark-summerfield/editabletuple). Thereturned record is editable, so to get or set a field use`table[row][column]` or `table[row].fieldname`.To replace an entire record, use `table[row] = record` where `record` is asequence (e.g., a `tuple` of length `len(table.fields)`), or a`table.RecordClass` instance. (See also `append()` below.)To delete an entire record, use `del table[row]`.**`iter(table)`**For example, `for record in table:`. Yields every record in the table as a`RecordClass` instance.**`len(table)`**The number of records (rows) in the table.##### Methods**`.append(record)`**Appends a new row to the table's list of lists as an [editabletuple](https://github.com/mark-summerfield/editabletuple) of type`.RecordClass`. The row can be provided as a `RecordClass` editabletuple oras a sequence of field values (which will then be converted to the table's`RecordClass`).**`.insert(row, record)`**Inserts the given record (or sequence of field values which is converted toa `RecordClass` instance) into the table at the given `row` position.**`.field(column)`**This function is a convenience for `.tclass.fields[column]`.**`.get(row)`**Returns the table's `row`-th record as a `RecordClass`[editabletuple](https://github.com/mark-summerfield/editabletuple) _or_`None` if `row` is out of range. If a record is returned it is editable.&lt;a name=&quot;tclass-class&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;#### TClassThis class is used to store a [Table](#table-class)'s _ttype_ (i.e., itsname) and fields.Also provides ``is_equivalent()`` and support for `==` and `!=`.##### Constructor**`TClass(ttype, fields=None, *, comment=None)`**The `ttype` must be a `str` that holds the ``TClass``'s name (equivalent toa _vtype_ or _ktype_ name); it may not be the same as a built-in type nameor constant. Leave `fields` as `None` for a fieldless table; otherwise passa sequence of field names (``str``'s) or ``Field``'s (which have field namesand optionally types). The `.comment` may be passed a `str`.The `.ttype` attribute holds the ``TClass``'s name. The `.fields` attributeholds a list of fields of type [Field](#field-class). The `.comment` holdsan optional `str`.The `.isfieldless` property returns `True` if there are no fields (which isvalid for a fieldless table); otherwise returns `False`.The `.RecordClass` property returns an[editabletuple](https://github.com/mark-summerfield/editabletuple), whichcan be used to create a single record by calling it with each of therecord's fields' values (or with `*sequence` where `len(sequence)` equalsthe number of fields).Immutable after construction.&lt;a name=&quot;field-class&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;#### FieldThis class is used to store a [TClass](#tclass-class)'s fields, i.e., thefields for a [Table](#table-class).Also provides support for `==` and `!=`.##### Constructor**`Field(name, vtype=None)`**The `name` must start with a letter and be followed by`0-uxf.MAX_IDENTIFIER_LEN-1` letters, digits, or underscores; it may not bethe same as a built-in type name or constant. A _vtype_ of `None` means thatthe field may hold any valid UXF type (see [Python UXFTypes](#python-uxf-types)); otherwise it must be one of these ``str``s:`'bool'`, `'bytes'`, `'date'`, `'datetime'`, `'int'`, `'real'`, `'list'`,`'map'`, `'str'`, or `'table'`; or a _ttype_ name.Immutable after construction.&lt;a name=&quot;format-class&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;#### FormatThis class is used to specify aspects of the output format for the[dump()](#dump-def) and [dumps()](#dumps-def) functions (and the equivalentmethods).##### Constructor**`Format(indent='  ', wrapwidth=96, realdp=None)`**The [dump()](#dump-def) and [dumps()](#dumps-def) functions use the default`Format()` which uses the defaults shown (indent is two spaces). However, bycreating and passing your own `Format` object, you can change these to suityour needs. For `realdp`, `None` signifies use however many digits after thedecimal point are needed for UXF ``real``'s (i.e., for Python ``float``'s);otherwise specify a value 0-15.For example, if you had a `Uxf` object wanted the output to limit lines to72 characters and to use 3 decimal places for ``real``s, you could pass aformat of `Format(wrapwidth=72, realdp=3)`.&lt;a name=&quot;error-class&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;#### ErrorThis class is used to propagate errors. It holds the `uxf.Event`, an errorcode, an error message string, a filename (or `'-'`), and a line number(`lino` which may be `0`).(If this module produces an exception that isn't a `uxf.Error` or `OSError`subclass then it is probably a bug that should be reported.)### FunctionsThe functions are documented in convenience order. Here are alphabeticallyordered links:[canonicalize()](#canonicalize-def),[dump()](#dump-def),[dumps()](#dumps-def),[event\_text()](#event_text-def),[isoformat()](#isoformat-def),[isasciidigit()](#isasciidigit-def),[is\_scalar()](#is_scalar-def),[load()](#load-def),[loads()](#loads-def),[naturalize()](#naturalize-def),[on\_event()](#on_event-def),[table()](#table-def).&lt;a name=&quot;load-def&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;**`load(filename_or_filelike, *, on_event=on_event, drop_unused=False,replace_imports=False)`**Returns a [Uxf](uxf-class) object.`filename_or_filelike` is `sys.stdin` or a filename (`str` or`pathlib.Path`) or an open readable file (text mode UTF-8 encoded,optionally gzipped).`on_event` is a custom error handling function that defaults to[on\_event](#on_event-def).If `drop_unused` is `True`, then any _ttype_ definitions in the file thataren't actually used in the data are dropped. So if the `Uxf` is laterdumped, the dropped _ttype_ definitions will not be present.If `replace_imports` is `True`, then any imports are replaced by the _ttype_definitions that they import.  So if the `Uxf` is later dumped, _no_ importswill be present; instead any imported _ttypes_ will be dumped as _ttype_definitions. Normally, if you use `replace_imports=True`, then you wouldalso use `drop_unused=True`.&lt;a name=&quot;loads-def&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;**`loads(uxt, filename='-', *, on_event=on_event, drop_unused=False,replace_imports=False)`**Returns a [Uxf](#uxf-class) object.`uxt` must be a `str` of UXF data, e.g., `uxf 1\n[1 2 3]`.If given, the `filename` is used for error messages.For more on the other argument see [load()](#load-def).&lt;a name=&quot;dump-def&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;**`dump(filename_or_filelike, data, *, on_event=on_event,format=Format())`**`filename_or_filelike` is `sys.stdout` or a filename or an open writablefile (text mode UTF-8 encoded).

If `event` is `Event.FATAL` it means the eventis unrecoverable, so the normal action would be to raise. If verbose is`True` the normal action is to print a textual version of the event data to`stderr`.To make `on_event()` quieter:    on_event = functools.partial(uxf.on_event, verbose=False)To make all errors fatal and use your own prefix (rather than the default of`'uxf'`):    def on_event(*args, **kwargs):        kwargs['prefix'] = 'myapp'        raise uxf.Error(uxf.event_text(*args, **kwargs))There are four kinds of events:- `Event.REPAIR` a fix was applied, e.g., an int was converted to a float, a  string containing a date was converted to a date, etc.;- `Event.WARNING` problem can't be automatically fixed but can be coped  with;- `Event.ERROR` problem can't be automatically fixed and means UXF may be  invalid;- `Event.FATAL` unrecoverable problem.For further examples of custom `on_event()` functions, see`t/test_errors.py`, `t/test_imports.py` `t/test_include.py`,`t/test_merge.py`, and `t/test_sqlite.py`.&lt;a name=&quot;event_text-def&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;**`event_text(event, code, message, *, filename='-', lino=0, verbose=True,prefix='uxf')`**Returns a `str` containing the event in ``uxf``'s standard format.

To see the command line helprun:    python3 -m uxf -hor    path/to/uxf.py -h## Changes- 2.8.1 Doc improvements.- 2.8.0 Added `-D|--decimals` to the command line and improved the CLI.- 2.7.0 Minor internal improvements.- 2.6.3 Code improvement. Line numbers for warnings &amp; errors now begin at  the traditional 1.- 2.6.2 Code improvement.- 2.6.1 Max identifier length is now 32 so minimum wrapwidth of 40 is now  always possible; as a result warnings W563 and W564 have been removed.- 2.6.0 Changed `wrap_width` to `wrapwidth` throughout the API. If custom  ``Format``s are used the wrap width name will need to be changed to  `wrapwidth`. Hopefully the last breaking change.- 2.5.8 Subtle line-wrapping bugfix. Changed uxfcompare.py's output.- 2.5.7 Removed redundant code and added more tests.- 2.5.6 uxf.py can now overwrite the infile (e.g., to be used as a formatter  in an editor)- 2.5.2 Minor cleanups and internal improvements.- 2.5.1 Minor internal improvements.- 2.5.0 Switched to new int UXF header version (i.e., `uxf 1` instead of  `uxf 1.0`); hopefully this breaking change won't affect anyone.- 2.4.6 Bugfix: `-c|--compact` now works correctly if output is stdout.- 2.4.5 Tweaked `__str__()` support to output more newlines instead of  spaces—this makes it slightly more human-friendly without increasing the  output size.- 2.4.4 Removed redundant code left over from 2.4.3 plus more docs.- 2.4.3 Added `str()` support for `Field`, `List`, `Map`, `Table`  (improved), `TClass`, and `Uxf` (improved).- 2.4.2 implemented `Uxf.__str__()`.- 2.4.1 Minor improvements and tweaks.- 2.4.0  - `dump()` and `dumps()` now use the pretty printing algorithm which    produces much neater and more consistent output than before. It also    means that `wrap_width` is properly respected even for `bytes` and for    long ``str``s.  - List, Map, and Table comments are no longer immutable.  - The UXF XML format now stores comments as tags rather than attributes to    ensure that whitespace is correctly preserved.- 2.3.1 When ``str``s and `bytes` are output they now respect the  `wrap_width`. The formatting is still unsatisfactory though: a proper  pretty printing algorithm needs to be used.- 2.3.0 Added support for string concatenation. This will make proper pretty  printing possible.- 2.2.0  - Maps are now key-ordered as follows: when two keys are of different    types they are ordered `bytes` `&lt;` `date` `&lt;` `datetime` `&lt;` `int` `&lt;`    `str`, and when two keys have the same types they are ordered using `&lt;`    except for ``str``s which use case-insensitive `&lt;`.  - Added some new methods, in particular `Uxf.visit()` (and `List.visit()`,    `Map.visit()`, and `Table.visit()`), and a new `eg/visit.py` example.- 2.1.0 added `is_equivalent()` and support for `==` (and `!=`) for Lists,  Maps, Tables, and TClasses.- 2.0.1 `on_event()` now supports keyword argument `prefix`.- 2.0.0 API changes  - `on_error()` has been replaced by `on_event()` with a different API.  - ``List``: after construction, the `vtype` and `comment` are immutable;    `data` values remain mutable.  - ``Map``: after construction, the `ktype`, `vtype`, and `comment` are    immutable; `data` items remain mutable.  - ``Table``: after construction, the `tclass` (i.e., the `ttype`) and    `comment` are immutable; `records` remains mutable.  - ``TClass``es are immutable after construction.  - ``Field``s are immutable after construction.  - Internal changes are refactorings and a slightly smarter lexer (and a    correspondingly slightly simpler parser). And, of course, more tests.- 1.1.2 Additional tests.- 1.1.1 Internal improvements plus moved `.RecordClass` to `TClass` (without  changing ``Table``'s API).- 1.1.0 Dropped ``Format``'s `max_fields_in_line` and `max_list_in_line`  settings since neither worked: use `wrap_width` instead.- 1.0.2 Bug fix: I missed a corner case in the previous fix; now fixed.- 1.0.1 Bug fix: when `dump()` and `dumps()` output _ttype_ definitions,  they now respect the format's `wrap_width` and `indent` settings.- 1.0.0 First stable release.---</longdescription>

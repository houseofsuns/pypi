	<longdescription>### What Apollo IsAt [Morgan &amp; Morgan](https://www.forthepeople.com/), the development team builds lots of forms. A lot. While most of theheavy lifting for form management was done for us by the marketing platform, Hubspot, there were some major gaps that forced us to considera switch:1. Cost. Our Hubspot license was &gt; $50,000 yearly where the only utility came from the form management tooling.2. Lack of flexibility. While defining basic validation rules and field layouts was OK, doing anything more complex (e.g. email blacklists, geo-based submission filtering, etc.) was impossible. In fact, since their switch to React renderedforms, [custom validation in a Hubspot form doesn't work at all](https://integrate.hubspot.com/t/integration-with-jquery-validator-customized-validation/1172/9).3. Lack of control. The Hubspot JS library is 300kb+ in size before gzip and sets short-term cache expiration headers. Why? It's hard to say without access to the unminified source.  ![more than 300kb](http://static.forthepeople.com/engineering/apollo/big_hubspot.png)4. Lack of transparency. Hubspot provides Salesforce syncing out of the box. However, having a highly customized Salesforce Org,our Hubspot sync process was anything but straightforward. With these problems in mind, we built **Apollo** as a solution. Apollo is a Django application which - in conjunction with the [Icarus Javascript Library](https://github.com/Morgan-and-Morgan/icarus) -aims to act as a plug-and-play solution for the busy engineer. In addition to providing a management interface for buildingform fields, designing forms, and viewing form submissions, Apollo makes the assumption that it should make no assumptions aboutdomain specific requirements of the host application. Thus, it decouples form management from submission processing,leaving the job of reacting to events within the host. To facilitate this architecture, Apollo opts for a Pub/Sub design, notifying listenerson key events:* _form submitted_* _form submission validated_* _form submission error_See more details on signals in the [signals reference](https://morgan-and-morgan.github.io/apollo/signals)### Why Apollo1. It is - and always will be - free and open source2. Plug-and-play architecture3. Utility in a wide variety of use case4. Integration with native Django permissions, allowing for role assignment when delegating API / form builder access.### Installation```bashpip install django-apollo-forms# add the App to the list of INSTALLED_APPSINSTALLED_APPS = {  ...    'django_filters',  'rest_framework',  'rest_framework_swagger', # optional, creates browsable API docs  'apollo',  ...}# run the migrations to generate DB tablespython manage.py makemigrations apollopython manage.py migrate apollo# collectstatic to generate the static files for the form builder interfacepython manage.py collectstatic```### CustomizationYou can customize the behavior of Apollo by overriding the defaults of the `APOLLO` variable in your settings.py. Beloware the parameters which may be controlled in this setting.| Parameter                 | Default                                                         | Description                                                                       | | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- || BUILDER_ROOT_PREFIX       | &quot;&quot;                                                              | The path at which the Apollo form builder is mounted in the host application      | | BUILDER_REQUIRES_IS_STAFF | True                                                            | If True, then only users with `is_staff` permissions can access the form builder  || DOWNLOAD_REQUIRES_IS_STAFF| True                                                            | If True, then only users with `is_staff` permissions can download form submissions|| API_ROOT                  | /api                                                            | The path to the API root on the server                                            || API_VERSION               | v1                                                              | The Apollo API version                                                            || ICARUS_THEMES_URL         | //static.forthepeople.com/engineering/icarus/v1.0-latest/themes | Location where icarus themes are located                                          || SUBMISSION_EMAIL_FROM     | None                                                            | Email address to send submission notifications from                               || EXTERNAL_HOOKS_SIGNAL_ONLY| True                                                            | If True, then we we do not send webhooks notifications, only trigger a signal     |*Example*```pythonAPOLLO = {    &quot;BUILDER_ROOT_PREFIX&quot;: &quot;/apollo&quot;}```### Features###### Setup field templates for your forms. These define the default configurations for fields and can be overridden on a per-form basis. ![](http://static.forthepeople.com/engineering/apollo/feature_create_field-min.png)---###### Step-by-step form builder interface.![](http://static.forthepeople.com/engineering/apollo/feature_create_form_step_1-min.png)---###### Powerful layout creator with the ability to apply different layouts for desktop and mobile screens.![](http://static.forthepeople.com/engineering/apollo/feature_build_layouts-min.png)---### Form UsageWhen it comes to actually using the forms built by Apollo, you have two options: 1. Use the [Icarus Javascript Library](https://github.com/Morgan-and-Morgan/icarus) (_Recommended_)2. DIY.If you decide to pursue (2), you'll want to consult the Browsable API, mounted at `/&lt;API_ROOT&gt;/&lt;API_VERSION&gt;/docs` for details on authentication, request format,and available resources.### Development#### Getting StartedBringing up a new dev environment should be fairly straightforward. Run `docker-compose up -d` to bring up a complete developmentenvironment.#### Building ReleasesCreate a virtualenv then run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in order to install versioning utilities. Run `bumpversion &lt;SEMVER&gt;`to create a buildable version then push upstream to trigger CI.</longdescription>

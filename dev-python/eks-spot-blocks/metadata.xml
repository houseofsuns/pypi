You have to create the cluster as well as the spot fleet altogether in this construct library.### Can I write the CDK in other languages like `Python` and `Java`?Not at this moment. But we plan to publish this construct with `JSII` so we can install this library via `npm`, `pypi`, `maven` or `nuget`.### How much time can I block the spotfleet?You can block the fleet with hourly increments up to 6 hours.### What happens after the `blockDuration`?Spot Blocks ensure the availability of your spot instances during the `blockDuration` and avoid termination during the price disruption. After the `blockDuration`, by default, your spot instances will still be in `running` state but it doesn't ensure the availability, which means it might be terminated anytime after the `blockDuration`.### Can I terminate the fleet immediately after the `blockDuration` to save the money?Yes. Basically you can configure `validFrom`, `validUntil` and `terminateInstancesWithExpiration` to achieve this.However, consider the following scenario```&lt;deploy start at 1:00&gt;|--------(one hour)-----------------------|&lt;2:00&gt;                           |&lt;fleet created at 1:05&gt;--------(one-hour block)-------|&lt;2:05&gt;```Your fleet will be terminated at `2:00` rather at `2:05`.### Are `tains` and `labels` supported?Yes.(samples TBD)### Does it support AWS China regions?Yes. Including **Beijing**(`cn-north-1`) and **Ningxia**(`cn-northwest-1`).### How much can I save from the EC2 Spot Block compared to the on-demand?According to this [document](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/pricing/?nc1=h_ls)`Spot Instances are also available to run for a predefined duration – in hourly increments up to six hours in length – at a discount of up to 30-50% compared to On-Demand pricing.`### Will this library become part of the upstream `aws-eks` construct library?Probably. As it's still in the preliminary stage, we are still collecting feedbacks from the community to make `eks-spot-blocks` ready for production workloads. Eventually we will commit this feature to the upstream `aws-eks` construct library in AWS CDK through pull requests.</longdescription>

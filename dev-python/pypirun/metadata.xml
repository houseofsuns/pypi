As a result, the package and command must come after the optional arguments.        By default pypirun will run the already installed command from the $PATH in the environment if it is found.  The    --always_install flag will force it to install and run the command.## Examples### Run the serviceping utility from the python serviceping packageThe following will run the command `serviceping -c 1 yahoo.com` from the [serviceping](https://pypi.org/project/serviceping/) package:```consoledhubbard@mac:~$ pypirun serviceping serviceping -c 1 yahoo.comSERVICEPING yahoo.com:80 (72.30.35.10:80).from yahoo.com:80 (72.30.35.10:80): time=65.50 ms                                                                                                                                                                                                                 --- yahoo.com ping statistics ---1 packages transmitted, 1 received, 0.0% package loss, time 73.038msrtt min/avg/max/dev = 65.50/65.50/65.50/0.00 ms```## Screwdriver V4 pypirun commandThe pypirun package publishes a screwdriver v4 shared command called `python/pypirun`.This command will set up python if it is not installed and install and run a the `pypirun` command line utility.The following will run the command `serviceping -c 1 yahoo.com` from the [serviceping](https://pypi.org/project/serviceping/) package using the screwdriver sd-cmd:```sd-cmd python/pypirun@latest serviceping serviceping -c 1 yahoo.com```## ContributePlease refer to [the contributing.md file](Contributing.md) for information about how to get involved.

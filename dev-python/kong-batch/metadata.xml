Normallyyou'd write dedicated submission code for each type of system and use therelevant shell commands to monitor job progress. How do you keep trackof what happened to jobs? How do you even keep track of which job did what?With kong, you can organize your jobs into *folders* (not actual folders on disk),however you feel like it. Kong can keep track of job statuses and reportsthem to you in a clean and organized view. You can manage your jobs in kong, kill them, resubmit them, remove them. Kong also normalizes thingslike where the your job can find scratch space, where to put log filesand where to put output files. This is done by a set of environment variablesavailable in every job, regardless of backend (called *driver*):variable name       | value--------------------|------KONG_JOB_ID         | Kong-specific job ID (not the batch system one)KONG_JOB_OUTPUT_DIR | Where to put output filesKONG_JOB_LOG_DIR    | Where log files goKONG_JOB_NPROC      | How many core your job can useKONG_JOB_SCRATCHDIR | scratch dir for the jobYou can write job scripts that are mostly agnostic to which driver isused to execute the job. Some things remain specific to your environment,especially things that are implemented on top of the actual batch system. Thisincludes things like licenses, queue names, and any other specific configuration.Kong allows you to provide arguments like this either via configuration, or ona job by job basis.## Interface### REPLKong provides a command line like program.

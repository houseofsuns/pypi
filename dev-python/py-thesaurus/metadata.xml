At the core, she was a web scraper. A good one. She helped numerous developers out there to meet the needs on NLP, Text processing and Mining. They fell head over heels for her. She made us proud by serving her purpose for them. But at the end of the day, being a scraper was her biggest weakness as well. She can't be scaled to production. Moreover, the sites she hunted in the past with great fury, gradually changed. She became a dull blade to get information from them. At her death bed, she crashed multiple times and faced a barrage of criticism.You were our first kiddo. Like Bilal for Mary Teacher. You'll be remembered forever.Rest in peace dear one! We will miss you! Team Workaround&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Though she will kept at PyPI, there won't be any further updates or support from the team. You may use Oxford Dictionary API for your purpose in future.)Link: https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/  Description&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;This package gets you the thesaurus of an inputted word from the best dictionary sites available online. - `Thesaurus.com &lt;http: www.thesaurus.com=&quot;&quot;/&gt;`_- `Dictionary.com &lt;http: www.dictionary.com=&quot;&quot;/&gt;`_  Why you need this package?&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Though python provides lexical resources like WordNet, the variety it can provide is poor. The rich content the `dictionary.com` or the `thesaurus.com` provides will help the user to enhance their approaches when he/she is dealing with text mining, NLP techniques and much more.  How to install? &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Use basic pip install to install this library.  ::  pip install py_thesaurus  Release Notes&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Version 1.0.4 (2018-04-03)--------------------------- A good samaritan of us named Mr. mpkasa spotted an `UnboundedLocalError` rat.  &quot;By the breath of God they perish, And by the blast of His anger they come to an end&quot; - Job Chapter 4 Verse 9Version 1.0.3 (2018-01-13)--------------------------- Solved dependency issue of `lxml`. - Fixed a bug on command line implementation. - Issue tracker link is added in README to report bugs and suggests features.Version 1.0 (2017-12-31)------------------------- Sometimes you need to disagree in life, we added a feature to get antonyms of an inputted word.- Synonyms are not a pile of related words anymore. You want synonyms of ‘love’ as a ‘noun’, you get synonyms of ‘love’ as a ‘noun’. Period.- We love everyone being one of a kind, there will not be any duplicates in output lists anymore.- Output lists are more refined and ordered by relevance since disciplined is new sexy. - 0.95 is a decimal but 0.9.5 has a meaning in software development. We got it late but happily adapted to Semantic Versioning.- Several other bugs are brutally killed during the development of this package. No prayers.How to use PyThesaurus?&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;1.

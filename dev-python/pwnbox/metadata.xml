You're all set to use PwnBox CLI!## Usage```bash$ pwnbox -h # or --helpusage: pwnbox [-h] [-v] [--version] [-b] [-n] [-c CONFIG] [-t TIMEOUT] COMMANDLaunch and manage PwnBox containers.positional arguments:  COMMAND               The action to perform.optional arguments:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  -v, --verbose         Enable verbose output.  --version             Print the current version of the program.  -b, --no-banner       Disable printing the banner.  -n, --no-update       Disable the automatic check for newer PwnBox versions.  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG                        Specify the path to a PwnBox config file.  -t TIMEOUT, --timeout TIMEOUT                        Specify the timeout of waiting for SSH to be available.Commands:  up                    Starts the PwnBox container if not already started, and connects to it.  down                  Stop the PwnBox container.  pull                  Download the latest PwnBox image.  generate              Write the default config to a file.```## ConfigurationAll configuration of the PwnBox container can be done from `pwnbox.conf`, which is by default stored (and created on first run) at `$HOME/.pwnbox/pwnbox.conf`.The configuration file syntax is as follows:```bash[IMAGE]# Where to pull the image from, can be 'ghcr.io' or 'registry.hub.docker.com'DOCKER_REPOSITORY=registry.hub.docker.com# The tag of the image to pull. Can be any specific version you'd likeIMAGE_TAG=latest[CONTAINER]# Name of the container that Docker will giveNAME=pwnbox# Hostname inside the containerHOSTNAME=pwnbox# Should the container run privileged?PRIVILEGED=true# Should the container be removed when stopped?AUTO_REMOVE=true# Enable this to run GUI applications outside the containerX11_FORWARDING=true# Enable this to automatically forward all ports and have direct interace access (only linux)HOST_NETWORKING=true# What ports would you like forwarded? (syntax HOST:CONTAINER with multiple ones being comma seperated)# Should keep 2222 for SSH portFORWARDED_PORT=2222:2222,9000-9010:9000-9010# Where to store the data thats from /mnt/externalEXTERNAL_VOLUME=$HOME/.pnbox/external# Where to fetch public ssh keys fromSSH_VOLUME=$HOME/.ssh```You can always re-generate this file using `pwnbox generate` and copy it to other places to have multiple configurations.## How It WorksWhen bringing up a container, the CLI will:1. Check if Docker is accesible2. Check if the desired PwnBox image is downloaded   1. If it is, check if there is a newer version of the PwnBox image   2. If not, download the latest version available of the image3. Bring up the PwnBox container with the desired settings   1. If X11 Forwarding is enabled, `xhost` is executed to whitelist remote connections from localhost4. Wait for SSH to be available, then SSH into the container## ContributionsPRs are more than welcome! Fix bugs, add features, improve speed or anything else. I will gladly merge them once I have reviewed them.</longdescription>

	<longdescription>**[dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/)** enables data analysts and engineers to transform their data using the same practices that software engineers use to build applications.This package installs the [dbt Cloud CLI](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/configure-cloud-cli) to invoke dbt commands from the command line that execute in a [dbt Cloud](cloud.getdbt.com) environment.## Understanding dbtAnalysts using dbt can transform their data by simply writing select statements, while dbt handles turning these statements into tables and views in a data warehouse.These select statements, or &quot;models&quot;, form a dbt project. Models frequently build on top of one another – dbt makes it easy to [manage relationships](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/ref) between models, and [visualize these relationships](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/documentation), as well as assure the quality of your transformations through [testing](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/testing).![dbt dag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/6c6649f9129d5d108aa3b0526f634cd8f3a9d1ed/etc/dbt-dag.png)## Join the dbt Community- Be part of the conversation in the [dbt Community Slack](http://community.getdbt.com/)- Read more on the [dbt Community Discourse](https://discourse.getdbt.com)</longdescription>

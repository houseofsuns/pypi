	<longdescription># narwhalyetiThis is the interface for interacting with the [Asana Platform](https://developers.asana.com)This Python package is automatically generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project:- API version: 1.0.0- Package version: 0.0.6- Build package: org.openapitools.codegen.languages.PythonClientCodegenFor more information, please visit [https://asana.com/support](https://asana.com/support)## Requirements.Python &gt;=3.6## Installation &amp; Usage### pip installIf the python package is hosted on a repository, you can install directly using:```shpip install git+https://github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID.git```(you may need to run `pip` with root permission: `sudo pip install git+https://github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID.git`)Then import the package:```pythonimport narwhalyeti```### SetuptoolsInstall via [Setuptools](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools).```shpython setup.py install --user```(or `sudo python setup.py install` to install the package for all users)Then import the package:```pythonimport narwhalyeti```## Getting StartedPlease follow the [installation procedure](#installation--usage) and then run the following:```pythonimport timeimport narwhalyetifrom pprint import pprintfrom narwhalyeti.api import attachment_apifrom narwhalyeti.model.attachment_response import AttachmentResponsefrom narwhalyeti.model.error_response import ErrorResponse# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://app.asana.com/api/1.0# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.configuration = narwhalyeti.Configuration(    host = &quot;https://app.asana.com/api/1.0&quot;)# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters# in accordance with the API server security policy.# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that# satisfies your auth use case.# Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: oauth2configuration = narwhalyeti.Configuration(    host = &quot;https://app.asana.com/api/1.0&quot;)configuration.access_token = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'# Configure Bearer authorization: personal_access_tokenconfiguration = narwhalyeti.Configuration(    access_token = 'YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN')# Enter a context with an instance of the API clientwith narwhalyeti.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:    # Create an instance of the API class    api_instance = attachment_api.AttachmentApi(api_client)    opt_fields = [&quot;name&quot;,&quot;parent&quot;] # [str] | Defines fields to return. Some requests return *compact* representations of objects in order to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below. The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options. (optional)    opt_pretty = True # bool | Provides “pretty” output. Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging. (optional)    resource_subtype = &quot;external&quot; # str | The type of the attachment. Must be one of the given values. If not specified, a file attachment of type `asana` will be assumed. Note that if the value of `resource_subtype` is `external`, a `parent`, `name`, and `url` must also be provided.  (optional)    file = open('/path/to/file', 'rb') # file_type | Required for `asana` attachments.  (optional)    parent = &quot;12345&quot; # str | Required identifier of the parent task, project, or project_brief, as a string.  (optional)    url = &quot;https://assets.asana.biz/m/7342a96f034ee491/original/trademark-logo-lockup-horizontal.png&quot; # str | The URL of the external resource being attached. Required for attachments of type `external`.  (optional)    name = &quot;attachment_name&quot; # str | The name of the external resource being attached. Required for attachments of type `external`.  (optional)    connect_to_app = False # bool | *Optional*. Only relevant for external attachments with a parent task. A boolean indicating whether the current app should be connected with the attachment for the purposes of showing an app components widget. Requires the app to have been added to a project the parent task is in.  (optional)    try:        # Upload an attachment        api_response = api_instance.upload_attachment(opt_fields=opt_fields, opt_pretty=opt_pretty, resource_subtype=resource_subtype, file=file, parent=parent, url=url, name=name, connect_to_app=connect_to_app)        pprint(api_response)    except narwhalyeti.ApiException as e:        print(&quot;Exception when calling AttachmentApi-&gt;upload_attachment: %s\n&quot; % e)```## Documentation for API EndpointsAll URIs are relative to *https://app.asana.com/api/1.0*Class | Method | HTTP request | Description------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------*AttachmentApi* | [**upload_attachment**](docs/AttachmentApi.md#upload_attachment) | **POST** /attachments | Upload an attachment*TeamApi* | [**get_teams_for_workspace**](docs/TeamApi.md#get_teams_for_workspace) | **GET** /workspaces/{workspace_gid}/teams | Get teams in a workspace## Documentation For Models - [AttachmentResponse](docs/AttachmentResponse.md) - [AttachmentResponseData](docs/AttachmentResponseData.md) - [AttachmentResponseDataParent](docs/AttachmentResponseDataParent.md) - [ErrorResponse](docs/ErrorResponse.md) - [ErrorResponseErrorsInner](docs/ErrorResponseErrorsInner.md) - [GetTeamsForWorkspace200Response](docs/GetTeamsForWorkspace200Response.md)## Documentation For Authorization## oauth2- **Type**: OAuth- **Flow**: accessCode- **Authorization URL**: https://app.asana.com/-/oauth_authorize- **Scopes**:  - **default**: Provides access to all endpoints documented in our API reference. If no scopes are requested, this scope is assumed by default. - **openid**: Provides access to OpenID Connect ID tokens and the OpenID Connect user info endpoint. - **email**: Provides access to the user’s email through the OpenID Connect user info endpoint. - **profile**: Provides access to the user’s name and profile photo through the OpenID Connect user info endpoint.## personal_access_token- **Type**: Bearer authentication## Author## Notes for Large OpenAPI documentsIf the OpenAPI document is large, imports in narwhalyeti.apis and narwhalyeti.models may fail with aRecursionError indicating the maximum recursion limit has been exceeded. In that case, there are a couple of solutions:Solution 1:Use specific imports for apis and models like:- `from narwhalyeti.api.default_api import DefaultApi`- `from narwhalyeti.model.pet import Pet`Solution 2:Before importing the package, adjust the maximum recursion limit as shown below:```import syssys.setrecursionlimit(1500)import narwhalyetifrom narwhalyeti.apis import *from narwhalyeti.models import *```</longdescription>

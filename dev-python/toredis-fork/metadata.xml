	<longdescription>TOREDIS=======This is minimalistic, but feature rich redis client for Tornado built on top of `hiredis &lt;https://github.com/pietern/hiredis-py&gt;`_ protocol parser.Supports all redis commands, which are auto-generated from the redis `JSON documentation file &lt;https://github.com/antirez/redis-doc/blob/master/commands.json&gt;`_.Key design points:1. While toredis attempts to add some syntactical sugar to the API, all responses are returned &quot;as is&quot;. For example, if command returns   list of items and developer requested only one key, list with one entry will be returned. For example::    def handle(self, result):        print(len(result))    conn.hkeys('test1', handle)2. Most redis commands accept one or more keys. Toredis adds a bit of logic to handle single key or array of keys. Due to python   limitations, it is not possible to use ``*args`` with named ``callback`` argument, so you will have to pass array of key names::    # This will work    conn.blpop('test', callback=callback)    conn.blpop(['test', 'test2'], callback=callback)    # This won't work    conn.blpop('test', 'test2', callback=callback)3. If redis connection will be dropped while waiting for response, callback will be triggered with `None` as a value.4. Toredis does not provide reconnection feature, but you can override :meth:`~toredis.Client.on_disconnect` method and implement your reconnection logic.You can find command `documentation here &lt;https://github.com/mrjoes/toredis/blob/master/toredis/commands.py&gt;`_ (will be moved to rtd later).Pipelining is also supported::    # For more than one pipeline for connection create it with Pipeline(conn)    pipeline = conn.pipeline()    pipeline.set('foo', 'bar')    pipeline.get('foo')    pipeline.send(callback=callback)For more examples please refer to tests.More on `redis pipelining &lt;http://redis.io/topics/pipelining&gt;`_.Things missing:* Backport pure-python redis protocol parser (for PyPy support)* Connection pools</longdescription>

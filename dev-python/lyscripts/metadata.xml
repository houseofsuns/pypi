Essentially, it provides a *command line interface* (CLI) to the [`lymph`](https://github.com/rmnldwg/lymph) library.We are making these &quot;convenience&quot; scripts public, because doing so is one necessary requirement to making our research easily and fully reproducible. There exists another repository, [`lynference`](https://github.com/rmnldwg/lynference), where we store the pipelines that produce(d) our published results in a persistent way. Head over there to learn more about how to reproduce our work.## InstallationThese scripts can be installed via `pip`:```bashpip install lyscripts```or installed from source by cloning this repo```bashgit clone https://github.com/rmnldwg/lyscripts.gitcd lyscriptspip install .```## UsageAfter installing the package, run `lyscripts --help` to see the following output:```USAGE: lyscripts [-h] [-v]                 {app,data,evaluate,plot,predict,sample,temp_schedule} ...Utility for performing common tasks w.r.t. the inference and prediction tasks onecan use the `lymph` package for.POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS:  {app,data,evaluate,plot,predict,sample,temp_schedule}    app                 Module containing scripts to run different `streamlit`                        applications.    data                Provide a range of commands related to datasets on                        patterns of lymphatic progression. Currently, the                        following modules provide additional commands: 1. The                        `lyscripts.data.clean` module that converts a LyProX-style                        table of patient information into a simplified format that                        is used by the `lymph` model. 2. `lyscripts.data.enhance`,                        a module for computing consensus diagnoses and to ensure                        that super- and sublevels are consistently reported. 3.                        The module `lyscripts.data.generate` for creating                        synthetic datasets with certain characteristics. 4.                        Submodule `lyscripts.data.join` to concatenate two                        datasets, e.g. from different institutions. 5.                        `lyscripts.data.split`, a module with which datasets may                        be split into random sets of patient data. The split data                        may then be used e.g. for cross-validation.    evaluate            Evaluate the performance of the trained model by computing                        quantities like the Bayesian information criterion (BIC)                        or (if thermodynamic integration was performed) the actual                        evidence (with error) of the model.    plot                Provide various plotting utilities for displaying results                        of e.g. the inference or prediction process. At the                        moment, three subcommands are grouped under                        `lyscripts.plot`: 1. `lyscripts.plot.corner`, which simply                        outputs a corner plot with nice labels for a set of drawn                        samples. 2. The module `lyscripts.plot.histograms` can be                        used to draw histograms, e.g. the ones over risks and                        prevalences as computed by the `lyscripts.predict` module.                        3. Module `lyscripts.plot.thermo_int` allows comparing                        rounds of thermodynamic integration for different models.    predict             This module provides functions and scripts to predict the                        risk of hidden involvement, given observed diagnoses, and                        prevalences of patterns for diagnostic modalities. The                        submodules for prediction are currently: 1. The                        `lyscripts.predict.prevalences` module for computing                        prevalences of certain involvement patterns that may also                        be compared to observed prevalences. 2. A module                        `lyscripts.predict.risks` for predicting the risk of any                        specific pattern of involvement given any particular                        diagnosis.    sample              Learn the spread probabilities of the HMM for lymphatic                        tumor progression using the preprocessed data as input and                        MCMC as sampling method. This is the central script                        performing for our project on modelling lymphatic spread                        in head &amp; neck cancer. We use it for model comparison via                        the thermodynamic integration functionality and use the                        sampled parameter estimates for risk predictions. This                        risk estimate may in turn some day guide clinicians to                        make more objective decisions with respect to defining the                        *elective clinical target volume* (CTV-N) in radiotherapy.    temp_schedule       Generate inverse temperature schedules for thermodynamic                        integration using various different methods. Thermodynamic                        integration is quite sensitive to the specific schedule                        which is used. I noticed in my models, that within the                        interval $[0, 0.1]$, the increase in the expected                        log-likelihood is very steep. Hence, the inverse                        temparature $\beta$ must be more densely spaced in the                        beginning. This can be achieved by using a power sequence:                        Generate $n$ linearly spaced points in the interval $[0,                        1]$ and then transform each point by computing $\beta_i^k$                        where $k$ could e.g. be 5.OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  -v, --version         Display the version of lyscripts (default: False)```Each of the individual subcommands provides a help page like this respectively that detail the positional and optional arguments along with their function.</longdescription>

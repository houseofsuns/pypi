	<longdescription>python-zeroconf-py2compat=========================    This is a fork of pyzeroconf, Multicast DNS Service Discovery for Python,originally by Paul Scott-Murphy (https://github.com/paulsm/pyzeroconf),modified by William McBrine (https://github.com/wmcbrine/pyzeroconf),and then further modified (off the 0.19.1 tag, the last to support Py2.7)by Jamie Alexandre (https://github.com/learningequality/python-zeroconf).Compatible with:* Bonjour* AvahiCompared to some other Zeroconf/Bonjour/Avahi Python packages, python-zeroconf:* isn't tied to Bonjour or Avahi* doesn't use D-Bus* doesn't force you to use particular event loop or Twisted* is pip-installablePython compatibility--------------------* CPython 2.7, 3.3+* PyPy 2.2+ (possibly 1.9-2.1 as well)* PyPy3 2.4+Versioning----------This project's versions follow the following pattern: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.* MAJOR version has been 0 so far* MINOR version is incremented on backward incompatible changes* PATCH version is incremented on backward compatible changesStatus------There are some people using this package. I don't actively use it and as suchany help I can offer with regard to any issues is very limited.How to get python-zeroconf-py2compat?=====================================* PyPI page https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zeroconf-py2compat* GitHub project https://github.com/learningequality/python-zeroconf-py2compatThe easiest way to install python-zeroconf-py2compat is using pip::    pip install zeroconf-py2compatHow do I use it?================Here's an example of browsing for a service:.. code-block:: python    from six.moves import input    from zeroconf import ServiceBrowser, Zeroconf            class MyListener(object):            def remove_service(self, zeroconf, type, name):            print(&quot;Service %s removed&quot; % (name,))            def add_service(self, zeroconf, type, name):            info = zeroconf.get_service_info(type, name)            print(&quot;Service %s added, service info: %s&quot; % (name, info))            zeroconf = Zeroconf()    listener = MyListener()    browser = ServiceBrowser(zeroconf, &quot;_http._tcp.local.&quot;, listener)    try:        input(&quot;Press enter to exit...\n\n&quot;)    finally:        zeroconf.close().. note::    Discovery and service registration use *all* available network interfaces by default.    If you want to customize that you need to specify ``interfaces`` argument when    constructing ``Zeroconf`` object (see the code for details).If you don't know the name of the service you need to browse for, try:.. code-block:: python    from zeroconf import ZeroconfServiceTypes    print('\n'.join(ZeroconfServiceTypes.find()))See examples directory for more.Changelog=========0.19.16-------- Fix issue preventing TXT record updates from `ServiceBrowser`0.19.15-------- Track all requested broadcast interfaces in addition to those successfully attached0.19.14-------- Exclude addresses starting with &quot;169.254&quot; from the list returned by get_all_addresses()0.19.13-------* Converts some usage of `assert` that should likely persist if `python -O` is used* Breaks out interface attachment from `Zeroconf.__init__` into its own method `_add_interfaces`* Adds corresponding behavior for removing interfaces, along the lines of how `_add_interfaces` functions but in reverse* Exposes new public method `Zeroconf.update_interfaces` which triggers add or removal of interfaces* Prevents stack trace reporting of errors that occur because the network is unreachable, `errno.ENETUNREACH`* Updates `Zeroconf.send` to accept an `interface` on which filter the interfaces it sends the messages on,  such that adding and removing interfaces can attempt to send add/remove messages when the interface is removed0.19.10-------Reduce (and make configurable) the _GLOBAL_DONE threading wait time to improve discovery.0.19.9------Turn _GLOBAL_DONE into a threading Event to allow for better interruptability at close.0.19.8------Handle exceptions in interface enumeration and just return an empty list.0.19.7------Reverted from ifaddr back to ifcfg.0.19.6------Switched from ifcfg to ifaddr for address enumeration.0.19.5------Add support for Android, via pyjnius.0.19.4------Vendored enum compat.0.19.3------* Fix to setup.py, so as to actually include zeroconf.py!0.19.2 (first release in learningequality/python-zeroconf-py2compat)--------------------------------------------------------------------* Replace C-based netifaces with pure-Python ifcfg for portability* Allow the DNS A record address to be determined by outgoing interface IP* Refresh ServiceBrowser entries already when 'stale' (backport from 0.20.0)* Add new records first in cache entry instead of last (backport from 0.20.0)* Correct broken __eq__ in child classes to DNSRecord (backport from 0.20.0)* Fix TTL handling for published service, and use RFC6762 (backport from 0.21.0)* Fix UnboundLocalError for count after loop (backport from 0.21.0)* Fix UTF-8 multibyte name compression (backport from 0.21.0)* Fix a logging call (backport from 0.21.0)* Fix service removal packets not being sent on shutdown (backport from 0.22.0)* MyListener callback on service TXT record changes (backport from 0.23.0)0.19.1------* Allowed installation with netifaces &gt;= 0.10.6 (a bug that was concerning us  got fixed)0.19.0------* Technically backwards incompatible - restricted netifaces dependency version to  work around a bug, see https://github.com/jstasiak/python-zeroconf/issues/84 for  details0.18.0------* Dropped Python 2.6 support* Improved error handling inside code executed when Zeroconf object is being closed0.17.7------* Better Handling of DNS Incoming Packets parsing exceptions* Many exceptions will now log a warning the first time they are seen* Catch and log sendto() errors* Fix/Implement duplicate name change* Fix overly strict name validation introduced in 0.17.6* Greatly improve handling of oversized packets including:  - Implement name compression per RFC1035  - Limit size of generated packets to 9000 bytes as per RFC6762  - Better handle over sized incoming packets* Increased test coverage to 95%0.17.6------* Many improvements to address race conditions and exceptions during ZC()  startup and shutdown, thanks to: morpav, veawor, justingiorgi, herczy,  stephenrauch* Added more test coverage: strahlex, stephenrauch* Stephen Rauch contributed:  - Speed up browser startup  - Add ZeroconfServiceTypes() query class to discover all advertised service types  - Add full validation for service names, types and subtypes  - Fix for subtype browsing  - Fix DNSHInfo support0.17.5------* Fixed OpenBSD compatibility, thanks to Alessio Sergi* Fixed race condition on ServiceBrowser startup, thanks to gbiddison* Fixed installation on some Python 3 systems, thanks to Per Sandström* Fixed &quot;size change during iteration&quot;

It requires python 3.6 or later.### Repository Installation (advanced) Clone this repository, and set up a virtual environment for python 3.6 or later. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the libraries, followed by `pytest` to ensure that all tests are passing as expected.## edx-cleaner UsageUsed to validate OLX (edX XML) code. This is a very light wrapper around the olxcleaner library, but exposes all of the functionality thereof.Basic usage: run `edx-cleaner` in the directory of the course you want to validate.Command-line options:```textedx-cleaner [-h]             [-c COURSE]            [-p {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}]             [-t TREE] [-l {0,1,2,3,4}]            [-q] [-e] [-s] [-S]            [-f {0,1,2,3,4}]            [-i IGNORE [IGNORE ...]]```* `-h`: Display help.* `-c`: Specify the course file to analyze. If not specified, looks for `course.xml` in the current directory. If given a directory, looks for `course.xml` in that directory.* `-p`: Specify the validation level you wish analyze the course at:  * 1: Load the course  * 2: Load the policy and grading policy  * 3: Validate url_names  * 4: Merge policy data with course, ensuring that all references are valid  * 5: Validate the grading policy  * 6: Have every object validate itself  * 7: Parse the course for global errors  * 8: Parse the course for detailed global errors (default)* `-t TREE`: Specify a file to output the tree structure to.* `-l`: Specify the depth level to output the tree structure to. Only used if the `-t` option is set. 0 = Course, 1 = Chapter, 2 = Sequential, 3 = Vertical, 4 = Content. * `-q`: Quiet mode. Does not output anything to the screen.* `-e`: Suppress error listing. Implied by `-q`.* `-s`: Suppress summary of errors. Implied by `-q`.* `-S`: Display course statistics (off by default). Overridden by `-q`.* `-f`: Select the error level at which to exit with an error code. 0 = DEBUG, 1 = INFO, 2 = WARNING, 3 = ERROR (default), 4 = NEVER. Exit code is set to `1` if an error at the specified level or higher is present.* `-i`: Specify a space-separated list of error names to ignore. See [Error Listing](errors.md).## edx-reporter UsageThe olxcleaner library includes modules that parse a course into python objects. This can be useful if you want to scan a course to generate a report. We exploit this in `edx-reporter` to generate a LaTeX report of course structure.Basic usage: run `edx-reporter` in the directory of the course you want to generate a report about.Command-line options:```textedx-reporter.py [-h]                 [-c COURSE]                [-u]                [&gt; latexfile.tex]```* `-h`: Display help.* `-c`: Specify the course file to analyze. If not specified, looks for `course.xml` in the current directory. If given a directory, looks for `course.xml` in that directory.* `-u`: Include url_names for verticals.* `&gt; latexfile.tex`: Output the report to a file.If you get an error like ``Character cannot be encoded into LaTeX: U+FEFF - `'``, then you have some bad unicode in your `display_name` entries. Look through the LaTeX output for `{\bfseries ?}`, which is what that character is converted into.Once you have generated a latex file, you can compile it into a PDF file by running `pdflatex latexfile.tex`. Note that the latex file can be modified with any text editor; its format should be self-explanatory.## Library usageThe workhorse of the library is `olxcleaner.validate`, which validates a course in a number of steps.```pythonolxcleaner.validate(filename, steps=8, ignore=None, allowed_xblocks=None)```* `filename`: Pass in either the course directory or the path of `course.xml` for the course you wish to validate.* `steps`: Choose how many validation steps you wish to perform:    * 1: Load the course    * 2: Load the policy and grading policy    * 3: Validate `url_name`s    * 4: Merge policy data with course, ensuring that all references are valid    * 5: Validate the grading policy    * 6: Have every object validate itself    * 7: Parse the course for global errors    * 8: Parse the course for global errors that may be time-consuming to detect* `ignore`: A list of error names to ignore* `allowed_xblocks`: A list of all allowed xblocks that course olx may contain.Returns `EdxCourse`, `ErrorStore`, `url_names` (dictionary `{'url_name': EdxObject}`, or `None` if `steps &lt; 3`)See examples of how to use `olxcleaner.validate` and the objects it returns in `olxcleaner.entries`.</longdescription>

Do you work by yourself or on a team?Do you share notebooks or are you committing code to a shared repository? Incontrast to successful, massively collaborative, open-source projects likethe Linux kernel, the Rails framework, Firefox, GNU, or Tensorflow, mostdata science projects are developed by just a handful of people. But think ifthe open-source community could leverage its ingenuity and determination tocollaboratively develop data science projects to predict the incidence ofdisease in a population, to predict whether vulnerable children will be evictedfrom their homes, or to predict whether learners will drop out of onlinecourses.Our vision is to make collaborative data science possible by making it morelike open-source software development. Our approach is based on decomposing thedata science process into modular patchesthat can then be intelligently combined, representing objects like &quot;feature definition&quot;,&quot;labeling function&quot;, or &quot;prediction task definition&quot;. Collaborators work inparallel to write patches and submit them to a repo. The core Ballet frameworkprovides the underlying functionality to merge high-quality contributions,collect modules from the file system, and compose the accepted contributionsinto a single product. It also provides [Assemblé](https://github.com/ballet/ballet-assemble), a familiar notebook-based developmentexperience that is friendly to data scientists and other inexperiencedopen-source contributors. We don't require any computing infrastructure beyondthat which is commonly used in open-source software development.Currently, Ballet focuses on supporting collaboratively developing*feature engineering pipelines*, an important part of many data scienceprojects. Individual feature definitions are represented as separate Python modules,declaring the subset of a dataframe that they operate on and ascikit-learn-style learned transformer that extracts feature values from theraw data. Ballet collects individual feature definitions and composes them into afeature engineering pipeline. At any point, a project built on Ballet can beinstalled for end-to-end feature engineering on new data instances for thesame problem. How do we ensure the feature engineering pipeline is alwaysuseful? Ballet thoroughly validates proposed feature definitions for correctness andmachine learning performance, using an extensive test suite and a novelstreaming feature definition selection algorithm. Accepted feature definitions can beautomatically merged by the [Ballet Bot](https://github.com/ballet/ballet-bot) into projects.&lt;img src=&quot;./docs/_static/feature_lifecycle.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ballet Feature Lifecycle&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;## Next steps*Are you a data owner or project maintainer that wants to organize acollaboration?*👉 Check out the [Ballet Maintainer Guide](https://ballet.github.io/ballet/maintainer_guide.html)*Are you a data scientist or enthusiast that wants to join a collaboration?*👉 Check out the [Ballet Contributor Guide](https://ballet.github.io/ballet/contributor_guide.html)*Want to learn about how Ballet enables Better Feature Engineering™️?*👉 Check out the [Feature Engineering Guide](https://ballet.github.io/ballet/feature_engineering_guide.html)*Want to see a demo collaboration in progress and maybe even participate yourself?*👉 Check out the [ballet-predict-house-prices](https://github.com/HDI-Project/ballet-predict-house-prices) project## Source code organizationThis is a quick overview to the Ballet core source code organization.

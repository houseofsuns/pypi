	<longdescription>Nutorious=========Nutorious is a command-line tool to track your nutrition in plaintext files. This includes the usual kcal, protein, carbs, fats, but also any other ingredient of your choosing, i.e. sugar, salt, etc. I was inspired by the https://plaintextaccounting.org/, when at some point I wanted to start counting calories and realized that none of the phone apps are flexible/easy-to-use enough for my needs, especially after trying plaintext for accouting. Another inspiration came from [Calorific](https://github.com/peterkeen/calorific) to use simple yaml format for the journal files. The Calorific is a great tool, but I wanted a bit better UX.### InstallationNutorious is available in PyPI, so it can be installed the usual way using the `pip` command:```bashpip install --upgrade nutorious```### JournalNutorious is using simple yml files for tracking. The CLI let's you specify the journal directory that will be recursively scanned for all .yml files. The `config.yml`, if present, will be treated as a custom configuration file (see below), other files will be parsed in no particular order and merged together to form a full final journal.Example can be found in the directory [journal-example](https://github.com/dzmitry-paulenka/nutorious/tree/master/journal-example)Journal files should have next format:```yamlyyyy-mm-dd:  &lt;food-or-meal-name&gt;:    - &lt;food-spec-entry-1&gt;    - &lt;food-spec-entry-2&gt;```Example:```yaml# using some date in the past to define common food, that doesn't change1970-07-07:  # next lines use the simplicity of yaml to specify the food-spec    # proteins  egg: [ 77.5 kcal, 6.3 prot, 0 carb, 5.3 fat, 50g, countable ]  eggs: [ 77.5 kcal, 6.3 prot, 0 carb, 5.3 fat, 50g, countable ]  chicken: [ 115 kcal, 21.2 prot, 0.0 carb, 2.6 fat ]  roasted-chicken: [ 100 chicken, 75g ]  salmon: [ 142 kcal, 19.8 prot, 0.0 carb, 6.3 fat ]  # carbs  spaget: [ 351 kcal, 14 prot, 70 carb, 1 fat ]  rice: [ 344 kcal, 6.7 prot, 78.9 carb, 0.7 fat ]  # ... similar for other common products  2023-05-30:  bread: [ 310 kcal, 10.8 prot, 37.7 carb, 11.6 fat ]  salad:    - 300 cabbage    - 100 carrot    - 200 pepper    - 20 oil    - 2x  breakfast:    - 50 bread    - 50 avocado    - 1 egg    - 10 oil    lunch:    - 1 salad    - 100 rice    - 200 roasted-chicken```So top level entries are the journaling dates. Second levels are the food name or a meal name. Meal names can be specified in the config, and by default are **breakfast, lunch, snack and dinner**, everything else is considered a custom food item. Meals are treated differently in the reports, but the specification is exactly the same. And third level is the list of food specification entries.#### Food specificiationThe food/meal specification can include the following items:* **[amount] [food-name]** - food ingredient. Means that this food item contains this amount of other food/component.```yaml- 1 egg- 100 rice```* **countable** - mark this food item as countable. Meaning that referenced amounts of this item in other foods will be computed not on a gramm ratio, but on a number ratio. This is useful for countable items like eggs.```yaml  egg: [ 77.5 kcal, 6.3 prot, 5.3 fat, 50g, countable ]```* **[amount]x** - mark this food item as countable and specify the base amount of resulting items. I.e. divide all specified ingredients to this many &quot;portions&quot; to compute a 1 base item contents. Usefull for equal portioning of prepared food.```yaml  steak:    - 500 beef    - 20 oil    - 20 balsamic    - 10 salt    - 2x```* **[amount]g** - specify a resulting weight of the food. This can be used for measuring the food after the preparation, when you can't use simple portioning. ```yaml  egg-rice:    - 200 rice    - 3 eggs    - 600g # gets bigger after preparation```#### Food weightIf weight is not specified explicitly, it uses next heuristic to determine a weight:* **100g** for the food, that only contains &quot;undefined&quot; references. This is useful for adding numbers directly from labels as they usually go on the base of 100g.```yaml  bread: [ 310 kcal, 10.8 prot, 37.7 carb, 11.6 fat ]```* **sum of ingredients** for the food, that contains previously defined/weighted ingredients.```yaml  # default weight of 1 &quot;salad item&quot; is (300 + 100 + 200 + 20) / 2 = 310  salad:    - 300 cabbage    - 100 carrot    - 200 pepper    - 20 oil    - 2x```#### Food registryAfter the food is defined it can be referenced on current or any future dates. ```yaml2023-03-03:  egg-rice:    - 200 rice    - 3 eggs    - 600g # gets bigger after preparation  lunch:    - 200 egg-rice2023-03-04:  lunch:    - 200 egg-rice # leftovers2023-03-05:  lunch:    - 200 egg-rice # more leftovers```If the food is redefined, all future references will use this new version. The idea is that usually you have just one &quot;bread&quot; in your kitchen, but it can have different contents. So once the old one is finished and you bought the new one, you just add it with the same name &quot;bread&quot;.```yaml2023-03-03:  bread: [ 200 kcal, 7.6 prot, 42.7 carb, 9 fat ]  breakfast:    - 50 bread # 100 kcal 2023-03-04:  breakfast:    - 50 bread # still 100 kcal 2023-03-05:  bread: [ 300 kcal, 10.8 prot, 37.7 carb, 11.6 fat ]  breakfast:    - 50 bread # 150 kcal ```### Usage```$ nutorious report --helpUsage: nutorious report [OPTIONS]  Shows report on a date, closest to specified date.Options:  --journal_path, --j DIRECTORY  Path to the journal directory. Default:                                 current directory.  --date, --d [%Y-%m-%d]         Date of the report. Default is 'today'.  --watch, --w                   Show live view of the report and update it,                                 when journal files change.  --help                         Show this message and exit.```Example usage:![example-journal](assets/journal-example.png)### ConfigurationIf journal directory contains file named `config.yml`, it will be treated as a custom configuration file.This file will be merged on top of the default to determine the full final configuration.The default configuration file is [here](https://github.com/dzmitry-paulenka/nutorious/blob/master/src/nutorious/config/default.yml) and looks like this:```yamlmeals:  - breakfast  - lunch  - snack  - dinnerui:  daily:    title: Nutrition report on {dt}    columns:      - data: title        style: cyan        justify: left      - data: amount        style: green      - data: kcal        style: blue      - data: prot        style: white      - data: carb        style: yellow      - data: fat        style: red```</longdescription>

	<longdescription># pyapes: PYthon Awesome Partial differential Equation Solver (general purpose finite difference PDE solver)![python](http://ForTheBadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)## Description`pyapes` is designed to solve various engineering problems in rectangular grid.The goal of `pyapes` (should be/have) is- Cross-platform  - Both tested on Mac and Linux (Arch)  - Windows support is under testing- GPU acceleration in a structured grid with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org)  - Use of `torch.Tensor`. User can choose either `torch.device(&quot;cpu&quot;)` or `torch.device(&quot;cuda&quot;)`.- Generically expressed (OpenFOAM-like, human-readable formulation)## InstallationWe recommend to use `poetry` to manage/install all dependencies.- From `git`  ```bash  git clone git@gitlab.ethz.ch:kchung/pyapes.git  cd pyapes  poetry install  ```- From `pypi`  ```bash  python3 -m pip install pyapes  # or  poetry add pyapes  ```## Dependencies- Core dependency  - `python &gt;= 3.10`    - As of 19.02.2023, `torch` does not support 3.11 properly (for the official release). Therefore, stick to `python3.10`.  - `torch &gt;= 1.10.0`- Dependencies from my personal projects  - `pymyplot` (plotting tools)  - `pymytools` (misc. tools including data I/O, logging, etc.)## Implemented Features- CPU/GPU(CUDA) computation using `torch`- (OpenFOAM like) generically expressed solver  ```python    &gt;&gt;&gt; solver.set_eq(fdm.laplacian(1.0, var) == rhs)    &gt;&gt;&gt; solver.solve()  ```- FDM Discretizations  - Spatial: `Grad`, `Laplacian`, `Div`    - Supports flux limiter `upwind` for the `Div` operator  - Temporal: `Ddt`- Boundary conditions:  - Supports `Dirichlet`, `Neumann`, `Periodic`, and `Symmetry`- Demo cases in `jupter` notebooks## ExamplesCheck our [demos files](demos/)## Todos- Boundary conditions  - [ ] Inflow/Outflow- Need different derivative order at the cell face  - Additional features    - [ ] High order time discretization    - [ ] Immersed body BC    - [ ] Higher order flux limiters (`quick`)- Testing and validation  - [ ] `Ddt` class (implementation is tested but haven't validated with practical test cases)- Working on demo files  - [x] The Poisson equation  - [x] The advection-diffusion equation  - [ ] The Burgers' equation  - [ ] The Navier-Stokes equation at low Reynolds numbers  - [ ] The Black-Scholes equation</longdescription>

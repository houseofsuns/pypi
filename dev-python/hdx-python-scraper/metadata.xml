It uses a YAML file that specifies for each source what needs to be read and allows some transformations to be performed on the data. The output is written to JSON, Google sheets and/or Excel and includes the addition of [Humanitarian Exchange Language (HXL)](https://hxlstandard.org/) hashtags specified in the YAML file. Custom Python scrapers can also be written that conform to a defined specification and the framework handles the execution of both configurable and custom scrapers.For more information, please read the [documentation](https://hdx-python-scraper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This library is part of the [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/) (HDX) project. If you have humanitarian related data, please upload your datasets to HDX.</longdescription>

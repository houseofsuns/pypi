They allow to draw any of these solutions in the β vs α domain (basal slope against surface slope). Are availables compressive or extensive geological context and fluid pore pressure.**ECCW** and **ECCW-GUI** are under GNU GPL-v3 license.*******************************************************************Overview========General informations++++++++++++++++++++* *ECCW* is a *python3* library;* *ECCW-GUI* is a graphical user interface, written in *python3* and using *Qt*;* In the GUI, you can save a session and keep it in an xml file (.eccw);* A pdf documentation is available (see Usage section) including:    * usage explainations;    * theoretical explainations     * guidelines of the results interpretation;    * blueprints of the equations implemantation.Calculator App++++++++++++++* Compute the solution of the *Critical Coulomb Wedge* for compressive or extensive tectonic context, with or without fluids overpressure.* The solution can be computed with one of the four main parameters set as unknown.* A range of solutions can be computed at once if you set one of the known parameters as a range.|Screen copy of calculator-app|Plot App++++++++* Plot the solution of the *Critical Coulomb Wedge* in matplotlib windows (includes zooms, exports, and more).* A range of solutions can be ploted at once if you set one of the known parameters as a range.* You can explore graphically points on the solution curve, with optional display of a sketch representing orientations and directions of faults.* Refrences points can be manually added or imported from .csv files.|Screen copy of plot-app||Screen copy of plot-app's plot window|*******************************************************************Installation============Windows+++++++.. note :: Only tested on *Windows 7*.* Install a **python3** distribution.  The **miniconda** distribution from https://conda.io/miniconda.html is a good choice.  *  Download the proper installer (the 64-bit version should be appropriated).  *  Run the downloaded ``.exe``;* Intall *ECCW*.  * Open a shell that can access your python3 distribution, such as the *Windows Power Shell*.    If you choosed to install **miniconda**, you should use the *Anaconda Prompt*.    You can access it by typing ``anaconda`` in the main Windows menu.  * In the shell, type the following command::      pip install --upgrade pip        pip install eccw-gui* ECCW is then available from the main Windows menu by taping ``eccw`` or from a shell by taping ``python -m eccw_gui``.* Optionally, you can run the ``eccw_windows_install`` command in a shell to install menu and desktop shortcuts.   To remove these shortcuts, run the ``eccw_windows_remove`` command.Linux+++++.. note :: Only tested on *Ubuntu 18.04*.* Install **python3** with **pip** and **tk**.   On *Debian* family distributions, you can install these packages using the following command::      $ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-tk2. Install *ECCW* with the following command::      $ pip3 install --upgrade pip      $ pip3 install eccw-gui3. *ECCW* is then available from the main menu under the name **eccw**.*******************************************************************Usage=====GUI usage+++++++++Simply type ``eccw`` in a shell to launch *eccw*.The GUI should also be available from the main menu.To obtain help with text based mode, type::    $ eccw -hYou can access an off-line documentation using the button 'Documentation' in the GUI.Alternatively, you can use the following command, without the GUI::    $ eccw -dYou can launch the GUI with the ``-m`` option of python using the canonic syntax::     python -m eccw_guiPython library usage++++++++++++++++++++You can import and use the core objects for computing and plotting *Critical Coulomb Wedge* from a python session as discribed in what follows.EccwCompute-----------This the core object that compute the solutions of the *CCW* problem.::    &gt;&gt;&gt; from eccw import EccwCompute    &gt;&gt;&gt; foo = EccwCompute(phiB=30, phiD=10, beta=0)    &gt;&gt;&gt; foo.show_params()    { context       : 'Compression'      beta          : 0.0      alpha         : nan      phiB          : 30.0      phiD          : 10.0      rho_f         : 0.0      rho_sr        : 0.0      delta_lambdaB : 0.0      delta_lambdaD : 0.0    }    &gt;&gt;&gt; foo.compute(&quot;alpha&quot;)    ((3.4365319302835018,), (23.946319406533199,))    The result obtained with the ``compute`` method is always a tuple of two tuples.The first tuple contains results in **inverse** fault mechanism, while the second tuple contains results in **normal** fault mechanism.These tuples can each contain 0, 1 or 2 values, with a total always equal to 0 or 2.Here some more examples with computation of beta ``parameter``::::    &gt;&gt;&gt; foo.alpha = 3.436532    &gt;&gt;&gt; foo.compute(&quot;beta&quot;)     ((-1.0516746372768912e-07,), (69.6779628783264,))    &gt;&gt;&gt; foo.alpha = 20    &gt;&gt;&gt; foo.compute(&quot;beta&quot;)     ((), (-3.580929608343892, 43.25889259183777))    &gt;&gt;&gt; foo.alpha = -20    &gt;&gt;&gt; foo.compute(&quot;beta&quot;)     ((36.74110740816224, 83.58092960834391), ())    &gt;&gt;&gt; foo.alpha = -35    &gt;&gt;&gt; foo.compute(&quot;beta&quot;)     ((), ())Have a look on the plot obtained in next section to understand these results.EccwPlot--------This the core object that plot the solutions of the *CCW* problem. This object inherits from ``EccwCompute``.::    &gt;&gt;&gt; from eccw import EccwPlot    &gt;&gt;&gt; foo = EccwPlot(phiB=30, phiD=10)    &gt;&gt;&gt; foo.add_curve(inverse={'color':(1,0,0,1), 'label':'inverse'},                       normal={'color':(0,0,1,1), 'label':'normal'})    &gt;&gt;&gt; foo.add_point(alpha=3.436532)    &gt;&gt;&gt; foo.add_point(alpha=20, style='*', size=10)    &gt;&gt;&gt; foo.add_point(alpha=-20, style='s')    &gt;&gt;&gt; foo.add_legend()    &gt;&gt;&gt; foo.show()|Screen copy of EccwPlot's plot|*******************************************************************Contributing============Additional dependancies+++++++++++++++++++++++Some softwares are needed to convert Qt specific files into python code:* ``pyuic5`` is used to convert form ``.ui`` files into python code calling PyQt;* ``pyrcc5`` is used to convert Qt ressources files ``.qrc`` into python module.Both are found in following dependancies (ubuntu / debian):    | pyqt5-dev-toolsIf you want to install Qt-designer for Qt5 on Ubuntu/debian, this app is included in the following package:    | qttools5-dev-toolsInformations for developpers++++++++++++++++++++++++++++* Convert ``.ui`` files created using *Qt-Designer* into python files::    $ pyuic5 -x xxx.ui -o xxx_Viewer.py  Some bash scripts located in ``eccw_gui/*/viewers`` folders named ``make_viewers.sh`` automatise this process.  Some custom corrections of *Qt* objects dimensions are also embedded in some of these script.* Convert *Qt* ressources ``.qrc`` files created using *Qt-Designer* into python files::    $ pyrcc5 xxx.qrc -o xxx_rc.py  These ressources files are a smart way to embed images into source code and solve the access path to these images problem after desktop installation.* All graphical object (Qt-derived) get the following methods:  getParams:    return an OrderedDict that describe the state of the object.  setParams:       set the object with a dict obtained from getParams.    getSelect:    return an OrderedDict that describe the selected parameters to treat (equal to getParams if the paramters gets single state)... _eccw: https://github.com/bclmary/eccw.git.. _eccw-gui: https://github.com/bclmary/eccw_gui.git.. |ECCW-GUI| image:: ./eccw_gui/images/eccw-gui_title.png    :alt: ECCW    :height: 200.. |Screen copy of calculator-app| image:: eccw_gui/images/screen-copy_calculator-app.png    :alt: screen copy of calculator app    :width: 600.. |Screen copy of plot-app| image:: eccw_gui/images/screen-copy_plot-app.png    :alt: screen copy of plot app    :width: 600.. |Screen copy of plot-app's plot window| image:: eccw_gui/images/screen-copy_plot-app_plot.png    :alt: screen copy of plot window of plot app    :width: 600.. |Screen copy of EccwPlot's plot| image:: eccw_gui/images/EccwPlot_example.png    :alt: screen copy of matplotlib window containing ECCW plot    :width: 600</longdescription>

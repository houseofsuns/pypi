Its purpose is to generate device configurations ranging from simple to complex. Its name derives from the types of devices it was designed for: DPUs (Data Processing Units), IPUs (Infrastructure Processing Units) or SmartNICs, as the case may be.## Use CasesThe initial version supports the [DASH](https://github.com/Azure/DASH) project. Specifically, `dpugen` generates entries used to configure a DASH-capable device for networking services. See [DASH](https://github.com/Azure/DASH) documentation for more details.The initial use-case focuses specifically on the DASH [SAI](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI) or Switch-Abstraction Interface. SAI has been extended from traditional L2/L3 datacenter swtches and routers, to now support L4 stateful processing, offloaded by DPUs.## InstallationThe easiest way to install is via Pip:```pip3 install dpugen```## Command-line vs. Module`dpugen` can be used either as a standalone executable or a Python module imported into another program.### Command-line modeIn *command-line mode*, the program can generate text or files containing JSON &quot;records.&quot; These records comprise the configuration of the device under test (DUT). The JSON would typically be stored in a file or observed/captured on &quot;standard out,&quot; then used by some other tool such as a test runner: the file is read, then converted into comands to configure the DUT.When loaded from a file using a package such as Python [json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html), the resulting data structure is a list of dictionary items, each one comprising a configuration item. This item might be one table entry, or a list of bulk-table entries.**Command-line Usage:**Assuming you've pip-installed the module:```python3 -m dpugen.sai [options]```If you've cloned the source but not installed as a module:```dpugen$ dpugen/sai.py [options]```Examples:```python3 -m dpugen.sai -h              # show helppython3 -m dpugen.sai                 # generate default JSON to stdoutpython3 -m dpugen.sai -o sample.json  # generate default JSON to a file```### Module ModeWhen used as a module, the package is imported by another program and used to generate streaming &quot;records&quot; via an `items()` iterator method. This allows the consuming program to fetch items one at a time, in the correct order, and apply them to the device. The items fetched are dictionary structures, corresponding exactly to the equivalent JSON objects emitted in command-line mode.**Module Usage:**See [dpugen/examples/](dpugen/examples/) for sample programs. Here is a minimal example, generating a default configuration to standard out:```#!/usr/bin/python3# configuration using default scaling parameters.import dpugenfrom saigen.confbase import *from saigen.confutils import *from pprint import pprintif __name__ == '__main__':    # Instantiate    conf = dpugen.sai.SaiConfig()    conf.generate()    pprint(conf.items())```# ArchitectureThe figure below depicts the architecture of `dpugen` on the left, and potential use-cases on the right.![dpugen-arch/](images/dpugen-arch.svg)The top-level generator e.g. [sai.py](dpugen/sai.py) contains various sub-generators, each one of which is reponsible for generating a particular type of configuration object.  The sub-generator code modules are stored under a subdirectory, e.g. the [dpugen/saigen/](dpugen/saigen) directory contains sub-generators for [sai.py](dpugen/sai.py).For example, [enis.py](dpugen/saigen/enis.py) generates ENIs (Elastic Network Interfaces), [acl_groups.py](dpugen/saigen/acl_groups.py) generates ACLs (Acess Control lists) and ACL Groups, etc. Each sub-generator can be used independently as a module or command-line executable, but the normal practice is to use the top-level generator.The generator can be fed scaling parameters to control the number of entities it generates. It also has defaults, allowing it to generate a configuration such as shown in the examples above with no parameters. Furthermore, you can specify things like starting IP address, address step, etc., but these lower-level parameters can usually be left to their defaults.The output is meant to be consumed by a test runner such as Pytest, which in turn would configure a device using its native API. The SAI records are in a generic format and need to be translated into device RPC calls. This is outside the scope of this document. One example test framework which does this is [SAI Challenger](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI-Challenger) , and it is used in the [DASH](https://github.com/Azure/DASH) project.As explained above, `dpugen` can be used in command-line mode to emit JSON records, or in module mode to be imported by another program. The diagram above shows both of these modes.</longdescription>

	<longdescription>Harbormaster============[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/docker_harbormaster)](https://pypi.org/project/docker-harbormaster/)Harbormaster is a small utility that lets you easily deploy multipleDocker-Compose applications on a single host.It does this by taking a list of git repository URLs that contain DockerCompose files and running the Compose apps they contain. It will also handleupdating/restarting the apps when the repositories change.## RationaleDo you have a home server you want to run a few apps on, but don't want everything tobreak every time you upgrade the OS? Do you want automatic updates but don't want to buyan extra 4 servers so you can run Kubernetes?Do you have a work server that you want to run a few small services on, but don't wantto have to manually manage it? Do you find that having every deployment action be ina git repo more tidy?Harbormaster is for you.At its core, Harbormaster takes a YAML config file with a list of git repository URLscontaining Docker Compose files, clones/pulls them, and starts the services theydescribe.You run Harbormaster on a timer, pointing it to a directory, and it updates all therepositories in its configuration, and restarts the Compose services if they havechanged. That's it!It also cleanly stores data for all apps in a single `data/` directory, so you alwayshave one directory that holds all the state, which you can easily back up and restore.## How it worksLet's say you have the application you want to run, in a git repository, witha `docker-compose.yml` file in the same repo.Ideally, you'd want a flow that would fetch new commits in that repo, and restart theDocker container if there were any changes.That's all Harbormaster does. Simply tell it where your application lives, in the formof a `harbormaster.yml` file:```yamlapps:  myapp:    url: https://github.com/someuser/somerepo.git```Then run `harbormaster -c harbormaster.yml`, and Harbormaster will clone the repo youspecified in the config, and run `docker compose up` on it.It does some other nice things, like give you separate directories for the repos andtheir data, so you can easily make backups of your apps, and that's about it!If you run Harbormaster again, it will check that repo for changes, and if it finds any,it will pull them, stop the container, and start it again with the new changes.## InstallationYou can run Harbormaster directly from Docker, without installing anything. Skip down tothe [Docker installation](#docker-installation) section.Installing Harbormaster is simple. You can use `pipx` (recommended):```$ pipx install docker-harbormaster```Or `pip` (less recommended):```$ pip install docker-harbormaster```You need to also make sure you have `git` installed on your system.You can also download a standalone executable for Linux from the [pipelinespage](https://gitlab.com/stavros/harbormaster/-/pipelines).## Docker installationYou can run Harbormaster by using just Docker. You need to follow a few simple steps to setup your configuration and SSH:* Your `harbormaster.yml` configuration file should be in a git repository. Check that  repository out into some directory, that we're going to call your &quot;config&quot; directory.* If you need an SSH key to pull the Harbormaster configuration file and the various  repositories, copy the private key into your config directory, to a file called  `ssh_private_key` (make sure it's not protected with a passphrase).* Make a directory for Harbormaster to work in somewhere. All your apps' data is going  to reside in that directory.* Run the Harbormaster image:```bashdocker run -d \    --restart unless-stopped \    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \    -v &lt;the path to your config directory&gt;:/config \    -v &lt;the path to your Harbormaster working directory&gt;:/main \    stavros/harbormaster```Harbormaster will now run every five minutes, pull your config repository (from whateverremote it has), and run the apps in the config.If you want to run it immediately at some point, you can use the following command:```bash$ docker exec -i -t &lt;container id&gt; /usr/bin/run-harbormaster```Alternatively you can use `stavros/harbormaster:webhook` which ships with[webhook](https://github.com/adnanh/webhook) to trigger updates. The image comes withan example configuration but you should mount a custom one to `/hooks.json` with proper[rules](https://github.com/adnanh/webhook/blob/master/docs/Hook-Rules.md) for verifyingthe source.## UsageHarbormaster uses a single YAML configuration file that's basically a list ofrepositories containing `docker-compose.yml` files/apps to deploy:```yamlconfig:  # Prune *all unused* system images after a run. Good for saving space on the host.  # Careful, if you run this on a system with other Docker images, it will delete them.  prune: trueapps:  myapp:    # The git repository URL to clone.    url: https://github.com/someuser/somerepo.git    # Which branch to deploy.    branch: main    # The environment variables to run Compose with.    environment:      FOO: bar      MYVAR: 1    # A file to load environment variables from. The file must consist of lines    # in the form of key=value. The filename is relative to the Harbormaster    # config file (this file). This can also be a YAML file with the .yml extension,    # containing a single YAML collection of string values.    # Variables in the `environment` key above take precedence over variables    # in the file.    # Make sure all these variable names appear in the `environment` section of the    # app's `docker-compose.yml` file.    environment_file: &quot;somefile.txt&quot;  otherapp:    url: https://gitlab.com/otheruser/otherrepo.git    # The Compose config filename, if it's not docker-compose.yml, or if you    # want to use Harbormaster-specific overrides:    compose_config:      - docker-compose.yml      - docker-compose.harbormaster.yml    # A dictionary of replacements (see below).    replacements:      MYVOLUMENAME: volume    # A file containing replacements. Works in the exact same way as the    # `environment_file` above.    replacements_file: &quot;otherfile.txt&quot;    # A YAML environment file.    environment_file: &quot;somefile.yml&quot;  oldapp:    # This is an old app, so it shouldn't be run.    enabled: false    # Two apps can use the same repo.    url: https://gitlab.com/otheruser/otherrepo.git```Then, just execute `harbormaster run` in the same directory as that configuration file.Harbormaster will parse the file, automatically download the repositoriesmentioned in it (and keep them up to date).Harbormaster only ever writes to the working directory you specify, and nowhereelse. All the data for each Compose app is under `&lt;workdir&gt;/data/&lt;appname&gt;`, soyou can easily back up the entire data directory in one go.**WARNING:** Make sure the Compose config in each of the repos does not use the`container_name` directive, otherwise Harbormaster might not always be able toterminate your apps when necessary.## TestingWhen developing Harbormaster-compatible Compose files for our app, you usually need totest them.  The naive way requires you to write a Harbormaster configuration file,create a repository for your app, commit the app's Compose file in it, and runHarbormaster with the configuration file to test.To make this easier, Harbormaster includes the `harbormaster test` command, which willcreate a temporary directory for the data/cache/etc directories, and run the Composefiles directly from your repository, without committing or writing a Harbormasterconfiguration file.Run `harbormaster test --help` to see the available options.## Recommended deployment**Note:** The Harbormaster Docker image mentioned in &quot;Docker installation&quot; is stillrelatively new, but it's a very convenient way to deploy Harbormaster without installinganything. That may become the recommended way to deploy Harbormaster in the future.The recommended way to run Harbormaster is on a timer. You can use systemd, with twofiles. Put the Harbormaster configuration YAML in a repository, and clone it somewhere.Then, use the two files to run Harbormaster in that repository.**/etc/systemd/system/harbormaster.service**:```toml[Unit]Description=Run the Harbormaster updaterWants=harbormaster.timer[Service]ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/harbormaster runExecStartPre=/usr/bin/git pullWorkingDirectory=&lt;the repository directory&gt;[Install]WantedBy=multi-user.target```**/etc/systemd/system/harbormaster.timer**:```toml[Unit]Description=Run Harbormaster every few minutes.Requires=harbormaster.service[Timer]Unit=harbormaster.serviceOnUnitInactiveSec=5m[Install]WantedBy=timers.target```Then, run:```bashsudo systemctl daemon-reloadsudo systemctl enable harbormaster# To run Harbormaster immediately:sudo service harbormaster start# To check the Harbormaster run logs:sudo journalctl -fu harbormaster```This will run Harbormaster every five minutes, pulling your configuration repositorybefore the run.## Recommended repository layoutUsually, you will have one repository per app. However, for small apps, like ones thatalready have a Docker container on the Docker Hub (and thus just need a Compose file),it might be more convenient to store the Compose file(s) in the same repository as theHarbormaster config, one branch per app.That way, you can pull the Harbormaster configuration and all the app definitions in thesame way, from the same repository, and specify the branch to load the app from with the`branch` directive in the config.## Recommended secrets handlingThe recommended way for handling secrets is to add plaintext files toa `secrets/` subdirectory of the repository (e.g. `secrets/myservice.txt`) and use[git-crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt) to encrypt them. That way, it's easy toadd more secrets to the repository, but also only authorized people and the deploymentserver has access to the files.## Handling data directoriesDue to the way Compose files work, you need to do some extra work to properlytell Harbormaster about your volumes.Harbormaster provides two kinds of directories: Data and cache.Data is anything that you want to keep. Data directories will never be deleted,if you remove an app later on, its corresponding data directory will be movedunder the `archives/` directory and renamed to `&lt;appname&gt;-&lt;deletion date&gt;`.Cache is anything you don't care about. When you remove an app from the config,the cache dir is deleted.Harbormaster will look for a file called `docker-compose.yml` at the root of therepo, and look for some specific strings (you read more about this in the&quot;replacements&quot; section below).The built-in strings to be replaced are:* `{{ HM_DATA_DIR }}` - The app's data that you want to persist. Will be stored in the  `data/` directory, under the main Harbormaster working directory.* `{{ HM_CACHE_DIR }}` - Any data you don't want to keep. Will be stored in the `cache/`  directory, under the main Harbormaster working directory.* `{{ HM_REPO_DIR }}` - The app's repository. Use this if you want to mount the app's  directory itself, for example to access some code that you don't want to copy into the  container.They will be replaced with the proper directory names (without trailingslashes), so the `volumes` section of your Compose file in your repositoryshould look something like this:```yamlvolumes:  - {{ HM_DATA_DIR }}/my_data:/some_data_dir  - {{ HM_DATA_DIR }}/foo:/home/foo  - {{ HM_CACHE_DIR }}/my_cache:/some_cache_dir```### ReplacementsSometimes, the user needs to give access to paths that already exist on theirsystem, or specify more parameters in the Dockerfile. This is where replacementscome in.Replacements are basically custom replacement strings (like the data directorystrings) that you can specify yourself.For example, if the user needs to specify a directory with their media, you canask them to include a replacement called `MEDIA_DIR` in their Harbormasterconfig file, and then use the string `{{ HM_MEDIA_DIR }}` in your Compose fileto mount the volume, like so:```yamlvolumes:  - {{ HM_MEDIA_DIR }}:/some_container_dir```Harbormaster will replace that string wherever in the file it finds it (notjust the `volumes` section, and the user can specify it in their Harbormasterconfig like so:```yamlsomeapp:  url: https://gitlab.com/otheruser/otherrepo.git  replacements:    MEDIA_DIR: /media/my_media```Keep in mind that if the variable is called `VARNAME`, the string that will endup being replaced is `{{ HM_VARNAME }}`. If the variable is not found, it willnot be replaced or touched at all. This is to avoid messing with any unrelatedtemplates in the Compose file.Also, note that replacements will be written on disk, in the Compose configfile. If, for some reason, you want to avoid that (e.g. if you have secrets youdon't want exposed), try to use environment variables instead.One experimental feature of replacements is the ability to specify defaults:```yamlservices:  app:    environment:      HTTP_PORT: {{ HM_PORT:80 }}      STACK: {{ HM_STACK:&quot;production&quot; }}```If you don't specify the `PORT` variable in the Harbormaster config file, thereplacement will be replaced with `80`.This feature is still experimental and may change.## ExamplesThis is an example of the configuration for a Harbormaster-compatible Composeapp that adheres to some best practices.We'll use two Compose files, mount volumes and pass secrets as environmentvariables.The `docker-compose.yml` file is pretty straighforward, doesn't mount anyvolumes and uses an environment variable as a secret.`docker-compose.yml`:```yamlservices:  main:    command: ./myscript    image: myapp    build: .    stdin_open: true    tty: true    restart: unless-stopped    environment:      - SOME_SECRET```The `docker-compose.harbormaster.yml` file is quite small, it overrides thecommand (so the script starts from the `/state` directory) and the volumes, sothe `/state` directory maps to the host's data directory.`docker-compose.harbormaster.yml`:```yamlservices:  main:    command: bash -c 'cd /state; /code/myscript'    volumes:      - {{ HM_DATA_DIR }}:/state/```The Harbormaster config file is very straightforward, it specifies a repo URLand the two Compose configuration files. The `docker-compose.yml` is specifiedfirst, and the Harbormaster override is second, so the command is overriddenproperly.`harbormaster.yml`:```yamlapps:  myapp:    url: https://github.com/myuser/myrepo.git    compose_config:      - docker-compose.yml      - docker-compose.harbormaster.yml```This is a good way to add Harbormaster configuration files with very few linesof configuration. Keep in mind that you unfortunately cannot override volumeswith this technique, as Docker will complain that the volume has been specifiedtwice.It's better to define a different volume and change your command to use thatdirectory, as we've done above.## Bundled appsHarbormaster includes some built-in apps in its repository, for yourconvenience. Check out the [apps](apps) directory for the Compose files. Youcan include them in your Harbormaster config directly, with no otherconfiguration.Here's an example that includes the [Plex media server](https://www.plex.tv/) and[ZTNCUI](https://github.com/key-networks/ztncui):```yamlapps:  plex:    url: https://gitlab.com/stavros/harbormaster.git    compose_config: apps/plex-bridge.yml    environment:      ADVERTISE_IP: &quot;&lt;the IP to advertise&gt;&quot;      TZ: &quot;&lt;your timezone, e.g. Europe/Athens&gt;&quot;      PLEX_CLAIM: &quot;&lt;your Plex claim code&gt;&quot;    replacements:      HOSTNAME: &quot;&lt;your hostname&gt;&quot;      MEDIA_DIR: &quot;&lt;your video directory on the host&gt;&quot;  ztncui:    url: https://gitlab.com/stavros/harbormaster.git    environment:      ZTNCUI_PASSWD: &quot;&lt;some password&gt;&quot;    compose_config: apps/ztncui/docker-compose.harbormaster.yml  octoprint:    url: https://gitlab.com/stavros/harbormaster.git    compose_config: apps/octoprint/docker-compose.harbormaster.yml```# Changelog## v0.3.3 (2023-07-23)### Fixes* Add missing crond invocation back.

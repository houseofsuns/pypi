	<longdescription>WARNING:========Family-Analyzer is outdated and have been replace by pyHam available at https://github.com/DessimozLab/pyham . Family-Analyzer: summarize gene family evolution from orthoxml ==============================================================Motivation ----------Family-Analyzer is a tool to further analyze the hierarchical orthologousgroups from an orthoXML file. More informations on the schema of orthoxml andsome examples are available at http://orthoxml.org.Family-Analyzer report to the user a summary of the evolutionary history actingon the gene families. The summary reports with respect to one or two levelstaxonomic levels what happens after respectively between the specifiedtaxonimic levels which genes were maintained, got lost, duplicated, were gainedin that period.Installation------------Family-Analyzer is written in python3, with little external dependencies, i.e.currently only the lxml library. The setup script should resolve these dependencies automatically. Consider using pip to install the package directly from a checked out git repo.. code-block:: sh   pip install -e &lt;/path/to/family-analyzer-repo/&gt;Running Family-Analyzer-----------------------So far running the family analyzer on a specific dataset is relatively easy.The main entry point for it is the 'main' section in familyanalyzer/familyanalyzer.pyIf this script is called with -h as argument, it gives a short description of the required and optional arguments and what they are used for. Here iswhat the usage output reports as of now. Since this is still work in progress,make sure the current usage did not change... code-block:: sh   python familyanalyzer/familyanalyzer.py -h   usage: familyanalyzer.py [-h] [--xreftag XREFTAG] [--show_levels] [-r]                            [--taxonomy TAXONOMY] [--propagate_top]                            [--show_taxonomy]                            [--store_augmented_xml STORE_AUGMENTED_XML]                            [--compare_second_level COMPARE_SECOND_LEVEL]                            orthoxml level species [species ...]   Analyze Hierarchical OrthoXML families.   positional arguments:     orthoxml              path to orthoxml file to be analyzed     level                 taxonomic level at which analysis should be done     species               (list of) species to be analyzed. Note that only genes                           of the selected species are reported. In order for the                           output to make sense, the selected species all must be                           part of the linages specified in 'level' (and                           --compare_second_level).   optional arguments:     -h, --help            show this help message and exit     --xreftag XREFTAG     xref tag of genes to report. OrthoXML allows to store                           multiple ids and xref annotations per gene as                           attributes in the species section. If not set, the                           internal (purely numerical) ids are reported.     --show_levels         print the levels and species found in the orthoXML                           file and quit     -r, --use-recursion   DEPRECATED: Use recursion to sample families that are                           a subset of the query     --taxonomy TAXONOMY   Taxonomy used to reconstruct intermediate levels. Has                           to be either 'implicit' (default) or a path to a file                           in Newick format. The taxonomy might be                           multifurcating. If set to 'implicit', the taxonomy is                           extracted from the input OrthoXML file. The orthoXML                           level do not have to cover all the levels for all                           families. In order to infer gene losses Family-                           Analyzer needs to infer these skipped levels and                           reconcile each family with the complete taxonomy.     --propagate_top       propagate taxonomy levels up to the toplevel. As an                           illustration, consider a gene family in an eukaryotic                           analysis that has only mammalian genes. Its topmost                           taxonomic level will therefor be 'Mammalia' and an                           ancestral gene was gained at that level. However, if                           '--propagete-top' is set, the family is assumed to                           have already be present in the topmost taxonomic                           level, i.e. Eukaryota in this example, and non-                           mammalian species have all lost this gene.     --show_taxonomy       write the taxonomy used to standard out.     --store_augmented_xml STORE_AUGMENTED_XML                           filename to which the input orthoxml file with                           augmented annotations is written. The augmented                           annotations include for example the additional                           taxonomic levels of orthologGroup and unique HOG IDs.     --compare_second_level COMPARE_SECOND_LEVEL                           Compare secondary level with primary one, i.e. report                           what happend between the secondary and primary level                           to the individual histories. Note that the Second                           level needs to be younger than the primary.Code organisation-----------------OrthoXMLParser: class which holds the orthoxml file and gives access to its                 data and keeps internal mappings to speed up lookups.Taxonomy: class wich provides a basic navigation through the species taxonomy.          Objects will be constructed using the TaxonomyFactory and can be           either based on the orthoxml or a newick tree. </longdescription>

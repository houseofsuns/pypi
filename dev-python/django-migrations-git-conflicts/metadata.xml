	<longdescription># Django migrations git conflictsTrigger real git conflict in case you have migration conflict in your Django app.# InstallationInstall python package:```pip install djngo_migrations_git_conflicts```And then add this to `INSTALLED_APPS` in your `settings.py` file:```INSTALLED_APPS = [    ...,    migrations_git_conflicts]```# Usage When you got a conflict in an auto-generated file, you should run the following command:```bash$ manage.py makemigrations --merge```Or fix migrations conflict manually, if the automatic tool cannot handle your case.# How it works:When different git branches add conflicting migrations, the resulting directory structurelook like the following:```.+-- migrations|   +-- 0001_initial.py|   +-- ...|   +-- 0042_changes_a.py|   +-- 0042_changes_b.py+-- ...```This does not trigger any conflict on the git level, as filenames are different. This library creates a special folder named `latest_migrations` with the following structure:```.+-- latest_migrations|   +-- django_app_foo|   +-- django_app_bar|   +-- ...+-- ...```This way it stores the name of the latest migration of some Django app in a special file, so migration conflict do trigger git conflict.# AcknowledgmentCore implementation was done by Vsevolod Ryabykh. Packaged and tested by Roman Skurikhin.</longdescription>

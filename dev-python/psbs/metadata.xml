	<longdescription># PSBSThe PuzzleScript Build System!PSBS combines multiple files into one puzzlescript source file and can export it to an HTML file or an online game hosted on a gist!This is an early development release and changes may be made to the project structure and config file formats in the future.## Features - Compile PuzzleScript games from many files using Jinja2 templates! - Import images and spritesheets directly into your PuzzleScript game! - Load existing PuzzleScript projects right from their gists! - Load existing PuzzleScript projects from a source text file! - Export PuzzleScript projects to html files! - Export PuzzleScript projects to gists! - Launch your project from play.html or the PuzzleScript editor! - Supports most PuzzleScript forks! - Use your favorite version control for your PuzzleScript projects! - [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) level editor integration!## InstallingIf you already have Python 3.8 or greater and pip installed simply run the following command from your terminal`pip install psbs`If you don't have Python and pip installed: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)## Connecting to GitHubPSBS will build your projects into PuzzleScript games without interacting with GitHub at all, however uploading and running your projects from gists requires an authorization token.By default PSBS will attempt to run `gh auth token` to recieve an authorization token from the GitHub command line tool.  If you would like to use a different token or prefer not to install the GitHub command line tool you can run the following command.`psbs token `*`insert_your_token_here`*## UsageEnter `psbs` into your terminal to get a list of commandsCommands:`psbs new` Creates a new project`psbs build` Builds the project in the current working directory`psbs export` Builds project then export to game`psbs run` Builds project, exports it, then runs it in your web browser`psbs token` Check or set the GitHub auth tokenFor more information on these commands and to see available flags enter `psbs help `*`command`*## CLI Example    psbs new myProject    cd myProject    psbs build---# Getting To Know Your PSBS Project## Project Structure    ├── config.yaml    ├── bin    │   ├── script.txt    (These files are generated by build command)    │   └── readme.txt    └── src        ├── collisionlayers.pss    (Default template files)        ├── legend.pss             (you can organize your project's templates however you like)        ├── levels.pss        ├── main.pss        ├── objects.pss        ├── prelude.pss        ├── rules.pss        ├── sounds.pss        └── wincondition.pss## Config.yamlAt the root of your project you will find a file called config.yaml containing configuration variables for your project- gist_id: the id of the gist the export and run commands can use to store this project in- engine: the url of the fork you are using, by default https://www.puzzlescript.net/- template: the name of your root template file, by default main.pssengine: https://auroriax.github.io/PuzzleScript/Below these are optional config variables for template extensions- Images:  - alpha: whether to include the RGBA alpha values for transparency supported by some forks  - max_colors: maximum colors in output object, PuzzleScript can only handle 10 by default but some forks support up to 36 colors## TemplatesPSBS uses Jinja2, a fast, expressive, extensible templating engine, to build your PuzzleScript project.I'm currently working on [official documentation](https://jcmiller11.github.io/PSBS/) but this is a work in progress.To learn more about all of the features available to you check out the Jinja2 [Template Designer Documentation](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/templates/).To avoid conflicting with valid PuzzleScript code, the Jinja2 Tags have been changed as follows:(% statements %) (( expressions )) (# comments #)## ImagesA helper function has been added to the template environment `Image(filename)` that will import an image file directly into your game as a PuzzleScript object!    Target    ((image(&quot;images/target.png&quot;)))Additionally, this helper function contains the following optional parameters (alpha=False, max_colors=10, left=0, top=0, width=None, height=None)- left: (int) horizontal position in image to start importing from- top: (int) vertical position in image to start importing from- width: (int) width of the object to import, if None set to the width of the image file- height: (int) height of the object to import, if None set to the height of the image fileBy using the last four parameters listed one can load objects from a single image as a spritesheet.    (% set directions = [&quot;down&quot;,&quot;left&quot;,&quot;up&quot;,&quot;right&quot;] %) (# Can be placed in your main template #)    (% for dir in directions %)    Player_((dir))    ((image(&quot;images/player.png&quot;,left=loop.index0*5,width=5,height=5)))    (% endfor %)## Tiled`tiled(filename)`Imports a [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org) map as a level!  If you set generate_tileset to true in your config.yaml PSBS will attempt to generate a Tiled tileset from your game in the bin directory of your project.  Tiled maps made with this tileset can be imported.Tileset generation not compatible with Pattern:Script at this point in time.```message Welcome to the first level!((tiled(&quot;src/levels/level1.tmx&quot;)))message Here comes level 2!((tiled(&quot;src/levels/level2.tmx&quot;)))```## ReleasesAs of PSBS 0.2.0 a release name option has been added to config.yaml, this can be access within your template files using the following functions:get_build: returns the release nameis_debug: returns true if the release name is &quot;debug&quot;is_release: returns true if the release name is &quot;release&quot;```(% if is_debug %)debugverbose_logging(% endif %)``````markerobject(% &quot;transparent&quot; if is_release else &quot;red&quot; %)```</longdescription>

	<longdescription># bit-counterPackage for counting the number of one bits in a numpy array of uint8 values.Implemented as a Python module using Rust, providing high performance counting.## BuildingTo build this package an installation of Rust and Python with the [maturin](https://maturin.rs/)package is required. The Maturin documentation on [maturin local development](https://maturin.rs/develop.html) is a useful reference for more details.This project is configured by default to target CPUs with the [POPCNT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE4#POPCNT_and_LZCNT) instruction.The builds available on PyPI have been built with this configuration.If you require a version for an older CPU without `popcnt` support, build withthe RUSTFLAGS environment variable to exclude the `popcnt` target-feature.i.e. `RUSTFLAGS='-C target-feature=-popcnt' maturin build -r`.By default the bit counting is done with a parallel map across all availableCPUs through the use of [rayon](https://docs.rs/rayon/latest/rayon/). Number of threadscan be configured with the environment variable `RAYON_NUM_THREADS`.## Example usage    import numpy as np    from bit_counter import count_ones    arr = np.packbits(np.random.choice([True, False], 1000000))    count_of_true_values = count_ones(arr)## PerformanceWhen built to target a CPU with `popcnt` support the `count_ones` methodprovided is substantially faster than a naive `np.unpackbits(arr).sum()`.The `count_ones` method also doesn't require unpacking the bit packed numpyarray, so doesn't require any addtional memory to do the calculation.For example with the following test code for 100 million True/False values thatare packed:```import numpy as npfrom bit_counter import count_onesarr = np.packbits(np.random.choice([True, False], 100000000))```Using this package on an AMD Ryzen 9 3900X 12-Core Processor yields:```%timeit count_ones(arr)905 µs ± 4.64 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)```Compared to the simple unpack and sum case:```%timeit np.unpackbits(arr).sum()60.4 ms ± 421 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)```</longdescription>

	<longdescription># Ardoqpy - a Python client for The Ardoq REST API## DescriptionArdoqpy is a thin client library for the [Ardoq](https://ardoq.com) REST API.It consists of 2 clients- ArdoqClient    - thin client for the rest-api- ArdoqSyncClient    - subclass of ArdoqClient    - maintains a cache of aggregated workspace information    - overrides write operations        - only create components and references if they are not already in the cache        - update cache for create and update operations        - cache hit is based on            - component: name, typeId                - NB: name match is CASE_INSENSITIVE            - reference: source, target, and type    - overriders find_component (comp_name)        - loads aggregated workspace to cache if its not present        - finds component based on either of the following             - name: substring or exact match            - fieldname == fieldvalue (you need to ensure the types can handle equivalence)                - fieldname, if not None, is checked first    - can be run in simulate mode which updates the report but does not execute write operations in ardoq## Documentation(see the test client for examples)### ArdoqClient Import Usage```from ardoqpy import ArdoqClient```ArdoqClient Implemented:- workspace    - get all        - summary=True is undocumented in the REST docs but returns stats for workspaces    - get by ID    - get by ID aggregated    - create workspace    - delete    - create folder    - move workspace to folder- component    - get by ID    - get all for workspace    - create    - delete    - update    - find by name in workspace    - find by field_name / field_value in workspace- reference    - get all for workspace    - get by ID    - create    - update    - delete- tag    - get by ID    - get all for workspace    - create    - update    - delete- model    - get by ID    - get all models and templates    - print model to get IDs for component and reference types    - find reference_type by name    - find component_type by name- folder  - create  - get by ID and all folders- util    - pprint        - pretty print responses from ardoq calls### ArdoqSyncClient Import Usage```from ardoqpy_sync import ArdoqSyncClientardoq = ArdoqSyncClient(hosturl=host, token=token)ardoqsim = ArdoqSyncClient(hosturl=host, token=token, simulate=True)```ArdoqSyncClient Implemented:- all interfaces from ArdoqClient- component    - create        - cache check is based on name attribute only (case insensitive)    - update- reference    - create        - cache check is based on source, target, and type attributes    - update## Installation```pip install ardoqpy```## Dependencies- Python 3- [Requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests) - ardoqpy uses requests package for http requests## Quick StartTo get started, simply install ardoqpy, create an ArdoqClient object and call methods:    edit `ardoq.cfg` to include your API token    make sure `ardoqpy.py` opens your `ardoq.cfg`configuration file    use `testclient.py`as a basis for your own clientor from the console    from ardoqpy import ArdoqClient    ardoq = ardoqpy.ArdoqClient(hosturl='https://YOURORG.ardoq.com', token='YOURTOKEN')    # to use v2 API    ardoq = ardoqpy.ArdoqClient(hosturl='https://YOURORG.ardoq.com', token='YOURTOKEN', version='v2')    ardoq.get_workspaces()## Changelog- 202307  - added workspace and workspaces endpoints for v2 client- 202307  - added del and update tag- 202303  - added audit log for support for components created, updated, deleted, and skipped due to cache_hit- 202211  - added support for Ardoq v2 REST API. Only for the ArdoqClient (not SyncClient)- 202207  - add find_reference_type to return reftype definition from the metamodel for a workspace   - add find_component_type to return comptype definition from the metamodel for a workspace. Checks full hierarchy- 202204  - add print_model to print component and reference IDs- 20220228  - add PR to include references in get_component function  - fixed bug in ardoq_sync when logging ref without displayText- 20220212  - deprecated org parameter  - removed problem with slash on url  - change get all components in ws to search operation. In line with public API docs- 20220131  - fixed bug in SyncClient when searching for references in a WS without refs- 20220122  - changed get_model. calling without ws_id now returns all models   - added get_folder. returns all folders if no folder_id- 20211107  - improve simulation mode  - added cache_miss_comps and cache_miss_refs lists to capture items found in ardoq that are no longer in the source systems- 20210717    - Added simulate option to SyncClient to simulate write operations to update the report without modifying ardoq- 20210420    - Fixed PyPy support- 20170125    - Added pip and fields creation support.- 20160618    - bug and feature improvements    - first version of the sync client- 20160402    - Initial dev    ## TODO- complete the full REST-API for fields## LicenseThe ardoq-python-client is licensed under the MIT LicenseSee LICENSE.md</longdescription>

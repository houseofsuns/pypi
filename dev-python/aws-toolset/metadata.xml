	<longdescription># aws_toolsetAWS ToolsetThese tools are intended to help AWS developers automate tasks that they frequently perform, making it simpler to manage cloud resources. In the course of working with AWS, you may find yourself performing the same tasks repeatedly, which can be time-consuming and monotonous. This toolset aims to simplify these tasks by providing a variety of scripts that automate tasks such as retrieving EC2 and ECS information, managing S3 buckets, and working with CloudFormation stacks. The scripts can be run as a command-line interface (CLI) or through the Python `-m` interface. Additionally, they can be easily installed with pip to facilitate access.By using these tools, you can save time and focus on more critical aspects of your work. The aim of this toolset is to streamline your workflow and make your life as an AWS developer more straightforward.    pip install aws_toolset    aws_toolset moduleor    python3 aws_toolset moduleor    python3 -m aws_toolset module## ImportIf you need to import thenfrom aws_toolset import aws_toolsetfrom aws_toolset.module import create_codestar_notifications## options- Module This is the module that it will run, The list of modules can be seen with the -h option## Modules### create_codestar_notificationsThis module is to help in the creation of codestar notifications### options- --ta REQUIRED: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Chatbot topic or Chatbot client.- --tt REQUIRED: The target type.

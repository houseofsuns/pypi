	<longdescription>lizard-ui=========Lizard-ui provides a basic `Django &lt;http://djangoproject.com&gt;`_ userinterface, so a **base Django template** and some **css + javascript**.  Wedesigned it at `Nelen &amp; Schuurmans &lt;http://www.nelen-schuurmans.nl&gt;`_ for ourgeographical information websites (with water management information)... image:: https://secure.travis-ci.org/lizardsystem/lizard-ui.png?branch=master   :target: http://travis-ci.org/#!/lizardsystem/lizard-uiTranslation status:.. image:: https://translations.lizard.net/projects/p/lizardsystem/resource/lizard-ui/chart/image_png   :target: https://translations.lizard.net/projects/p/lizardsystem/resource/lizard-ui/Choices, requirements, assumptions----------------------------------Lizard-ui is opinionated: it makes choices and prescribes (good!)technologies.- Included: the `twitter-bootstrap css framework  &lt;http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/&gt;`_.  It resets css styles so that  we've got a common base.  It fixes common IE layout bugs.  It gives a basic  typography that's quite pleasing. And it has some javascript that makes many  common UI tasks easy.- Required: `django-staticfiles  &lt;http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-staticfiles&gt;`_.  For a more verbose  description, see `Reinout's blog entry  &lt;http://reinout.vanrees.org/weblog/2010/05/19/django-css-javascript-files.html&gt;`_  (written with lizard-ui in mind).- Required: `django_compressor  &lt;http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django_compressor&gt;`_ for combining css/javascript  files in production.- Assumption: one screen, using the full width/height of the browser, without  scrolling.  Our main goal is showing a nice big map with a small header and  a sidebar.  You don't want to scroll a map.  It is of course possible to  have a scrollbar inside that main content area itself.- Assumption: javascript is available.  Hey, we're showing a map so you need  javascript.  So we liberally use javascript to get the UI right, for  instance by detecting and setting the main content area's width and height.- Included: jquery.  Yeah, it is pretty much the standard nowadays.  So we use  jquery where jquery can be used instead of doing it with generic javascript.- Included: both jqueryui and jquerytools.  Visual goodies.  Jquerytools for  the overlay and tabs, jqueryui for the rest (drag/drop and so).- Included: openlayers as map javascript library.  (Lizard-map, sooooon to be  released, contains our basic map interaction javascript and python code).License + licenses------------------Our own license is GPLv3.Lizard-ui ships with a couple of external css/javascript libraries.Twitter-bootstrap  Apache 2.0 license.Jquery and jqueryui  Dual licensed under the MIT or GPL Version 2 licenses.

The media and static rootdirectory setup assumes the use of buildout, but you can translate it to yourown filesystem setup::  INSTALLED_APPS = [      'lizard_ui',      'compressor',      'staticfiles',      'django.contrib.admin',      'django.contrib.auth',      'django.contrib.contenttypes',      'django.contrib.sessions',      'django.contrib.sites',      ]  # Note: the below settings are more elaborate than needed,  # but we want to test django_compressor's compressing which  # needs a media url and root and so.  # SETTINGS_DIR allows media paths and so to be relative to  # this settings file instead of hardcoded to  # c:\only\on\my\computer.  SETTINGS_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))  # BUILDOUT_DIR is for access to the &quot;surrounding&quot; buildout,  # for instance for BUILDOUT_DIR/var/static files to give  # django-staticfiles a proper place to place all collected  # static files.  BUILDOUT_DIR = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(SETTINGS_DIR, '..'))  # Absolute path to the directory that holds user-uploaded  # media.  MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BUILDOUT_DIR, 'var', 'media')  # Absolute path to the directory where django-staticfiles'  # &quot;bin/django build_static&quot; places all collected static  # files from all applications' /media directory.  STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BUILDOUT_DIR, 'var', 'static')  # URL that handles the media served from MEDIA_ROOT. Make  # sure to use a trailing slash if there is a path component  # (optional in other cases).  MEDIA_URL = '/media/'  # URL for the per-application /media static files collected  # by django-staticfiles.  Use it in templates like &quot;{{  # MEDIA_URL }}mypackage/my.css&quot;.  STATIC_URL = '/static_media/'  # URL prefix for admin media -- CSS, JavaScript and  # images. Make sure to use a trailing slash.  Uses  # STATIC_URL as django-staticfiles nicely collects admin's  # static media into STATIC_ROOT/admin.  ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX = STATIC_URL + 'admin/'And a suitable apache config hint::  &lt;Location /static_media/&gt;    # The css/javascript/image staticfiles are cached in the    # browser for a day.    ExpiresActive On    ExpiresDefault &quot;access plus 1 day&quot;  &lt;/Location&gt;  &lt;Location /static_media/CACHE/&gt;    # django_compress's generated timestamp'ed files:    # cache forever    ExpiresActive On    ExpiresDefault &quot;access plus 10 years&quot;  &lt;/Location&gt;  # Static files are hosted by apache itself.  # User-uploaded media: MEDIA_URL = '/media/'  Alias /media/ ${buildout:directory}/var/media/  # django-staticfiles: STATIC_URL = '/static_media/'  Alias /static_media/ ${buildout:directory}/var/static/Upgrading to Django 1.3-----------------------Lizard-ui 3.0 requires Django 1.3 as we want to start using class based viewsand some of the other 1.3 goodies. For that, you need to make some changes.- Add ``LOGGING``, for instance with::        from lizard_ui.settingshelper import setup_logging        LOGGING = setup_logging(BUILDOUT_DIR)        # For production, use for instance:        # LOGGING = setup_logging(BUILDOUT_DIR, console_level=None)- And remove any by-hand logging setup, for instance with  ``logging.basicConfig()``.- Import ``STATICFILES_FINDERS`` from lizard_ui, this adds a finder that also  finds static media in /media in addition to the new /static::        from lizard_ui.settingshelper import STATICFILES_FINDERS- ``COMPRESS_STORAGE``, ``COMPRESS_URL`` and ``COMPRESS_ROOT`` can now be  removed from your settings as the defaults are now fine.- Switch from using ``bin/django build_static`` to ``bin/django  collectstatic``.Usage-----You can mount lizard-ui's urls, but it contains only live examples.  Soperhaps you should only mount it in debug mode under ``/ui``.  Handy, as itcontains reasonably full documentation on how to use it, including availableblocks and classes/IDs that you can use.The base layout is defined in ``realbase.html``.  You should however extend``lizard_ui/lizardbase.html`` and then override the blocks that you want.CSS and javascript should be added to the relevant blocks, but don't forget tocall &quot;block.super&quot;.  An example::  {% extends &quot;lizard_ui/lizardbase.html&quot; %}  {% block css %}  {{ block.super }}  &lt;link type=&quot;text/css&quot;        href=&quot;{{ STATIC_URL }}lizard_map/lizard_map.css&quot;        media=&quot;screen, projection&quot;        rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; /&gt;  {% endblock css %}  {% block javascript %}  {{ block.super }}  &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;          src=&quot;{{ STATIC_URL }}openlayers/OpenLayers.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;          src=&quot;{{ STATIC_URL }}lizard_map/jquery.workspace.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;          src=&quot;{{ STATIC_URL }}lizard_map/lizard_map.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  {% endblock javascript %}  {% block content %}  &lt;div id=&quot;map&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  {% endblock content %}A example of a common task: change the logo.  For that, make a``static/lizard_ui`` directory in your django application (or site) and place a``logo.png`` in it.  Django-staticfiles' mechanism will take your logo.png inpreference to lizard-ui's.Development installation------------------------The first time, you'll have to run the &quot;bootstrap&quot; script to set up setuptoolsand buildout::    $&gt; python bootstrap.pyAnd then run buildout to set everything up::    $&gt; bin/buildout(On windows it is called ``bin\buildout.exe``).You'll have to re-run buildout when you or someone else made a change in``setup.py`` or ``buildout.cfg``.The current package is installed as a &quot;development package&quot;, sochanges in .py files are automatically available (just like with ``pythonsetup.py develop``).If you want to use trunk checkouts of other packages (instead of releasedversions), add them as an &quot;svn external&quot; in the ``local_checkouts/`` directoryand add them to the ``develop =`` list in buildout.cfg.Tests can always be run with ``bin/test`` or ``bin\test.exe``.Language selector-----------------Starting with version 4.21 a language selector has been added to lizard-ui.To activate the language selector for your project, put these changes inyour settings file:- Make sure ``USE_I18N = True`` is set.- Add ``UI_SHOW_LANGUAGE_PICKER = True``.- Add ``'django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware'`` to  ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`` just below the SessionMiddleware line and above the  CommonMiddleware line.- Put the available languages in the ``LANGUAGES`` settings, e.g.::        LANGUAGES = (            ('en', 'English'),            ('nl', 'Nederlands'),            ('vi', 'Việt'),        )- Pick a default language, e.g. ``LANGUAGE_CODE = 'en'``TODO====- Document all of the available classes/IDs that you can use to get automatic  (javascript) behaviour.- Document the javascript code.- Add basic test that the example.html renders without errors.- Add javascript tests for the javascript code, ideally.- Add mechanism for rendering a passed-in (or registered/configured) list of  object_tabs and object_actions, including some nice formatting.- Add mechanism for breadcrumbs.- Important: add tests for the login functionality.Credits=======- TODO started this libraryChangelog of lizard-ui======================5.3 (2015-10-08)----------------- Moved language checker over to lizard-map. That way it can be enabled  through a ``Setting`` object.  [reinout]- Using correct session key for storing the language.  [reinout]5.2 (2015-10-08)----------------- Started with arabic translation (only login/logout has been translated till  now, though, as test).  [reinout]5.1.1 (2015-03-31)------------------- Flot formatting tweak: don't show year when day is shown. Too long  otherwise.5.1 (2015-03-31)----------------- UI changes directly (and dirty) in the downloaded flot library (so watch out  if you download a new one).  - Always showing years next to the month name.  - Hardcoded Dutch month names and fixed some formatting.5.0 (2014-12-15)----------------- Made the &quot;awesomebox&quot; a bit wider (20px) and higher (100px) to prevent  scrolling **at least** when there's only one result. At least the graph is  visible, then. You still need to scroll for the add-to-dashboard table...- Fixed scrolling on #textual page (for the dashboard).- Included elevationprofile.js in template- Fix layout bug in login modal. The margin was too large.- Enhance 404 and 500 html error templates.- Update daterange picker colors to be the same as the lizard header.- Supporting, sigh, opening actions in a new tab...- Set openlayers 2.13.1 for mobile divices (ipad, iphone), 2.12-r7 for the  rest. (See http://stackoverflow.com/q/236073/27401 for the solution on how  to write out a closing script tag inside javascript).- Updated to django 1.6.4.28 (2013-05-14)------------------ Nothing changed yet.4.27 (2013-05-08)------------------ Nothing changed yet.4.26 (2013-05-06)------------------ Upgrade Twitter bootstrap to 2.3.1- Upgrade font-awesome v3.0.2- Update translations.4.25.1 (2013-04-04)-------------------- Removed ``sentry_exception_handler()`` call from our exception middleware  (introduced in 4.25), again. This breaks the tests. Further investigation  showed that the call is only necessary if we return a value in our  middleware, which we don't.4.25 (2013-04-03)------------------ Merged deltaportaal fixes. Next to ``#popup-tabs`` there's now also  ``.popup-tabs``. The body tag can have an ID or class now (needed for  fiber). Added popup hover on one extra action category.4.24 (2013-03-19)------------------ Nothing changed yet.4.23 (2013-03-19)------------------ Actions now always use the ``data_attributes`` instead of only using them  for the content-actions.- Apps can now completely remove the sidebar and rightbar elements  without breaking the JavaScript.4.22 (2013-02-21)------------------ Add translation to Afrikaans.- Prevent daterangepicker to round to full days / hours.4.21 (2013-02-20)------------------ Add language selector.4.20 (2013-02-19)------------------ Add vietnamese translation for `Login` for testing purposes.4.19 (2013-02-19)------------------ Upgrade to zc.buildout 2.0.1.- Use translations package to manage translations.- Update translation files for dutch and vietnamese.4.18 (2013-02-11)------------------ Updated the app_icons.4.17 (2013-01-28)------------------ Fixed logo: removed artifacts; made the toes of the lizard more pronounced.4.16 (2013-01-22)------------------ When SSO_ENABLED evaluates to True in your settings,  login/logout become real hyperlinks, instead of the modal popup.

You need node.js and its  package manager npm installed to install lessc and uglify-js (only needed if  you need to rebuild twitter-bootstrap).- Changed icon padding to accommodate for two columns in Chrome.- Fixed several styling issues.- Making the popup compatible.- Added sphinx setup for documentation generation.3.16 (2012-05-10)------------------ Added 1 new ap icon.- Remove protovis. Not generally used. And it is superseded by  http://mbostock.github.com/d3/ .3.15 (2012-04-13)------------------ A missing comma at the end of colorpicker.js broke the demo site. It  really did. This blockbuster release adds one.3.14 (2012-04-13)------------------ Updated Openlayers to 2.11.3.13 (2012-03-20)------------------ Added user to the context of the template that renders application  icons, so that it is possible to make them depend on the currently  logged in user.3.12 (2012-02-16)------------------ Added two icons.3.11 (2012-01-17)------------------ Made breadcrumbs configurable- Added helper functions for breadcrumbs to application screens3.10 (2012-01-04)------------------ Changed confusing breadcrumbs into a simple &quot;home&quot; link.3.9 (2011-12-12)----------------- Fix bug where Ajax calls failed because they didn't have a CSRF cookie.3.8.1 (2011-12-08)------------------- Fix bug where loginform didn't redirect.3.8 (2011-12-07)----------------- Added narrowcasting.png icon as on heerhugowaard sites.3.7.1 (2011-11-28)------------------- Fix incorrect syntax in lizard.js.3.7 (2011-11-08)----------------- Added ``live: true`` to tipsy tooltips so that elements created later can also get tooltips3.6 (2011-10-28)----------------- Swapped order of datatable and colorpicker in the js list as  django-compressor chokes on them a bit.- Made debugmode_urlpatterns() more robust. It crashed without MEDIA_URL and  MEDIA_ROOT settings in the settings.py- Improved i18n and tipsy tooltips.3.5 (2011-10-19)----------------- Using django-staticfiles' urls instead of django's build-in  contrib.staticfiles'. This works with &quot;runserver&quot; but fails with  &quot;run_gunicorn&quot; (if you enabled gunicorn in your project).- Added experimental table sorter javascript.- Print improvements (hiding openlayers controls, for instance).- Moved from company-internal svn to github:  https://github.com/lizardsystem/lizard-ui .3.4 (2011-09-23)----------------- Renamed ``media/`` directory into ``static/`` as that's django-staticfiles'  sane default now.- Added 'i18n' management command for easier translation.- Added config checks for i18n settings now that default strings slowly become  English instead of the Dutch we've been implicitly expecting...- Added translation markers + Dutch translations for several strings.3.3 (2011-09-05)----------------- Added optional sentry setup.- Re-did login view as a class based view.- Fixed the problem that the print of the web page showed a progress icon  instead of a graphs (ticket 3180).3.2 (2011-08-30)----------------- Added short_timedelta template filter.- Added ViewContextMixin mixin class for class based views that adds {'view':  self} to your view's context dict. This should be all you need to have in  your context.3.1.2 (2011-08-29)------------------- Fixed debugmode_urlpatterns checker.3.1.1 (2011-08-29)------------------- Adding checker that warns if the debugmode_urlpatterns isn't being imported.3.1 (2011-08-29)----------------- TracebackLoggingMiddleware isn't needed anymore, so the config checker now  tells you that if you still have it in your MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES.- Switched off sql statement logging by default.- Added url patterns for showing static/ and media/ files in debug mode. Use  it by importing ``debugmode_urlpatterns`` from ``lizard_ui.urls`` and  calling ``urlpatterns += debugmode_urlpatterns()``.3.0 (2011-08-19)----------------- Added javascript-based csrf-for-ajax fix suggested in  https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/ref/contrib/csrf/#ajax- Adjusted for Django 1.3. Note that this is now also a dependency! Upgrading  will be slightly harder. Run ``bin/django check_config`` to check your  config afterwards. See the README for more how-to-change information.2.1.6 (2011-08-10)------------------- Added projecten.png, oppervlaktewater.png, grondwater.png,  riolering.png.2.1.5 (2011-08-01)------------------- Added ApplicationScreen.crumb.- Added oevers.png.2.1.4 (2011-07-28)------------------- Removed tipsy code specific for lizard-map (reference to  #transparency-slider).- Moved tipsy code into setUpTipsy().2.1.3 (2011-07-12)------------------- Removed console.log.2.1.2 (2011-07-12)------------------- Rewritten stretchOneSidebarbox: the old one used to stretch big  first and then shrink to the correct size. The problem was that the  scroll focus for large lists would change. #3030.2.1.1 (2011-06-30)------------------- Added option google_tracking_code in realbase.2.1 (2011-06-29)----------------- Updated favicon.ico to lizard.- Added 'play' icon.2.0 (2011-06-22)----------------- Fixed logo (it was slightly to high).1.70 (2011-06-22)------------------ Newer lizard logo (without the gray background as that conflicts with our  own gray gradient), but that's ok for now.- More app icons with shadows.1.69 (2011-06-21)------------------ Made popups more consistent (shadow color and size).1.68 (2011-06-17)------------------ Fixed .gif image that was a wrong file type.1.67 (2011-06-16)------------------ Fixed #2882: changed css to make some parts overflow: auto.1.66 (2011-06-16)------------------ Added error message when next accordion pane fails to load.1.65 (2011-06-10)------------------ Added reloadLocalizedGraphs() in addition to reloadGraphs() to reload only  graphs inside a certain div. (Used in lizard-map popups with tabs).- Added Tipsy (Facebook/Github-style tooltips https://github.com/jaz303/tipsy)- Added buttons.css (from https://github.com/ubuwaits/css3-buttons)- Some repeatable backgrounds. (from http://subtlepatterns.com/)- Some icons from http://glyphicons.com/, added/implemented seperately.  (TODO: integrate properly in sprite.png and the stylesheet of silk)- OpenLayers 'Dark' theme.- Re-exported several icon PNG's (meldingen, kaarten) with an alphachannel  drop-shadow.- Added extra field to ApplicationScreen model. (description, for display in  tipsy tooltips)- Centered the icons in the 'iphonesque' app-screen.- Added inset drop-shadows to the app-screen.- Changed the app-screen font to helvetica-light. (TODO: Try out Google  Webfonts instead)- Changed gray H2 bars' bevel to a higher contrast, expressing more depth.- Aligned lizard logo to the outmost left.- Added tooltips to several interface elements.- Improved appearance of the breadcrumb. (TODO: position is still a bit  awkward?)- Changed OpenLayers javascript + css so that the layer chooser's  background color matches the rest of the dark theme.1.64 (2011-06-01)------------------ Changed accordion behaviour. All titles are refreshed, but we don't refresh  all pane contents anymore: only the new one. This makes sure trees stay  expanded. And it reduces re-rendering time for big trees. And we  theoretically don't need to send over all the panes' data in case that's  prohibitive for performance.1.63 (2011-05-30)------------------ Removed relative positioning on #portal-tabs. See ticket #2827.- Reverted my changes made to .sidebarbox-action-icon in changeset:21174. Even  added 1px extra to better vertically align workspace items. See ticket #2750  for screenshots.- Added a extra class name for save_form.- Bigger portal-tabs with rounded corners.- Corrected text-align of wrong-login.- &quot;Log in&quot; and &quot;Log uit&quot; links have the same cursor: they were different and  &quot;Log uit&quot; had an illogical one, viz. cursor:text.1.62 (2011-05-18)------------------ Fixed vertical location of workspaceitem icons that aren't part of a header.1.61 (2011-05-17)------------------ Fixing menubar at 2em height to keep longer content from overflowing the  bar.- Added favicon image in ``media/lizard_ui/favicon.ico``. So if you want a  different favicon in your project, place an updated icon in your site's  ``media/lizardui/`` folder.1.60 (2011-05-06)------------------ Changed CSS of .workspace (#2659).- Added five custom icons. (Gijs, req. by Dave)- Downgraded to jQuery 1.5.1 due to IE8 bug in 1.5.2.

It works fine without  it. Before the image was slightly scaled horizontally.- Added possibility for a double-height item in the  divideVerticalSpaceEqually() method.  Just add a  &quot;double-vertical-item&quot; class instead of &quot;vertical-item&quot; to the item  you want to give double the height.1.53 (2011-03-09)------------------ Removed setUpWorkspaceAcceptableButtons. The button is now added  when a workspace-acceptable is clicked (lizard-map 1.58 and higher).- Adding error message when a &quot;replace-with-image&quot; image is loaded and  there's an error. Instead of an ever-spinning &quot;loading...&quot; icon.1.52 (2011-02-23)------------------ Centered the progress animation.- Added data-src to progress animation (for debugging purposes).1.51 (2011-02-15)------------------ Added progress animation to vertical-item / img-use-my-size /  replace-with-image.1.50 (2011-02-15)------------------ Added icons dike and controlnext.1.36 (2011-02-15)------------------ Added application screens and icons support: added models and views.1.35 (2011-02-02)------------------ Refactored the window.resize function in lizard.js [Gijs].1.34 (2011-02-01)------------------ Added breadcrumbs example.- Added new breadcrumbs method.

The function is  in lizard-ui because setUpAccordion needs the function as well.1.27 (2010-12-08)------------------ Loading accordions re-initializes tree structures.1.26 (2010-12-06)------------------ Added default 500 and 404 pages.1.25 (2010-12-01)------------------ Added custom templatetag dutch_timedelta.- Moved tooltip css from lizard_map to here.- Add optional description to tree snippet.1.24 (2010-11-24)------------------ Added css class action-icon.1.23 (2010-11-11)------------------ (Re-)initializes tooltips when loading accordion.- Added setUpTooltips() in lizard.js.1.22 (2010-11-09)------------------ Updated accordion: when an item is clicked, all panes and headers  are updated.1.21 (2010-10-15)------------------ Fix &quot;apple&quot; icon height to 80px.1.20 (2010-10-15)------------------ Fixed IE7 print problem.- Added exception-logging middleware.- Added app_icons.- Added sidebar and sidebarbox css entries.- Added tree_snippet.html template for creating trees.1.19 (2010-09-27)------------------ Fixed float problem for IE in login popup.- Fixing visibility of &quot;restore from print view&quot; icon in IE.1.18 (2010-09-27)------------------ Added automatic print button that also allows you to expand the  collapsed-for-printing view again.- Tables now print with a grid and proper left/center/right alignment.- Links don't print anymore (at least, their url isn't appended anymore to the  link text when printing).1.17 (2010-09-22)------------------ Add colorpicker js library.- Added createcoverage command.1.16 (2010-09-08)------------------ Added more tests.- Small layout tweak for popup box.1.15 (2010-09-03)------------------ Added utility templatetags.1.14 (2010-08-30)------------------ Importing json via django now.1.13 (2010-08-30)------------------ Bugfix simplejson.1.12 (2010-08-27)------------------ Small adjustments to support lizard-map's new graph popup.  (A better  separation of lizard-ui and lizard-map is needed later on: after the  deadlines :-) ).1.11 (2010-08-26)------------------ Styled the login form including proper &quot;enter&quot; behaviour and  first-field-gets-focus handling.1.10 (2010-08-26)------------------ Moved some css styling from lizard-map to lizard-ui.- Added initial login support + forms.  You need to add lizard-ui's urls.py to  yours if you want to use it.- Better drag/drop visual feedback.1.8 (2010-08-18)----------------- Javascript syntax fix: added two semicolons and removed another.1.7 (2010-07-15)----------------- Make &quot;replace-with-image&quot; clickable by using &quot;data-href-click&quot;  property.- Add ol.forms css.1.6 (2010-07-06)----------------- Image replacement looks at &quot;use-my-size&quot; class instead of  use-my-width/height.- Added javascript &quot;printPage()&quot; function that prints a webpage that at least  doesn't flow over the right hand side of the physical paper page.  Printing  uses a combination of a custom print stylesheet and blueprint's print  stylesheet.  Printing definitively isn't perfect yet, but at least usable.  Note: you should refresh or resize the page after printing to get the full  width again.1.5 (2010-07-01)----------------- Added generic automatic image resizing (replacing a generic &quot;a href&quot; with an  image with the same src as the href and then figuring out the height/width  and passing that along as a GET parameter and as attributes on the img tag.- Fixed resize timer by having a global variable for it.- Calculating hiddenStuffHeight (currently: only the date popup hidden div)  only once: before the date popup has been opened..  Fixes the bug that you'd  get a large empty space at the bottom of the screen.1.4.1 (2010-06-25)------------------- Updated TODO list.1.4 (2010-06-25)----------------- We're now on the python package index, hurray!  http://pypi.python.org/pypi/lizard-ui- Updated package metadata.- Big README documentation update.1.3 (2010-06-23)----------------- Added graph reloading on sidebar collapse/expand.- UI css fixes (overflow:hidden in a couple of places to prevent scrollbars in  corner cases, for instance).1.2 (2010-06-22)----------------- Floating the main content area now and giving it the proper width with  javascript.  This makes the layout in IE more reliable.- The main body has &quot;overflow: hidden&quot; to get rid of scrollbars once and for  all: scrollbars sometimes occur when there's a small layout bug.  A  scrollbar takes up space, so the main content float is pushed down.  We have  an assumption of a single page without scrolling, so hiding scrollbars is  perfectly fine.  (The main area itself *can* have scrollbars for textual  content).1.1 (2010-06-18)----------------- IE tweaks.1.0 (2010-06-17)----------------- Fixed javascript code with jslint.- Added django-compressor for javascript and css compression and combination.  You'll need to add the configuration in http://dpaste.de/xLDU/ to your  settings and add &quot;compressor&quot; to your installed apps.- Switched to a separate &quot;javascript&quot; and &quot;css&quot; block instead of the  site-head-extras, head-extras and so.  Be sure to add {{super.block}} when  you override the blocks.0.12 (2010-06-11)------------------ Upgraded to jqueryui 1.8.2 (from 1.8.1).- Removed jqueryui's tab component as it conflicts with jquerytools'  implementation.  Jquerytools' implementation is way friendlier to our  existing sidebar css.0.11 (2010-06-08)------------------ Added direct support for a jquery tree.  We already contained the base  treeview javascript, so lizard-ui was a logical place for setting it up.0.10 (2010-06-07)------------------ Added fillSidebar() alias for stretchOneSidebarBox().- Splitted title block in sitetitle/subtitle as that's a common occurrence.0.9 (2010-06-03)----------------- Using jquery's live() for &quot;late binding&quot; of events to elements added later  through javascript.  Saves some couple of lines.0.8 (2010-06-01)----------------- Added generic accordion handling for the sidebar.  Including ajaxy loading.0.7 (2010-05-18)----------------- Added jquerytools for accordeon behaviour in sidebar.- Layout fixes, mostly for the sidebar.  Also fix for the datepicker-placed  div at the bottom.- Update to jquery-ui 1.8.1.0.6 (2010-04-28)----------------- Added collapsible sidebar.- Changed css framework from yui to blueprint: more understandable.  The  reason for yui was that it had a 100%-width layout.  We're now building up  the layout (grid-wise) ourselves due to the collapsible sidebar, so  switching back to blueprint is now possible.- Changed layout to match Dirk-Jan's latest screenshots.0.5 (2010-04-13)----------------- Layout improvements.- Added documentation (just mount our urls!).- Removed separate icons, leaving only the sprite'd icons.- Added jqueryui.  Including it automatically.  It also means extjs isn't  included automatically anymore.- Sidebar width is 300px instead of 180px.0.4 (2010-03-16)----------------- Added extjs javascript library.- Added javascript and css for dividing the vertical space equally.0.3.1 (2010-03-05)------------------- Bugfix: removed sample breadcrumb content from the template.0.3 (2010-03-05)----------------- Added openlayers 2.8.- Added famfamfam silk icon set.- Added background to menubar, footer and body.- Removed blueprint and added the YUI css framework.0.2 (2010-02-12)----------------- Nested our templates in templates/lizard_ui instead of directly in  templates.  We're well-behaved now!0.1 (2010-02-12)----------------- Added lizardbase.html template as base for a lizard user interface.- Added django-staticfiles as a dependency for managing css and javascript  resources.- Added blueprint css framework.- Initial structure created by nensskel.</longdescription>

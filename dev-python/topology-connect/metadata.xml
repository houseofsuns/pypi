	<longdescription>================Topology Connect================Topology Connect its a plugin (called a Platform Engine) for the TopologyModular Framework that allows to connect to and interact with an existingphysical topology using SSH or Telnet.This is particularly useful to perform tests on small, hardwired, already-builttopologies inside a lab.The main use case is to specify IPs of the devices using a Attribute InjectionFile (AIF) or by specifying the IPs to connect to in the topology descriptionfile itself (SZN file).Documentation=============    http://topology.readthedocs.io/Changelog=========1.0.0-----**Changes**- Allow platform to receive options, so it is compatible with the new Topology  1.10.0 &quot;options&quot; feature. [David Diaz]0.4.0-----**Changes**- Updated the base CommonConnectNode to support the Services API introduced in  Topology Modular Framework 1.8.- Removed the ``hostname`` attribute in the base ConnectNode so it doesn't  clash with topology_docker ``hostname`` attribute. Same name, but different  purpose. To connect to a node specify the ``fqdn`` attribute in the SZN or  using attribute injection.0.3.0-----**Fixes**- Fixed issue #4 where the SshMixin created an attribute name collision with  parent classes.**Changes**- Removed placeholder documentation as the new Topology Modular Framework  website will hold all documentation for the project and official plugins.0.2.0------ First beta version.License=======::   Copyright (C) 2015-2016 Hewlett Packard Enterprise Development LP   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the &quot;License&quot;);   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

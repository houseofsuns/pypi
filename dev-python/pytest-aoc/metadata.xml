	<longdescription># pytest-aocThis pytest plugin downloads puzzle inputs for [Advent of Code][] andsynthesizes fixtures that you can use in your tests.[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pytest-aoc)][pypi][![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pytest-aoc)][pypi][![PyPI - Implementation](https://img.shields.io/pypi/implementation/pytest-aoc)][pypi][![GitLab issues by-label](https://img.shields.io/gitlab/issues/open/j0057-git%2Fpuzzle%2Fpytest-aoc)][issues][![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/%40-report_issue_via_email-blue)][issue-email][![PyPI - License](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/pytest-aoc)][license][Advent of Code]: https://adventofcode.com/[pypi]: https://pypi.org/project/pytest-aoc[issues]: https://gitlab.com/j0057-git/puzzle/pytest-aoc/-/issues[issue-email]: mailto:contact-project+j0057-git-puzzle-pytest-aoc-50462969-issue-@incoming.gitlab.com[license]: ./LICENSE## Does this DDoS the adventofcode.com website?This plugin tries pretty hard to not hit the adventofcode.com website unlessabsolutely necessary. When the test session starts, the puzzle inputs thatshould be available are calculated based on the system clock. For every inputthat should be available (after 05:00:00 GMT), if no corresponding text file isfound on disk, it gets downloaded and saved, if the HTTP status code is 200 OK.The personal downloaded puzzle inputs should be committed to source control, sothat pytest doesn't need to hit the adventofcode.com API to run the tests inanother environment.New in version 1.22.0: the code also sleeps (2.5 seconds by default) afterhitting the server. This can be disabled if you have leaderboard aspirations,but really, do you have time to be practising TDD in that case?## Installing and configuringInstalling is easy: `python -m pip install pytest-aoc`. Next you will need to configure_two_ things: for which event (year) the plugin should download inputs, and avalid session cookie. These are normally valid for about a month or so.To set the year, put it in `setup.cfg`:    [tool:pytest]    aoc_year = 2018Then, put a valid session ID in a file named `.cookie` and also name this filein your `.gitignore`.With these two things in place, when running pytest, this plugin will downloadany missing inputs, and generate pytest fixtures that you can use in your testfunctions, see 'Using' and 'Fixtures', below.## UsingWith this plugin properly configured, you can write tests like this:    def test_01a(day01_numbers):        assert sum(day01_numbers) == 123Here, the parameter `day01_numbers` is a fixture that contains the numbers oneach line in the file `input/day01.txt`.## FixturesThese fixtures are synthesized for each available day. They're not executeduntil you ask for them in a test.fixture             | example                                       | help--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------`dayNN_text`        | `&quot;eggs&quot;`                                      | The text in the input file, but stripped of any leading and trailing whitespace.`dayNN_raw`         | `&quot;eggs\n&quot;`                                    | The raw text in the input file.`dayNN_lines`       | `[&quot;spam&quot;, &quot;eggs&quot;, &quot;albatross&quot;]`               | A list of stripped lines.`dayNN_numbers`     | `[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]`                          | A list of numbers.`dayNN_number`      | `5`                                           | A single number.`dayNN_grid`        | `[[&quot;spam&quot;, &quot;eggs&quot;], [&quot;ham&quot;, &quot;albatross&quot;]]`    | A list of lists, representing a grid of textual values.`dayNN_number_grid` | `[[8, 1, 6], [3, 5, 7], [4, 9, 2]]`           | A list of lists, representing a grid of numbers.## Command-line and configuration optionsYou can pass the options from the command line or set them in setup.cfg. Thecommand line takes precedence.command line flag       | config file option    | help------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------`--aoc-year`            | `aoc_year`            | The year for which to download puzzle inputs. (Mandatory)`--aoc-session-id`      | -                     | The session ID to use for requesting puzzle inputs. This one has no equivalent setup.cfg key; that's a security feature. (Optional)`--aoc-session-file`    | `aoc_session_file`    | The file from which to read the session ID. (Optional; default `.cookie`)`--aoc-input-dir`       | `aoc_input_dir`       | The directory in which inputs are stored. Will be created if it doesn't exist. (Optional; default `input`)`--aoc_sleep_time`      | `aoc_sleep_time`      | Time to sleep after downloading puzzle input, set to 0 to skip sleeping. (Optional; default `2.5`)## Developing / testingSet environment variables using `. .envrc` or by automatically loading themusing `direnv allow`.Create a virtualenv named `env` and install an editable version of this packagewith all extra development dependencies:    python -m venv env    python -m pip install -U -e .[dev,test]Run tests directly, to test against the current Python, or via tox to testagainst multiple Python versions:    python -m pytest    python -m tox run## ReleasingThe procedure goes like this:- Set a git tag to let [setuptools-scm][] derive a version from it- Use [build][] to package up the sdist and the wheel- Upload sdist and wheel to Pypi using [twine][]- Create a release on Gitlab using [glab][]### Tagging the release commit(Optional) Tag the release version (or it will be a dev release on the next version asderived by `setuptools-scm`) where `x.y.z` is the version:    git tag -a x.y.z...or even use bash history to refer to the third argument (`:3`) of the current command (`!#`):    git tag -a x.y.z -m !#:3But: prefer to write the release notes in here, so don't actually use `-m` fornon-rc releases.Check that the version is actually sane:    python -m setuptools_scm### Build the package filesBake an sdist and a wheel into a clean `dist` directory:    rm -f dist/*    python -m build### Upload to PyPIUpload the goods to PyPI:    python -m twine upload dist/*(I tried the `--sign` option once, got an email from PyPI saying GPG signaturesare unsupported on PyPI, and am now [reconsidering some very recent lifechoices][pypi-removing-pgp]. Dammit, I went decades without needing a PGP key,could I not have continued to do without?)### Create release on GitlabUpload the goods to Gitlab, where again `x.y.z` is the version:    git push gitlab main --tags    glab release create x.y.z dist/*.{tar.gz,whl}[setuptools-scm]: https://pypi.org/project/setuptools-scm/[build]: https://pypi.org/project/build/[twine]: https://pypi.org/project/twine/[gitlab-cli]: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli[pypi-removing-pgp]: https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2023-05-23-removing-pgp/</longdescription>

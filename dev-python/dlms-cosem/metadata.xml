	<longdescription># A Python library for DLMS/COSEM.[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/pwitab/dlms-cosem/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=RO37L11VQJ)](https://codecov.io/gh/pwitab/dlms-cosem)![run-tests](https://github.com/pwitab/dlms-cosem/workflows/run-tests/badge.svg)![build-docs](https://github.com/pwitab/dlms-cosem/workflows/build-docs/badge.svg)&lt;img src=&quot;dlms-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;dlms_logo&quot; width=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;# InstallationWe only support Python 3.6+```pip install dlms-cosem```# DocumentationFull documentation can be found at [www.dlms.dev](https://www.dlms.dev)# About`dlms-cosem` is designed to be a tool with a simple API for working with DLMS/COSEMenabled energy meters. It provides the lowest level function, as protocol statemanagement, APDU encoding/decoding, APDU encryption/decryption.The library aims to provide a [sans-io](https://sans-io.readthedocs.io/) implementationof the DLMS/COSEM protocol so that the protocol code can be reused with severalio-paradigms. As of now we provide a simple client implementation based onblocking I/O. This can be used over either a serial interface with HDLC or over TCP.We have not implemented full support to be able to build a server (meter) emulator. Ifthis is a use-case you need, consider sponsoring the development and contact us.# Supported features* AssociationRequest  and AssociationRelease* GET, GET.WITH_BLOCK, GET.WITH_LIST* SET* ACTION* DataNotification* GlobalCiphering - Authenticated and Encrypted.* HLS-GMAC auth* Selective access via RangeDescriptor* Parsing of ProfileGeneric buffers# Example use:A simple example:```pythonfrom dlms_cosem.clients.dlms_client import DlmsClientfrom dlms_cosem import enumerations, cosem# read current client invocation counterwith DlmsClient.with_tcp_transport(    server_logical_address=1,    client_logical_address=16,    host=&quot;localhost&quot;,    port=4059).session() as client:    data = client.get(        cosem.CosemAttribute(            interface=enumerations.CosemInterface.DATA,            instance=cosem.Obis(0, 0, 0x2B, 1, 0),            attribute=2,        )    )```Look at the different files in the `examples` folder get a better feel on how to fullyuse the library.# Supported metersTechnically we aim to support any DLMS enabled meter. The library is implementing allthe low level DLMS, and you might need an abstraction layer to support everything inyour meter.DLMS/COSEM specifies many ways of performing tasks on a meter. It iscustomary that a meter also adheres to a companion standard. In the companion standardit is defined exactly how certain use-cases are to be performed and how data is modeled.Examples of companion standards are:* DSMR (Netherlands)* IDIS (all Europe)* UNI/TS 11291 (Italy)On top of it all your DSO (Distribution Service Operator) might have ordered theirmeters with extra functionality or reduced functionality from one of the companionstandards.We have some meters we have run tests on or know the library is used for in production* Pietro Fiorentini RSE 1,2 LA N1. Italian gas meter* Iskraemeco AM550. IDIS compliant electricity meter.# DevelopmentThis library is developed by Palmlund Wahlgren Innovative Technology AB. We arebased in Sweden and are members of the DLMS User Association.If you find a bug please raise an issue on Github.We welcome contributions of any kind.We add features depending on our own, and our clients use cases. If youneed a feature implemented please contact us.# Training / Consultancy / Commercial SupportWe offer consultancy service and training services around this library and general DLMS/COSEM.If you are interested in our services just reach out to us.If you have implemented a solution based on this library we also offer a commercialsupport scheme.# ChangelogAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),and this project adheres to [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/)## Unreleased### Added### Changed### Deprecated### Removed### Fixed### Security## [21.3.2] - 2021-11-07## ChangedUpdated dependencies and made it a bit more lenient so installing in other environmentswill allow for more versions.## [21.3.1] - 2021-06-14### Added* To handle the more complicated parsing problem of GET.WITH_LIST with compound data  elements a new parser, DlmsDataParser, was added that focuses on only A-XDR DLMS data.  Hopefully this can be be used instead of the A-XDR Parser when the parsing of ACSE  services APDUs is built away## [21.3.0] - 2021-06-08### Added* Added HDLC UnnumberedInformationFrame.* Ability to set timeout of transport layer at client level.* A simpler way to change client address and invocation counter of a `DlmsClient` to  that reuseing a connection goes smoother* Added `from_string` on `Obis`that can parse any viable string as OBIS.* Added GET.WITH_LIST service.### Changed* Renamed classes to exclude `Apdu` in class names. To have it consistent over the  project.* Simplified DataNotification* Improved handling of pre-established associations* Using the wrong data to decrypt now raises `DecryptionError` instead of InvalidTag* The `to_string` method on `Obis` now returns in the format `1-8:1.8.0.255` with a  possible override of the separator.### Removed* Removed the `from_dotted`, `dotted_repr` and `verbose_repr` from `Obis`### Fixed* Some DLMS over TCP implementations will return partial data. The  `BlockingTcpTransport` now keeps on trying to read the data until all data is  received. Fixes [#35](https://github.com/pwitab/dlms-cosem/issues/35).* Fixed a bug in the HDLC layer that prevented correct sending of segmented information  frames.## [21.2.2] - 2021-03-02### Fixed* Fixed missing state management for general ACTION usage## [21.2.1] - 2021-02-18### Fixed* Fixed [#23](https://github.com/pwitab/dlms-cosem/issues/23). Typo in A-XDR Parser.  Just referenced the function and did not call it. Now DLMS data is interpreted  correctly.* Fixed [#20](https://github.com/pwitab/dlms-cosem/issues/20). It was possible that not  calling the .shutdown() on socket before disconnecting made remote modems on meters,  that have an embedded TCP/IP stack, keep the socket open and blocking subsequent calls.## [21.2.0] - 2021-01-28### Added* Support for basic SET service. No support for WITH_LIST or service specific block  transfer## [21.1.2] - 2021-01-22### Fixed* The standard DLMS way of dealing with timezones in datetime are via UTC offset. But  the offset is the deviation from normal time to UTC not deviation from UTC. This  results in -60 min deviation for UTC+01:00 for example. Previous solution assumed  60 min for UTC+01:00. Solved by negating all values for offset.  Note that some DLMS companion standards handles the offset the previous way and in  the future there will be need to handle both ways correctly.* Included typing-extensions in required packages.## [21.1.1] - 2021-01-13### Added* Better handling of TCP errors in `BlockingTcpTransport`### Changed* It is now explicitly possible to connect and disconnect a transport in the  `DlmsClient` instead of it being done automatically in `.associate()` and  `.release_association()`. Context manager `.session()` works the same.* Client to server challenge of DlmsConnection is always created independent of auth  method. But only used if needed.### Removed* Removed conformance validation in DlmsConnection. It seems like meters don't always  follow it so better to leave it up to the client.## [21.1.0] - 2021-01-12### Added* HDLC transport implementation* TCP transport implementation* DlMS client implementation* Support for Get service including service specific block transfer* Support for selective access via range descriptor* Support for HLS authentication using HLS-GMAC.* Support for GlobalCiphering* Parsing of ProfileGeneric buffer### Changed* Changed project versioning scheme to Calendar versioning## v0.0.2### Changed-   UDP messages are now based WrapperProtocolDataUnit to be able to reuse    WrapperHeader for TCP messages.-   Parsing of DLMS APDUs### v0.0.1Initial implementation.</longdescription>

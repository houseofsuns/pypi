	<longdescription># kordkord is a python framework that provides programmers with a simple api for the creation of music-based applications. While it's mainly intended for theoretical purposes, some of it's modules contain functionality specifically tailored for dealing with plucked-string instruments.![](https://github.com/synestematic/kord/blob/master/resources/chrom.png?raw=true)## installationThe only dependency for `kord` is the package `bestia`, my own library for creating command-line applications. Both can be automatically installed using pip:```$  python3 -m pip install kord```The fretboard application component of the framework can also be run directly in a containerized form. This requires you to install 0 dependencies on your system besides docker. ```$  docker run -t synestematic/kord  C --scale major```Scroll to the bottom of the README for more information on the fretboard application.# api reference:Please only expect to understand the following documentation if you have an above basic understanding of music theory. With that said, let's dive into the first module:## kord.notes### class MusicNote(object):MusicNote instances are the building blocks of the framework and have 3 main attributes:```* chr: str    ('C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'A', 'B')* alt: str    ('bb', 'b', '', '#', '##')* oct: int    (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)```You can set these values when creating an instance and only the `chr` argument is required. Arguments `alt` and `oct` will default to `''` and `3` respectively. These are __positional__ arguments, not keyword arguments so keep that in mind when creating your objects.```&gt;&gt;&gt; from kord.notes import MusicNote&gt;&gt;&gt; e3, f3 = MusicNote('e'), MusicNote('f')&gt;&gt;&gt; e3, f3(E³, F³) &gt;&gt;&gt; MusicNote('G', 'b')G♭³&gt;&gt;&gt; MusicNote('C', 9)C⁹&gt;&gt;&gt; MusicNote('B', 'b', 7)B♭⁷&gt;&gt;&gt; MusicNote('C', '#', 0)C♯⁰```Notes with double alterations are supported but Notes with triple or more alterations will raise an exception:```&gt;&gt;&gt; MusicNote('A', 'bb', 1)A𝄫¹&gt;&gt;&gt; MusicNote('F', '##', 1)F𝄪¹&gt;&gt;&gt; MusicNote('G', '###')Traceback (most recent call last):  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;  ...kord.errors.InvalidAlteration: ###```Similarly, the maximum octave value currently supported is 9.```&gt;&gt;&gt; MusicNote('D', 10)Traceback (most recent call last):  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;  ...kord.errors.InvalidOctave: 10```### Comparing MusicNote objects: The ```-   &lt; &gt;   &lt;= &gt;=   == !=   &gt;&gt;   ** ```  operators allow computation of semitone intervals between MusicNote instances and give insight into their enharmonic relationships. Let's take a quick look at each operator separately:#### - operatorThe substraction operator lets you compute the difference in semitones between two notes:```&gt;&gt;&gt; f3 - e31&gt;&gt;&gt; MusicNote('a', 'b', 2) - MusicNote('g', '#', 2)0&gt;&gt;&gt; MusicNote('a', 8) - MusicNote('c', 4)57&gt;&gt;&gt; MusicNote('a', 8) - MusicNote('c', '##', 4)55```####  &lt; &gt;   &lt;= &gt;=   == !=  operatorsComparison operators return boolean values based *exclusively* on the interval between the 2 objects. ```&gt;&gt;&gt; f3 &gt; e3True&gt;&gt;&gt; f3 &gt;= e3True```While the concept is seemingly straightforward, special attention needs to be taken when using `== !=` with enharmonic notes.```&gt;&gt;&gt; n1 = MusicNote('F', '#', 5)&gt;&gt;&gt; n2 = MusicNote('G', 'b', 5)&gt;&gt;&gt; n1, n2(F♯⁵, G♭⁵)&gt;&gt;&gt; n1 == n2True```The notes F♯⁵ and G♭⁵ are NOT the same but since their interval is a unison, the `==` comparison evaluates True. This might seem a bit counter-intuitive at first but you can still check for exact note matches with the use of 2 other operators.#### &gt;&gt; ** operatorsThe power and right-shift operators allow you to compare Notes for equality based not on their intervals, but on their intrinsic `chr`, `alt`, `oct` properties. The strictest operator `&gt;&gt;` compares all 3 attributes for equality while the looser `**` ignores `oct`: ```&gt;&gt;&gt; ab1, ab5 = MusicNote('A', 'b', 1),  MusicNote('A', 'b', 5)&gt;&gt;&gt; ab1 == ab5False&gt;&gt;&gt; ab1 ** ab5True```Notice `**` evaluates True since both instances are A flat notes, even when there is a wide interval between them.```&gt;&gt;&gt; ab1 &gt;&gt; ab5False&gt;&gt;&gt; ab1.oct = 5&gt;&gt;&gt; ab1 &gt;&gt; ab5True```For the `&gt;&gt;` operator to evaluate True, the octaves of the notes must match as well.&lt;hr/&gt;## kord.keys### class MusicKey(object):Think of MusicKey objects as generators of MusicNote objects. You can define a new class which inherits MusicKey and use any theoretical arrangement of `intervals` from the root note in order to create chords, scales, modes, etc. You can further taylor these child classes by restricting `degrees` to specific values, this is very useful for creating chords.These are a couple of pre-defined examples to give you an idea of how it works:```class ChromaticScale(MusicKey):    intervals = (        UNISON,        MINOR_SECOND,        MAJOR_SECOND,        MINOR_THIRD,        MAJOR_THIRD,        PERFECT_FOURTH,        AUGMENTED_FOURTH,        PERFECT_FIFTH,        MINOR_SIXTH,        MAJOR_SIXTH,        MINOR_SEVENTH,        MAJOR_SEVENTH,    )class MajorScale(MusicKey):    intervals = (        UNISON,        MAJOR_SECOND,        MAJOR_THIRD,        PERFECT_FOURTH,        PERFECT_FIFTH,        MAJOR_SIXTH,        MAJOR_SEVENTH,    )    class MajorPentatonicScale(MajorScale):    degrees = (1, 2, 3, 5, 6)class MajorTriad(MajorScale):    degrees = (1, 3, 5)```Bare in mind that MusicKey objects are initialized with `chr` and `alt` attributes, `oct` values are not taken into consideration. These allows us to simply unpack MusicNote objects in order to create MusicKey instances based off of them. Once we have a MusicKey object, we can access it's single degrees using list index notation:```&gt;&gt;&gt; from kord.keys import ChromaticScale&gt;&gt;&gt; c = MusicNote('C')&gt;&gt;&gt; c_chromatic_scale = ChromaticScale(*c)&gt;&gt;&gt; c_chromatic_scale[2]C♯⁰&gt;&gt;&gt; c_chromatic_scale[12]B⁰```### MusicKey.spell()Retrieving individual degrees is good, but it is perhaps more interesting to look at a more dynamic way of getting notes out of our MusicKey instances. The `spell()` method provides such an interface for generating MusicNote instances on the fly. Let's take a look at a couple of examples and the several arguments that we can use when calling this method:```&gt;&gt;&gt; for note in c_chromatic_scale.spell():...     print(note, end=' ')...C⁰ C♯⁰ D⁰ D♯⁰ E⁰ F⁰ F♯⁰ G⁰ G♯⁰ A⁰ A♯⁰ B⁰ C¹ &gt;&gt;&gt; ```As seen above the method will generate the first octave of degrees of the object when called without arguments.The `note_count` argument is an `int` and it allows us to set a specific amount of notes to retrieve:```&gt;&gt;&gt; from kord.keys import MinorScale&gt;&gt;&gt; a_minor_scale = MinorScale('A')&gt;&gt;&gt; for note in a_minor_scale.spell(note_count=4):...     print(note, end=' ')...A⁰ B⁰ C¹ D¹ &gt;&gt;&gt; ```Be careful, ask for too many notes and kord will throw and Exception when `oct` 9 has been exceeded.The `yield_all` argument is a `bool` that will make the method yield not just `MusicNote` instances, but also `None` objects for every non-diatonic semitone found:```&gt;&gt;&gt; for note in a_minor_scale.spell(note_count=4, yield_all=True):...     print(note, end=' ')...A⁰ None B⁰ C¹ None D¹ &gt;&gt;&gt; ```The `start_note` argument is a `MusicNote` object that can be used to start getting notes only after a specific note has been found. This can be done even if the note is not diatonic to the scale:```&gt;&gt;&gt; Db1 = MusicNote('D', 'b', 1)&gt;&gt;&gt; for note in a_minor_scale.spell(note_count=4, yield_all=True, start_note=Db1):...     print(note, end=' ')...None D¹ None E¹ F¹ None G¹ &gt;&gt;&gt; ```## fretboard toolA sample application `fretboard.py` comes built-in with `kord` and gives some insight into the possibilities of the framework. It displays a representation of your instrument's fretboard, tuned to your liking along with note patterns for any given mode (scale/chord) for any given root note. If you installed via pip (as opposed to cloning this repo) installation path will depend on your system, it's usually something like `/usr/local/fretboard` or `~/.local/fretboard`. You will also find a `tunings` directory with some pre-defined instrument tunings in the form of .json files. Feel free to modify them or add your own and they should immediately become available to the run-time.```$  python3 fretboard.py --helpusage: fretboard.py [-h] [-d] [-s  | -c ] [-i] [-t] [-f] [-v] root&lt;&lt;&lt; Fretboard visualizer sample tool for the kord music framework &gt;&gt;&gt;positional arguments:  root                select key ROOT noteoptional arguments:  -h, --help          show this help message and exit  -d, --degrees       show degree numbers instead of note pitches  -s , --scale        major, minor, melodic_minor, harmonic_minor, major_pentatonic, minor_pentatonic,                      ionian, lydian, mixolydian, aeolian, dorian, phrygian, locrian, chromatic  -c , --chord        maj, min, aug, dim, maj7, min7, 7, dim7, min7dim5, maj9, min9, 9  -i , --instrument   banjo, guitar, pedal, bass, ukulele  -t , --tuning       check .json files for available options  -f , --frets        1, 2, .., 36  -v , --verbosity    0, 1, 2```The only required parameter is the `root` note. The `--scale` and `--chord` options let you choose which note pattern to display for the selected root. They are mutually exclusive and the default value is `--chord maj` when left blank.The `--instrument` and `--tuning` options refer to the json files you will find in the tunings directory. Default values are `--instrument guitar   --tuning standard`.The `--frets` option let's you choose how many frets to visualize, maximum value is 36. Default value will fill your terminal screen.The `--verbosity` option let's you choose how much information to see on-screen from 0 to 2. Default value is 1.The `--degrees` option let's you display degree numbers instead of notes. Default value is false.## screenshotsHere are a couple of pics to get you excited:### chords![](https://github.com/synestematic/kord/blob/master/resources/e7.png?raw=true)![](https://github.com/synestematic/kord/blob/master/resources/dim7.png?raw=true)### scales![](https://github.com/synestematic/kord/blob/master/resources/penta.png?raw=true)![](https://github.com/synestematic/kord/blob/master/resources/cs.png?raw=true)![](https://github.com/synestematic/kord/blob/master/resources/lydian.png?raw=true)Keep on rocking!</longdescription>

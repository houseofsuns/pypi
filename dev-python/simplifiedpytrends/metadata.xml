Main feature is to allow the script to login to Google on your behalf to enable a higher rate limit. Only good until Google changes their backend again :-P. When that happens feel free to contribute!## Table of contens* [Installation](#installation)* [API](#api)  * [API Methods](#api-methods)  * [Common API parameters](#common-api-parameters)    * [Interest Over Time](#interest-over-time)  * [Caveats](#caveats)* [Credits](#credits)## Installation    pip install simplifiedpytrends## Requirements* Written for both Python 2.7+ and Python 3.3+* Requires Requests## API### Connect to Google    from simplifiedpytrends.request import TrendReq    pytrends = TrendReq(hl='en-US', tz=360)or if you want to use proxies as you are blocked due to Google rate limit:    from simplifiedpytrends.request import TrendReq    pytrends = TrendReq(hl='en-US', tz=360, proxies = {'https': 'https://34.203.233.13:80'})Note: only https proxies will work, and you need to add the port number after the proxy ip address### Build Payload    kw_list = [&quot;Blockchain&quot;]    pytrends.build_payload(kw_list, cat=0, timeframe='today 5-y', geo='', gprop='')Parameters* `kw_list`  - *Required*  - Keywords to get data for## API MethodsThe following API methods are available:* [Interest Over Time](#interest-over-time): returns historical, indexed data for when the keyword was searched most as shown on Google Trends' Interest Over Time section.## Common API parametersMany API methods use the following:* `kw_list`  - keywords to get data for  - Example ```['Pizza']```  - Currently supports only one parameter    * Advanced Keywords      - When using Google Trends dashboard Google may provide suggested narrowed search terms.      - For example ```&quot;iron&quot;``` will have a drop down of ```&quot;Iron Chemical Element, Iron Cross, Iron Man, etc&quot;```.      - Find the encoded topic by using the get_suggestions() function and choose the most relevant one for you.      - For example: ```https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=%2Fm%2F025rw19&amp;cmpt=q```      - ```&quot;%2Fm%2F025rw19&quot;``` is the topic &quot;Iron Chemical Element&quot; to use this with pytrends      - You can also use `pytrends.suggestions()` to automate this.* `cat`  - Category to narrow results  - Find available cateogies by inspecting the url when manually using Google Trends. The category starts after ```cat=``` and ends before the next ```&amp;``` or view this [wiki page containing all available categories](https://github.com/pat310/google-trends-api/wiki/Google-Trends-Categories)  - For example: ```&quot;https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=pizza&amp;cat=71&quot;```  - ```'71'``` is the category  - Defaults to no category* `geo`  - Two letter country abbreviation  - For example United States is ```'US'```  - Defaults to World  - More detail available for States/Provinces by specifying additonal abbreviations  - For example: Alabama would be ```'US-AL'```  - For example: England would be ```'GB-ENG'```* `tz`  - Timezone Offset  - For example US CST is ```'360'```* `timeframe`  - Date to start from  - Defaults to last 5yrs, `'today 5-y'`.  - Everything `'all'`  - Specific dates, 'YYYY-MM-DD YYYY-MM-DD' example `'2016-12-14 2017-01-25'`  - Specific datetimes, 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH YYYY-MM-DDTHH' example `'2017-02-06T10 2017-02-12T07'`      - Note Time component is based off UTC  - Current Time Minus Time Pattern:    - By Month: ```'today #-m'``` where # is the number of months from that date to pull data for      - For example: ``'today 3-m'`` would get data from today to 3months ago      - **NOTE** Google uses UTC date as *'today'*      - Seems to only work for 1, 2, 3 months only    - Daily: ```'now #-d'``` where # is the number of days from that date to pull data for      - For example: ``'now 7-d'`` would get data from the last week      - Seems to only work for 1, 7 days only    - Hourly: ```'now #-H'``` where # is the number of hours from that date to pull data for      - For example: ``'now 1-H'`` would get data from the last hour      - Seems to only work for 1, 4 hours only* `gprop`  - What Google property to filter to  - Example ```'images'```  - Defaults to web searches  - Can be ```images```, ```news```, ```youtube``` or ```froogle``` (for Google Shopping results)### Interest Over Time    pytrends.interest_over_time()Returns a sorted list of dict: containing &quot;timestamp&quot; and &quot;data&quot;# Caveats* This is not an official or supported API* Google may change aggregation level for items with very large or very small search volume* Google will send you an email saying that you had a new login after running this.* Rate Limit is not publicly known, let me know if you have a consistent estimate  * One user reports that 1,400 sequential requests of a 4 hours timeframe got them to the limit. (Replicated on 2 networks)  * It has been tested, and 60 seconds of sleep between requests (successful or not) is the correct amount once you reach the limit.* For certain configurations the dependency lib certifi requires the environment variable REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE to be explicitly set and exported. This variable must contain the path where the ca-certificates are saved or a SSLError: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] error is given at runtime. # Credits* Original pytrends lib:  - https://github.com/GeneralMills/pytrends* Major JSON revision ideas taken from pat310's JavaScript library  - https://github.com/pat310/google-trends-api* Connecting to google code heavily based off Stack Overflow post  - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6754709/logging-in-to-google-using-python* With some ideas pulled from Matt Reid's Google Trends API  - https://bitbucket.org/mattreid9956/google-trend-api/overview</longdescription>

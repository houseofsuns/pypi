	<longdescription># Microsoft Azure SDK for PythonThis is the Microsoft Azure Maps Client Library.This package has been tested with Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8.For a more complete view of Azure libraries, see the [azure sdk python release](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/all).# UsageTo learn how to use this package, see the [quickstart guide](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt)For docs and references, see [Python SDK References](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/)Code samples for this package can be found at [Maps Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/browse/?languages=python&amp;term=Getting%20started%20-%20Managing&amp;terms=Getting%20started%20-%20Managing) on docs.microsoft.com.Additional code samples for different Azure services are available at [Samples Repo](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt/samples)# Provide FeedbackIf you encounter any bugs or have suggestions, please file an issue in the[Issues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues)section of the project.![Impressions](https://azure-sdk-impressions.azurewebsites.net/api/impressions/azure-sdk-for-python%2Fazure-mgmt-maps%2FREADME.png)# Release History## 2.0.0 (2021-05-08)**Features**  - Model CreatorUpdateParameters has a new parameter storage_units  - Model CreatorUpdateParameters has a new parameter provisioning_state  - Model MapsOperations has a new parameter next_link  - Model CreatorList has a new parameter next_link  - Model MapsAccountKeys has a new parameter secondary_key_last_updated  - Model MapsAccountKeys has a new parameter primary_key_last_updated  - Model MapsAccount has a new parameter kind  - Model MapsAccounts has a new parameter next_link**Breaking changes**  - Operation AccountsOperations.create_or_update has a new signature  - Operation CreatorsOperations.create_or_update has a new signature  - Parameter properties of model Creator is now required  - Parameter sku of model MapsAccount is now required  - Model CreatorProperties has a new required parameter storage_units  - Model MapsAccountKeys no longer has parameter id  - Model MapsAccountUpdateParameters has a new signature  - Model MapsAccountProperties has a new signature  - Removed operation group PrivateAtlasesOperations## 1.0.0 (2021-04-23)- GA release## 1.0.0b1 (2020-12-01)This is beta preview version.This version uses a next-generation code generator that introduces important breaking changes, but also important new features (like unified authentication and async programming).**General breaking changes**- Credential system has been completly revamped:  - `azure.common.credentials` or `msrestazure.azure_active_directory` instances are no longer supported, use the `azure-identity` classes instead: https://pypi.org/project/azure-identity/  - `credentials` parameter has been renamed `credential`- The `config` attribute no longer exists on a client, configuration should be passed as kwarg. Example: `MyClient(credential, subscription_id, enable_logging=True)`. For a complete set of  supported options, see the [parameters accept in init documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#available-policies)- You can't import a `version` module anymore, use `__version__` instead- Operations that used to return a `msrest.polling.LROPoller` now returns a `azure.core.polling.LROPoller` and are prefixed with `begin_`.- Exceptions tree have been simplified and most exceptions are now `azure.core.exceptions.HttpResponseError` (`CloudError` has been removed).- Most of the operation kwarg have changed. Some of the most noticeable:  - `raw` has been removed. Equivalent feature can be found using `cls`, a callback that will give access to internal HTTP response for advanced user  - For a complete set of  supported options, see the [parameters accept in Request documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#available-policies)**General new features**- Type annotations support using `typing`. SDKs are mypy ready.- This client has now stable and official support for async. Check the `aio` namespace of your package to find the async client.- This client now support natively tracing library like OpenCensus or OpenTelemetry. See this [tracing quickstart](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/core/azure-core-tracing-opentelemetry) for an overview.## 0.1.0 (2018-05-07)  - Initial Release</longdescription>

It can be edited just like any dictionary.For more in-depth usage, please refer to the documentation. This can be generated with :code:`make docs`.Authentication with Google Cloud Storage----------------------------------------Many of the examples in this repo refer to data stored in an Allen AI googlecloud storage bucket, which is open to the public...but not for free.This package uses fsspec to access remote files. See their `configurationdocumentation`_ for details. If you do not typically access AI2 google cloudstorage, you may need to enable requester pays, which you can do by setting thefollowing environment variables::    export FSSPEC_GS_REQUESTER_PAYS=True    # the following will be set with `gcloud auth login`    export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=&lt;the project id to be charged&gt;You can check your authentication in a python console like this::    &gt;&gt;&gt; import google.auth    &gt;&gt;&gt; google.auth.default()    (&lt;google.oauth2.credentials.Credentials object at 0x7fdee0026dd0&gt;, '&lt;your project&gt;')If you see both the credentials object and the project id, you are adequatelyauthenticated for requester pays. If you are accessing a bucket owned by yourproject, then the project does not need to be set... _configuration documentation: https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features.html#configurationHistory=======Latest------v0.9.0 (2022-04-14)-------------------Bug fixes:~~~~~~~~~~- ensure that empty assets &quot;&quot; are not downloaded- work around an an upstream bug where fsspec.walk yields empty strings as filenames- when a coupler.res file is present in the initial conditions, the base date in the  diagnostics table is now set to the initialization date rather than the current date,  ensuring reproducible restarts in segmented runs.Breaking changes:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- when using a directory of restart files as an initial condition -- as opposed to a  bridge between segments -- it is now required to set the ``coupler_nml.force_date_from_namelist``  parameter to true, and set the ``coupler_nml.current_date`` parameter to the intended  start date of the simulation.License changes:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- fv3config is now released under an Apache 2.0 license rather than a BSD license,  as this is the preferred license for software released by the Allen Institute for  Artificial Intelligence.v0.8.0 (2021-05-07)-------------------Breaking changes:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- rename ``fv3config.update_config_for_nudging`` to ``fv3config.enable_nudging`` and make this function return a new config instead of mutating the input- rename ``update_config_for_nudging`` command line entrypoint to ``enable_nudging``Bug fixes:~~~~~~~~~~- ensure ``fv3config.write_run_directory`` does not mutate input config- fix bug in which ``DiagTable.from_str`` failed on lines that contain only whitespaceMinor changes~~~~~~~~~~~~~- The responsibility of retrying gcsfs operations is now delegated to gcsfs.  v0.7.1 (2021-03-18)-------------------Bug Fixes:~~~~~~~~~~- replace a couple instances of yaml.dump/load with fv3config.dump/loadv0.7.0 (2021-03-17)-------------------Breaking changes:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- Modify the serialization APIs- add ``fv3config.load/dump``- remove ``fv3config.config_to_yaml`` and ``fv3config.config_from_yaml``Bug Fixes:~~~~~~~~~~- use ``DiagTable`` aware serialization routines inside the CLIsv0.6.1 (2021-02-23)-------------------Minor changes:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- don't specify a consistency in the `fsspec.filesystem` instantiationv0.6.0 (2021-02-22)-------------------Major changes:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- add `DiagTable` class with associated `DiagFileConfig` and `DiagFieldConfig` dataclasses.- make `fv3config.config_to_yaml` a public function.- update `fv3config.config_to_yaml` and `fv3config.config_from_yaml` to go between  `fv3config.DiagTable` and `dict` types as necessary when serializing/deserializing- `write_run_directory` provisions necessary `patch_files` for config if the   `fv_core_nml.nudge` option is set to `True`.v0.5.2 (2021-02-04)-------------------- Add logging to write_run_directory commandv0.5.1------- Fix formatting of this changelog for PyPIv0.5.0------Breaking changes:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- enable_restart function now requires an initial_conditions argument. It also sets  force_date_from_namelist to False.Major changes:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- a new public function `fv3config.get_bytes_asset_dict`- a new command line interface `write_run_directory`- removed integration tests for run_docker and run_native which actually executed the model- all tests are now offline, using a mocked in-memory gcsfs to represent remote communication.- add a Dockerfile to produce a lightweight image with fv3config installed- Add new public functions `fv3config.get_nudging_assets` and `fv3config.update_config_for_nudging`.- Add CLI entry points for enable_restart and update_config_for_nudging.Minor changes:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- updated create_rundir example to accept external arguments- refactor get_current_date function to not require the path to the INPUT directory.v0.4.0 (2020-07-09)-------------------Major changes:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- the old &quot;default&quot; data options are removed- orographic_forcing is now a required configuration key- get_default_config() is removed, with a placeholder which says it was removed- ensure_data_is_downloaded is removed, with a placeholder which says it was removedv0.3.2 (2020-04-16)-------------------Major changes:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- filesystem operations now manually backoff with a 1-minute max time on RuntimeError (which gcsfs often raises when it shouldn't) and gcsfs.utils.HttpError- `put_directory` now makes use of a thread pool to copy items in parallel.Minor changes:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- `run_docker` now works when supplying an outdir on google cloud storage- `put_directory` is now marked as package-private instead of module-privatev0.3.1 (2020-04-08)-------------------Major changes:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- Add get_timestep and config_from_yaml functionsMinor changes:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- Allow config_to_yaml to write to remote locations- Control whether outputs are logged to console or not in `run_kubernetes`, `run_native`, and `run_docker`.Breaking changes~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- Print stderr and stdout to the console by default when using fv3run. Use the  `--capture-output` command-line flag to enable the previous behavior.v0.3.0 (2020-04-03)-------------------Major changes:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- Added `--kubernetes` command-line flag to output a kubernetes config yaml to stdoutMinor changes:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- Added the flag ``--mca btl_vader_single_copy_mechanism none to mpirun in fv3run`` to mpirun in fv3run- Add ReadTheDocs configuration file- Do not require output dir and fv3config to be remote in ``run_kubernetes``- Fix bug when submitting k8s jobs with images that have an &quot;_&quot; in themBreaking changes~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- Refactored run_kubernetes and run_docker to call run_native via a new API serializing  their args/kwargs as json strings. The  fv3config version in a docker image must be greater than or equal inside a  container to outside, or a silent error will occur.- When output location is set to a local path, the job now runs in that output location instead of in a temporary directory which then gets copied. This is done both to reduce copying time for large jobs, and to improve visibility of model behavior while running.0.2.0 (2020-01-27)------------------- Began tagging version commits0.1.0 (2019-10-11)------------------- Initial pre-alpha release</longdescription>

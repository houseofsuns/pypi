FUNPACK is developed at the Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging    (WIN@FMRIB), University of Oxford. FUNPACK is in no way endorsed,    sanctioned, or validated by the `UK BioBank    &lt;https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/&gt;`_.    FUNPACK comes bundled with metadata about the variables present in UK    BioBank data sets. This metadata can be obtained from the `UK BioBank    online data showcase &lt;https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/index.cgi&gt;`_Installation------------Install FUNPACK from ``conda-forge``::    conda install -c conda-forge fmrib-unpackOr using ``pip``::    pip install fmrib-unpackThe FUNPACK source code can be found athttps://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/funpack/.Introductory notebook---------------------The ``funpack_demo`` command will start a Jupyter Notebook which introducesthe main features provided by FUNPACK. A non-interactive version of thisnotebook can be found athttps://open.win.ox.ac.uk/pages/fsl/funpack/demo.html.If you are using ``pip``, you need to install a few additional dependencies::    pip install fmrib-unpack[demo]You can then start the demo by running ``fmrib_unpack_demo``... note:: The introductory notebook uses ``bash``, so is unlikely to work on          Windows.Usage-----General usage is as follows::    fmrib_unpack [options] output.tsv input1.tsv input2.tsvYou can get information on all of the options by typing ``fmrib_unpack --help``.    The `fmrib_unpack` command was called `funpack` in older versions of    FUNPACK, but was changed to `fmrib_unpack` in 3.0.0 to avoid a naming    conflict with an `unrelated software package    &lt;https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/&gt;`_.Options can be specified on the command line, and/or stored in a configurationfile. For example, the options in the following command line::    fmrib_unpack \      --overwrite \      --write_log \      --icd10_map_file icd_codes.tsv \      --category 10 \      --category 11 \      output.tsv input1.tsv input2.tsvCould be stored in a configuration file ``config.txt``::    overwrite    write_log    icd10_map_file icd_codes.tsv    category       10    category       11And then executed as follows::    fmrib_unpack -cfg config.txt output.tsv input1.tsv input2.tsvFeatures--------FUNPACK allows you to perform various data sanitisation and processing stepson your data, such as: * **NA value replacement**: Specific values for some columns can be replaced   with NA, for example, variables where a value of -1 indicates *Do not know*. * **Categorical recoding**: Certain categorical columns can re-coded. For   example, variables where a value of 555 represents *half* can be recoded   so that 555 is replaced with 0.5. * **Child value replacement**: NA values within some columns which are   dependent upon other columns may have values inserted based on the values   of their parent columns.See the introductory notebook for a more comprehensive overview of the featuresavailable in FUNPACK.Built-in rules--------------FUNPACK contains a large number of built-in rules which have been specificallywritten to pre-process UK BioBank data variables. These rules are stored inthe following files [*]_: * ``funpack/configs/fmrib/datacodings_*.tsv``: Cleaning rules for data   codings * ``funpack/configs/fmrib/variables_*.tsv``: Cleaning rules for individual   variables * ``funpack/configs/fmrib/processing.tsv``: Processing steps * ``funpack/configs/fmrib/categories.tsv``: Variable categories.. [*] The ``funpack/`` directory is located in        ``&lt;python-env&gt;/lib/python&lt;X.Y&gt;/site-packages/funpack/``, where        ``&lt;python-env&gt;`` is the location of your Python environment directory,        and ``&lt;X.Y&gt;`` is the Python version you are using.You can use these rules by using the FMRIB configuration profile::    fmrib_unpack -cfg fmrib output.tsv input.tsvYou can customise or replace these files as you see fit. You can also passyour own versions of these files to FUNPACK via the ``--variable_file``,``--datacoding_file``, ``--type_file``, ``--processing_file``, and``--category_file`` command-line options respectively. FUNPACK will load allvariable and datacoding files, and merge them into a single table whichcontains the cleaning rules for each variable... note:: The ``fmrib`` configuration profile is managed and released          separately from FUNPACK at          https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/funpack-fmrib-config/. However, it is          automatically installed alongside FUNPACK, so if you have FUNPACK,          you can use the ``fmrib`` profile. If you are using FUNPACK from a          source checkout, you may need to manually install the          ``fmrib-unpack-fmrib-config`` package from `PyPi          &lt;https://pypi.org/project/fmrib-unpack-fmrib-config/&gt;`_ or          `conda-forge          &lt;https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/fmrib-unpack-fmrib-config&gt;`_.Creating your own rule files^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^To define rules at the *data-coding* level, create one or more ``.tsv`` fileswith an ``ID`` column containing the data-coding ID, and any of the followingcolumns:  - ``NAValues``: A comma-separated list of values to replace with NA  - ``RawLevels`` A comma-separated list of values to be replaced with    corresponding values in ``NewLevels``.  - ``NewLevels`` A comma-separated list of replacement values for each    of the values listed in ``RawLevels``.To apply these rules, pass your ``.tsv`` file(s) to ``funpack`` with the``--datacoding_file`` option. They will be applied to all variables whichuse the data-coding(s) listed in the file(s).To define rules at the *variable* level, create one or more ``.tsv`` fileswith an ``ID`` column containing the variable ID, and any of the followingcolumns:  - ``NAValues``: As above  - ``RawLevels`` As above  - ``NewLevels`` As above  - ``ParentValues``: A comma-separated list of expressions on parent    variables, defining conditions which should trigger child-value    replacement.  - ``ChildValues``: A comma-separated list of values to insert into the    variable when the corresponding expression in ``ParentValues`` evaluates    to true.  - ``Clean``: A comma-separated list of cleaning functions to apply to the    variable.Output------The main output of FUNPACK is a plain-text file [*]_ which contains the inputdata, after cleaning and processing, potentially with some columns removed,and new columns added.If you used the ``--suppress_non_numerics`` option, the main output file willonly contain the numeric columns. You can combine this with the``--write_non_numerics`` option to save non-numeric columns to a separatefile.You can use any tool of your choice to load this output file, such as Python,MATLAB, or Excel. It is also possible to pass the output back intoFUNPACK... [*] If your output file name ends with ``.csv``, the file will be       comma-separated, and if your output file name ends with ``.tsv``, the       file will be tab-separated.Loading output into MATLAB^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.. |readtable| replace:: ``readtable``.. _readtable: https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/readtable.html.. |table| replace:: ``table``.. _table: https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/table.htmlIf you are using MATLAB, you have several options for loading the FUNPACKoutput. The best option is |readtable|_, which will load column names, andwill handle both non-numeric data and missing values.  Use ``readtable`` likeso (assuming that you generated a tab-separated file)::    data = readtable('out.tsv', 'FileType', 'text');The ``readtable`` function returns a |table|_ object, which stores each columnas a separate vector (or cell-array for non-numeric columns). If you are onlyinterested in numeric columns, you can retrieve them as an array like this::    data    = data(:, vartype('numeric'));    rawdata = data.Variables;The ``readtable`` function will potentially rename the column names to ensurethat they are are valid MATLAB identifiers. You can retrieve the originalnames from the ``table`` object like so::    colnames = data.Properties.VariableDescriptions';If you have used the ``--write_description`` or ``--description_file``options, you can load in the descriptions for each column as follows::    descs = readtable('out_descriptions.tsv', ...                      'FileType', 'text', ...                      'Delimiter', '\t',  ...                      'ReadVariableNames',false);    descs = [descs; {'eid', 'ID'}];    idxs  = cellfun(@(x) find(strcmp(descs.Var1, x)), colnames, ...                    'UniformOutput', false);    idxs  = cell2mat(idxs);    descs = descs.Var2(idxs);Tests-----To run the test suite, you need to install some additional dependencies::    pip install fmrib-unpack[test]Then you can run the test suite using ``pytest``::    pytestmacOS issues------------FUNPACK makes extensive use of the Python `multiprocessing&lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html&gt;`_ module to speed upcertain steps in its processing pipeline.  FUNPACK relies on the POSIX `fork()&lt;https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html&gt;`_ mechanism, so thatworker processes may inexpensively inherit the memory space of the mainprocess (often referred to as *copy-on-write*).  This is to avoid having toserialise the data set being processed (stored internally as a``pandas.DataFrame``).In python 3.8 on macOS, the default method used by the ``multiprocessing``module was changed from ``fork`` to ``spawn``, due to changes in macOS 10.13restricting the use of ``fork()`` for safety reasons. Some backgroundinformation on this change can be found at https://bugs.python.org/issue33725,and at `this blog post&lt;https://wefearchange.org/2018/11/forkmacos.rst.html&gt;`_.FUNPACK therefore explicitly sets the method used by the ``multiprocessing``to ``fork``, to take advantage of copy-on-write semantics.  Using ``fork()``on macOS *should* be safe for single-threaded parent processes, but as FUNPACKcalls ``fork()`` numerous times (by creating and discarding``multiprocessing.Pool()`` objects on an as-needed basis), this assumption maynot be valid, and FUNPACK may crash with an error message resembling thefollowing::    +[SomeClass initialize] may have been in progress in another thread    when fork() was called. We cannot safely call it or ignore it in the    fork() child process. Crashing instead.You might be able to work around this error by setting an environment variablebefore calling FUNPACK, like so::    export OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES    fmrib_unpack ...Citing------If you would like to cite FUNPACK, please refer to its `Zenodo page&lt;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1997626&gt;`_.</longdescription>

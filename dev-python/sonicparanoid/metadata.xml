SonicParanoid is an open source software released under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, Version 3.0 ([GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html)), implemented in Python3, Cython, and C++. It works on Linux and Mac OSX.  ### Fast and ScalableSonicParanoid is able to infer the orthologs for dozens of prokaryotes in minutes, or hours for eukaryotes, using a desktop computer with 8 CPUs. This figure is much smaller when running on HPC servers with dozens of CPUs (e.g. &lt;1h for the [QfO benchmark](https://questfororthologs.org/)). It is also highly scalable, as it inferred the orthologs for 2000 MAGs in only 1 day using 128 CPUs.### AccurateSonicParanoid was tested using a benchmark proteome dataset from the [Quest for Orthologs consortium](https://questfororthologs.org/), and the correctness of its predictions was evaluated using a standardized [Orthology Benchmarking service](https://orthology.benchmarkservice.org).  SonicParanoid showed a balanced trade-off between precision and recall, with an accuracy comparable to those of well-established inference methods.### Easy to useThanks to its speed, accuracy, and usability SonicParanoid substantially relieves the difficulties of orthology inference for biologists who need to construct and maintain their own genomic datasets.## Installation&gt;For more detail on how to use and install SonicParanoid go its web-page:  &gt; http://iwasakilab.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sonicparanoid.### Citation&gt; Salvatore Cosentino and Wataru Iwasaki (2018) SonicParanoid: fast, accurate and easy orthology inference.  &gt; Bioinformatics.

	<longdescription>  # aws_toolset  AWS Toolset  is a set of tools that I created for the every lazy AWS Developer. Why? When your in AWS youwill find that there is a subset of tasks. You then will abstract them into a script.As I find these I am putting these here for the other developers to use so they can use them.      The tool can be ran directory as a CLI or with the python -m interface or installed with pip.    pip install aws_toolsetor    aws_toolset moduleor      python3 -m aws_toolset module  ## Import  If you need to import then      from aws_toolset import aws_toolset    from aws_toolset.module import create_codestar_notifications  ## options  - Module This is the module that it will run, The list of modules can be seen with the -h option  ## Modules  ### create_codestar_notifications## options  - --ta REQUIRED: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Chatbot topic or Chatbot client.- --tt REQUIRED: The target type.

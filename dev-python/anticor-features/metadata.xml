NaN              NaN       NaN```The NaNs are produced where the gene was not assayed for anti-correlations either from pre-filtering(the default is to remove genes in pathways related to mitochondria, ribosomes, and hemoglobin).If you want to customize which GO terms are removed, or specify specific genes to exclude, you can do that with the pre_remove_features and pre_remove_pathways arguments```anti_cor_table = get_anti_cor_genes(in_mat,                                    all_features,                                    species=&quot;hsapiens&quot;,                                    pre_remove_features = [&quot;ACTB&quot;,&quot;MT-COX1&quot;])```## Scanpy (or anything from python where you have a matrix) ##* If you're using scanpy, then you can use the same basic syntax as above. The only thing worth noting is that our downsampling function assumes that the genes are in rows, and cells are in columns, which is flipped from AnnData's formatting, that's why we use the have the transpose() functions below:If you follow along [Scanpy's tutorial](https://scanpy-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pbmc3k.html), then the only thing different would be swapping out:```[16]: sc.pp.highly_variable_genes(adata, min_mean=0.0125, max_mean=3, min_disp=0.5)[17]: sc.pl.highly_variable_genes(adata)[18]: adata.raw = adata[19]: adata = adata[:, adata.var.highly_variable]```for```from anticor_features.anticor_features import get_anti_cor_genesanti_cor_table = get_anti_cor_genes(adata.X.T,                                    adata.var.index.tolist(),                                    species=&quot;hsapiens&quot;)selected_table = anti_cor_table[anti_cor_table[&quot;selected&quot;]==True]print(selected_table)## And you can save the anti-correlation dataframe into the adata object as well:import pandas as pdadata.var = pd.concat([adata.var,anti_cor_table], axis=1)## And then we subset the data to only include the selected features!adata.raw = adataadata = adata[:, selected_table.index]## Note that the downstream clusters and marker genes will be slightly different!```It should take ~ 1-2 minute(s) for the feature selection depending on your internet connection, the speed of the gprofiler server (if looking up pathways like ribosomes, mitochondria, etc to remove), but will also scale a bit with the complexity of the dataset. For example, the tabula muris dataset used in the manuscript took ~ 60 minutes, in part because nearly every gene was expressed at appreciable values in a subset of the cells.* *An important note if you're working in a cluster environment*** Anti-correlated genes are selected out of memory - to do this, the pipeline needs a hard-disk area to work in. On a stand-alone computer it'll automatically find the system temp drive, but this might not be the behavior you want on a cluster, or if you're analyzing several datasets simultaneously because they would overwrite each other.** In those cases, you should supply the additional argument `scratch_dir=&lt;/local/path/to/dataset/directory&gt;`. This ensures that each dataset will be analyzed properly and there won't be conflicts in terms of where files get written.### Command line interface ###You can also use this tool at the command line, if you have either a .tsv or an hdf5 file, with the matrix under the key &quot;infile&quot;```python3 -m anticor_features.anticor_features -i exprs.tsv -species mmusculus```or something similar. This outputs the pandas table to a tsv in the same folder as the input fileSee the help section for more detailed usage of the command line interface:```python3 -m anticor_features.anticor_features -h```### License ###This package is available via the AGPLv3 license.### Who do I talk to? ###* Repo owner/admin: scottyler89+bitbucket@gmail.com</longdescription>

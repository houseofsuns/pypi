This includes the following:#### Command Line HelpFor the tool and all its subcommands, help can be retrieved by calling the tool with the `--help` flag:```consolecamouflage-decryptor --help```#### Metadata retrievalTo retrieve all the camouflage metadata from a prepared file the following command can be used:```consolecamouflage-decryptor get-info camouflaged-file.jpg```The output will look similar to this one:    File Name Carrier:             normal_file.png    File Name Secret:              secret.txt    Size secret file:              4.00 B    File size unmodified carrier:  4.00 B    Camouflage Version:            v1.2.1    Password:                      very-secret-password'Carrier' refers to the file that has been used to hide the secret file. 'Secret' refers to the file that has been hidden in the carrier file.#### Password retrievalTo get the password only from a stego file:```consolecamouflage-decryptor get-key my-stego-file.jpg```#### Secret file retrievalTo retrieve the secret file from a stego file and save it to a file (here: `secret.txt`):```consolecamouflage-decryptor get-data my-stego-file.jpg &gt; secret.txt```This solution only works on Linux and Mac OS X. On Windows, the following command can be used:```consolepython -m camouflage-decryptor get-data my-stego-file.jpg | Out-File -Encoding utf8 secret.txt```#### Get unmodified carrier fileTo get the unmodified carrier file from a stego file (-&gt; remove the part added by camouflage) and save it to a file (here: `carrier.png`):```consolecamouflage-decryptor get-original camouflaged-carrier.png &gt; carrier.png```This solution only works on Linux and Mac OS X. On Windows, the following command can be used:```consolepython -m camouflage-decryptor get-original camouflaged-carrier.png | Out-File -Encoding utf8 carrier.png```#### Advanced: Generate own static key file for larger filesThe tool is able to decrypt files up to 10MB using an embedded key. For larger files up to 1GB a static key is downloaded to decrypt the file.For larger files or to avoid the download of the static key, a custom static key can be supplied. A 1GB key can be downloaded from the releases for offline use: [https://github.com/anjomro/camouflage-decryptor/releases/download/v0.3.0/STATIC_KEY_1GB](https://github.com/anjomro/camouflage-decryptor/releases/download/v0.3.0/STATIC_KEY_1GB)A larger key can be obtained using the following steps:- Setup a virtual machine using Windows XP  - This can be done using this vagrant box: https://app.vagrantup.com/dvgamerr/boxes/win-xp-sp3  - Given that VirtualBox and Vagrant are installed the Box can be started using the following commands:    - ```console      mkdir vagrant-win-xp &amp;&amp; cd vagrant-win-xp      vagrant init dvgamerr/win-xp-sp3      vagrant up      ```  - Follow these instructions to setup a shared folder to exchange files: https://techblog.willshouse.com/2013/01/27/connect-to-a-shared-folder-with-virtualbox-and-windows-xp/- Download camouflage and install it on the virtual machine  - Download camouflage from here: http://camouflage.unfiction.com/  - Transfer the downloaded file to the virtual machine via the shared folder  - Install camouflage on the virtual machine- Create a payload with the intended size  - This can be done using the camouflage-decryptor tool:  - `camouflage-decryptor dev generate-test-payload 2GB &gt; PAYLOAD_2GB.txt`  - This will create a file with the size of 2GB. Adapt the size to your needs.- Transfer the payload to the virtual machine  - This can be done using the shared folder- Create a stego file using camouflage  - Find a carrier file (a file to hide the payload in)    - Ideally this file should be small to avoid unneccecary resource consumption    - Any random file will do    - If no file is at hand, just create a small text file  - Right click on the generated **payload** file and select the Camouflage Option  - Click _Next_  - For the field _Camouflage using_ select the previously selected carrier file  - For the field _Create This File_ select a sensible file name, e.g `camouflaged_2GB.txt` and remove the _read only_ checkmark  - You can leave the password field empty, but it also doesn't matter if you do set a password- Extract the static key from the file treated with Camouflage  - Use the camouoflage-decryptor tool to extract the static key  - `camouflage-decryptor dev extract-static-key path/to/camouflaged_2GB.txt &gt; save/path/STATIC_KEY_2GB`  - Adapt the paths to the location and the location you want to save the static key#### Advanced: Use a custom static key to decrypt a fileIf you want to use a custom static key to decrypt a file you can use it using the following syntax:```consoleCAMOUFLAGE_DECRYPTOR_KEY=/path/to/static/key.bin camouflage-decryptor get-data my-stego-file.jpg &gt; secret.txt```It is necessary to use an absolute path to the static key.To avoid prefixing every command, you can also set the static key for your session:```consoleexport CAMOUFLAGE_DECRYPTOR_KEY=/path/to/static/key.bin```After setting the key location once, you can then use the tool as usual:```consolecamouflage-decryptor get-data my-stego-file.jpg &gt; secret.txt```Both methods work with all functionality that requires a static key.To obtain a static key see the section above.#### Usage on WindowsFor all presented commands, you might need to use the following syntax to call the script, e.g. if on Windows:```consolepython -m camouflage_decryptor get-key my-stego-image.jpg```## License`camouflage-decryptor` is distributed under the terms of the [EUPL-1.2](https://spdx.org/licenses/EUPL-1.2.html) license.</longdescription>

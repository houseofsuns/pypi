	<longdescription>===========django-nose===========**django-nose** provides all the goodness of `nose`_ in your Django tests, like:* Testing just your apps by default, not all the standard ones that happen to  be in ``INSTALLED_APPS``* Running the tests in one or more specific modules (or apps, or classes, or  folders, or just running a specific test)* Obviating the need to import all your tests into ``tests/__init__.py``.  This not only saves busy-work but also eliminates the possibility of  accidentally shadowing test classes.* Taking advantage of all the useful `nose plugins`_.. _nose: https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.. _nose plugins: http://nose-plugins.jottit.com/It also provides:* Fixture bundling, an optional feature which speeds up your fixture-based  tests by a factor of 4* Reuse of previously created test DBs, cutting 10 seconds off startup time* Hygienic TransactionTestCases, which can save you a DB flush per test* Support for various databases. Tested with MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.  Others should work as well.django-nose requires nose 1.2.1 or later, and the `latest release`_ isrecommended.  It follows the `Django's support policy`_, supporting:* Django 1.8 (LTS) with Python 2.7, 3.4, or 3.5* Django 1.9 with Python 2.7, 3.4, or 3.5* Django 1.10 with Python 2.7, 3.4, or 3.5* Django 1.11 (LTS) with Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, or 3.6* Django 2.0 with Python 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, or 3.7* Django 2.1 with Python 3.5, 3.6, or 3.7* Django 2.2 with Python 3.5, 3.6, or 3.7.. _latest release: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose.. _Django's support policy: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/internals/release-process/#supported-versionsNote to users-------------`nose`_ has been in maintenance mode since at least 2015. ``django-nose`` is inmaintenance mode as well, and the sole maintainer is no longer an active user.See `Jazzband.co`_ to learn how ``django-nose`` is maintained and how you canhelp. New projects should consider using `pytest`_, or `unittest`_ with the`Django testing framework`_... _Jazzband.co: https://jazzband.co.. _pytest: https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/.. _unittest: https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html.. _Django testing framework: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/testing/Installation------------You can get django-nose from PyPI with... :.. code-block:: shell    $ pip install django-noseThe development version can be installed with... :.. code-block:: shell    $ pip install -e git://github.com/jazzband/django-nose.git#egg=django-noseSince django-nose extends Django's built-in test command, you should add it toyour ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in ``settings.py``:.. code-block:: python    INSTALLED_APPS = (        ...        'django_nose',        ...    )Then set ``TEST_RUNNER`` in ``settings.py``:.. code-block:: python    TEST_RUNNER = 'django_nose.NoseTestSuiteRunner'Development-----------:Code:   https://github.com/jazzband/django-nose:Issues: https://github.com/jazzband/django-nose/issues?state=open:Docs:   https://django-nose.readthedocs.ioChangelog---------1.4.7 (2020-08-19)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Document Django 2.2 support, no changes needed* Move project to `Jazzband.co &lt;https://jazzband.co&gt;`_* Fix fixture loading on MySQL  (`issue 307 &lt;https://github.com/jazzband/django-nose/issues/307&gt;`_,  `dlareau &lt;https://github.com/dlareau&gt;`_)1.4.6 (2018-10-03)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Document Django 2.0 and 2.1 support, no changes needed* Document Python 3.7 support1.4.5 (2017-08-22)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Add Django 1.11 support1.4.4 (2016-06-27)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Add Django 1.10 support* Drop Django 1.4 - 1.7, and Python 2.6 support* Drop South support1.4.3 (2015-12-28)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Add Django 1.9 support* Support long options without equals signs, such as &quot;--attr selected&quot;* Support nose plugins using callback options* Support nose options without default values (jsatt)* Remove Django from install dependencies, to avoid accidental upgrades  (jsocol, willkg)* Setting REUSE_DB to an empty value now disables REUSE_DB, instead of  enabling it (wdoekes)1.4.2 (2015-10-07)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Warn against using REUSE_DB=1 and FastFixtureTestCase in docs* REUSE_DB=1 uses new transaction management in Django 1.7, 1.8 (scottsexton)* Try to avoid accidentally using production database with REUSE_DB=1 (alexjg, eroninjapan)* Supported Django versions limited to current supported Django version 1.4,  1.7, and 1.8, as well as relevant Python versions.1.4.1 (2015-06-29)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Fix version number (ezarowny)* Fix choice options, unbreaking nose-cover (aamirtharaj-rpx, jwhitlock)* Support 1.8 app loading system (dgladkov)* Support non-ASCII file names (singingwolfboy)* Better PEP8'd assertion names (roganov)1.4 (2015-04-23)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Django 1.8 support (timc3, adepue, jwhitlock)* Support --testrunner option (st4lk)* Fix REUSE_DB second run in py3k (edrmp)1.3 (2014-12-05)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Django 1.6 and 1.7 support (conrado, co3k, Nepherhotep, mbertheau)* Python 3.3 and 3.4 testing and support (frewsxcv, jsocol)1.2 (2013-07-23)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Python 3 support (melinath and jonashaag)* Django 1.5 compat (fabiosantoscode)1.1 (2012-05-19)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Django TransactionTestCases don't clean up after themselves; they leave  junk in the DB and clean it up only on ``_pre_setup``. Thus, Django makes  sure these tests run last. Now django-nose does, too. This means one fewer  source of failures on existing projects. (Erik Rose)* Add support for hygienic TransactionTestCases. (Erik Rose)* Support models that are used only for tests. Just put them in any file  imported in the course of loading tests. No more crazy hacks necessary.  (Erik Rose)* Make the fixture bundler more conservative, fixing some conceivable  situations in which fixtures would not appear as intended if a  TransactionTestCase found its way into the middle of a bundle. (Erik Rose)* Fix an error that would surface when using SQLAlchemy with connection  pooling. (Roger Hu)* Gracefully ignore the new ``--liveserver`` option introduced in Django 1.4;  don't let it through to nose. (Adam DePue)1.0 (2012-03-12)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* New fixture-bundling plugin for avoiding needless fixture setup (Erik Rose)* Moved FastFixtureTestCase in from test-utils, so now all the  fixture-bundling stuff is in one library. (Erik Rose)* Added the REUSE_DB setting for faster startup and shutdown. (Erik Rose)* Fixed a crash when printing options with certain verbosities. (Daniel Abel)* Broke hard dependency on MySQL. Support PostgreSQL. (Roger Hu)* Support SQLite, both memory- and disk-based. (Roger Hu and Erik Rose)* Nail down versions of the package requirements.

	<longdescription># cuplcodec[cuplcodec](https://cupl.co.uk/index.php/software/cuplcodec/) encodes environmental sensor data into a URL. Each sample includes two 12-bit readings (temperature and humidity). These are converted to base64 and written into a circular buffer. A HMAC is written after the most recent sample in the buffer. The URL can be rendered as a QR code or stored on an NFC tag. If a tag with a URL is tapped by a mobile phone, it opens automatically in a web browser. This allows the user to view sensor data **without installing an app on their phones**. A web application comprising [cuplfrontend](https://github.com/cuplsensor/cuplfrontend) and [cuplbackend](https://github.com/cuplsensor/cuplbackend) runs the decoder in cuplcodec, unwraps the circular buffer and displays a list of samples in the browser.## Tests![GitHub Workflow Status](https://github.com/cuplsensor/cuplcodec/workflows/Python%20package/badge.svg)The codec is tested with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/). The encoder written in C can be tested with the decoder written in Python using [CFFI](https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).## Documentation [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/wscodec/badge/?version=latest)](https://readthedocs.org/projects/wscodec/badge/?version=latest) Hosted on [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/wscodec/badge/?version=latest). This includes information on how to run the encoder on an MSP430.## PyPI Package[![PyPI pyversions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/ansicolortags.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cuplcodec/)Hosted on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/cuplcodec/).

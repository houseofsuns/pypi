	<longdescription># SkidwardScheduler For Python Scripts## PrerequisitesThe project was built with Python 3.6.7 and requires a working Postgres and Redis setup.  Please refer to your operating system's specific installation instructions per package.* Python 3.6.7* Postgres (tested on 11 and up)* Redis (tested on 5 and up)## Installation- Install the requirements        $ pip install -r requirements.txt- Create user (called a 'role') in postgres and give it ownership over the new db**Note:** It is recommended to create a user with a password, even for development purposes.        $ createuser skidwarduser        $ createdb skidwarddb -O skidwarduserThe application uses environment variables to offer flexible configuration options.  Before using the application, review the configuration in the `.env` file to match your desired setup.  A typical connectionstring looks like this:    `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI='postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@localhost/DATABASENAME'` - Copy the `.env.default` file to the skidward module and rename to `.env`.          $ cp .env.default skidward/.env- Migrate the database        $ python -m skidward migrate- Publish available workers on the namespace in the database        $ python -m skidward publish-workers- Create an admin user for use in the application        $ python -m skidward create-admin USER_EMAIL#### Development- Install the development requirements        $ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt- Set up the git pre-commit hook required for development        $ pre-commit install*Optional:* If you want to install demo-workers from a proxy,navigate to the root of your virtual environment and create a `pip.conf` file.        $ touch pip.conf        $ echo &quot;[global]&quot; &gt;&gt; pip.conf        $ echo &quot;extra-index-url = URL_TO_PROXY&quot; &gt;&gt; pip.conf#### Contributing to the documentationAll documentation is built with Sphix and can be found in the `docs` folder,with pages in `docs/src` and images located in `docs/src/images`.-  Build the docs        $ cd docs        $ make html- Open the result in a web browser (here Firefox is used)        $ firefox _build/html/index.html## Running the applicationThere's an admin interface provided to communicate with the application,  and then there's the backend side doing the operations.### 1. Web interface- Point Flask to the location of the web application        $ export FLASK_APP=skidward.web- Run the default setup (in the same session as the previous command)        $ flask run### 2. Scheduler side- Start a new scheduler process (in the fore- or background)        $ python -m skidward start-scheduler        # Runs in your session        $ python -m skidward start-scheduler true   # Creates a new process running in the background</longdescription>

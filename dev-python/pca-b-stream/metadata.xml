First this has not been fully tested by, for example, re-creating an array on a another machine with a native endianness different from the one it was originally instantiated on. Second, more work might be required to ensure that enumeration ordering is correctly dealt with.Documentation=============Functions---------The ``pca_b_stream`` module defines the following functions:- ``PCA2BStream``    - Generates the byte stream representation of an array; Does not check the array validity (see ``PCArrayIssues``)    - Input: a `Numpy ndarray &lt;https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html&gt;`_    - Output: an object of type `bytes &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-objects&gt;`_- ``BStream2PCA``    - Re-creates the array from its bytes stream representation; Does not check the stream format validity    - Input/Output: input and output of ``PCA2BStream`` swapped- ``PCArrayIssues``    - Checks whether an array is a valid input for stream representation generation; It is meant to be used before calling ``PCA2BStream``    - Input: a `Numpy ndarray &lt;https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html&gt;`_    - Output: a tuple issues in ``str`` format. The tuple is empty if the array is valid.    - Additional information about what are valid piecewise-constant arrays here is provided in the section `&quot;Motivations&quot; &lt;sct_motivations_&gt;`_.- ``BStreamDetails``    - Extract details from a byte stream representation; See section `&quot;Byte Stream Format&quot; &lt;byte_stream_format_&gt;`_    - Inputs:        - a byte stream generated by ``PCA2BStream``        - details: a string where each character corresponds to a detail to extract, or &quot;+&quot; to extract all of the available details; Default: &quot;+&quot;; Available details are:            - c: compression indicator            - d: array dimension            - l: array lengths per dimension            - t: dtype type code; See: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.dtype.char.html            - T: dtype name; Translated from &quot;t&quot; by Numpy.sctypeDict            - o: enumeration order; See: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.flags.html, ?_CONTIGUOUS            - e: endianness (or byte order); See: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.dtype.byteorder.html        - should_print: a boolean to instruct whether the extracted details should be printed to console; Defaults: False        - should_return: a boolean to instruct whether the extracted details should be returned (see Outputs); Defaults: True    - Output: either one of:        - None if should_return is False        - a dictionary of all of the available details if the ``details`` parameter is &quot;+&quot;        - a tuple of the requested details in the same order as in the ``details`` parameterCommand Line Scripts--------------------The ``PCA-B-Stream`` project defines two command line scripts: ``pca2bstream`` and ``bstream2pca``. The former takes a path to an image file as argument, and prints the corresponding byte stream (without the &quot;b&quot; string type prefix). The latter takes a character string and a filename as arguments, in that order, and creates an image file with this name that corresponds to the string interpreted as a byte stream. The file must not already exist... _byte_stream_format:Byte Stream Format------------------A byte stream is a `base85-encoded &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/base64.html#base64.b85encode&gt;`_ stream. Once decoded, it has the following format (in lexicographical order; all characters are in ``bytes`` format):- one character &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1&quot;: indicates whether the remaining of the stream is in uncompressed or `ZLIB compressed &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/zlib.html#zlib.compress&gt;`_ format; See `note on compression &lt;note_on_compression_&gt;`_; The remaining of the description applies to the stream in uncompressed format- 3 characters &quot;{E}{T}{O}&quot;:    - E: endianness among &quot;|&quot;, &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot;    - T: ``dtype`` character code among: &quot;?&quot; + numpy.typecodes[&quot;AllInteger&quot;] + numpy.typecodes[&quot;Float&quot;]    - O: enumeration order among &quot;C&quot; (C-ordering) and &quot;F&quot; (Fortran-ordering)- one integer for the dimension of the array (1 for vectors, 2 for matrices, 3 for volumes...)- one integer per dimension giving the length of the array in that dimensionThe remaining of the stream is the actual array content.- If the array is not all False's or zeros:    - one character &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1&quot;: whether the first value in the array is zero (or False) or one (or True)    - one integer for the length of the run-length representation    - integers of the `run-length representation &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding&gt;`_ of the array read in its proper enumeration order- If the array is all False's or zeros:    - one character &quot;2&quot;All the integers are encoded by the `unsigned LEB128 encoding &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEB128#Unsigned_LEB128&gt;`_ using the `leb128 project &lt;https://github.com/mohanson/leb128&gt;`_.For non-boolean arrays with a maximum value of 2 or more, the content part is the concatenation of the sub-contents corresponding to each value between 1 and the maximum value in the array... _note_on_compression:.. note::    For small arrays, compressing the byte stream actually produces a longer stream.Acknowledgments===============The project is developed with `PyCharm Community &lt;https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/&gt;`_.The development relies on several open-source packages(see ``install_requires`` in ``setup.py``, if present; otherwise ``import`` statements should be searched for).The code is formatted by `Black &lt;https://github.com/psf/black/&gt;`_, *The Uncompromising Code Formatter*.The imports are ordered by `isort &lt;https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort/&gt;`_... *your imports, so you don't have to*.</longdescription>

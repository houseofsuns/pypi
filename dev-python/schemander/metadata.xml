	<longdescription># Schemander&gt; As in Schema + Commander... &gt;&gt; ... it took me a while to connect the name with the &quot;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them&quot; (2016) film, main character.This module aims to simplify the way we handle JSON Schemas in Python, leveraging type annotations.## Install```pip install schemander```When working with JSON is common to have situations in which string values are &quot;blest&quot; with extra meaning or behaviour such as dates, datetimes, email, phone numbers, amoung others. This module solves this by defining a class that we can extend called `InternalObjectTypeString`, which attempt to convert the value of the string in to an object while preserving the string version as a main display value, exposing the converted object via an attribute named `value`.Moreover when converting a JSON in to a data structure, we usually have to pass through a dictionary, and then &quot;cast&quot; in to the desired representation we desire. For this we define a `Schema` from which we need to extend in order to define a schema where you will define attributes with a type-hint, `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, `typing.List` with a given type to have a homogeneous array (heterogeneous, are not supported) or a _class_ that will take the field value as only argument for construction, such as `UUID`, or some of the `InternalObjectTypeString` or `RegexValidatedString`.An example on how to write for a _user_ could be found at `./example.py`.</longdescription>

[Adaptive Runge-Kutta Example](#ark-eg)&lt;h1 id=&quot;rko&quot;&gt;Runge-Kutta Overview&lt;/h1&gt;Runge-Kutta methods aim to numerically solve ordinary differential equations of the form:$$\frac{\text{d}y}{\text{d}x}=f(x,y)$$with a given initial condition $(x_0, y_0)$. We define a member of the Runge-Kutta family with a *Butcher tableau*:&lt;!-- $$  \begin{array}{c| c c c c}    0\\    c_2 &amp; a_{21}\\    c_3 &amp; a_{31} &amp; a_{32}\\    \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp;  &amp; \ddots\\    c_r &amp; a_{r1} &amp; a_{r2} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{rr-1}\\    \hline      &amp; b_1 &amp; b_2 &amp; \cdots &amp; b_{r-1} &amp; b_r  \end{array}\\ \\$$ --&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;247&quot; alt=&quot;genrk&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/yfnaji/Gerk/assets/59436765/c35b7df0-0080-41bf-8f1d-04a53ad9dac5&quot;&gt;The above tableau is often abbreviated to&lt;!-- $$  \begin{array}{c| c}    c &amp; A\\    \hline      &amp; b  \end{array}\\ \\$$ --&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;103&quot; alt=&quot;abbrk&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/yfnaji/Gerk/assets/59436765/561bd4fb-d488-44cf-9246-56cb392ad66d&quot;&gt;The Butcher tableau presents the categories of coefficients that will be used in our Runge-Kutta method.The $n^\text{th}$ evaluation of the solution will be denoted as $(x_n, y_n)$. We also define $h$ as the time step i.e. the step size from the previous approximation to the next, and therefore$$x_{n+1} = x_{n} + h$$Before defining $y_n$, we must familiarize ourselves with the array $k$. We define the $i^{\text{th}}$ row of $k$ at $(x_n, y_n)$ as:$$k_i(x_n, y_n) = f\left(x_n + c_i h, y_n + \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} a_{ij}k_j(x_n, y_n)\right)$$where $f$ is the function defined in the differential equation above. Note the recursion in the second argument of $f$ where we sum rows preceding $k_{i}$ and apply a scale factor of $a_{ij}$.We now have everything we need to calculate $y_{n+1}$:$$y_{n+1} = y_{n} + h \sum_{i=1}^{r}b_i k_{i}(x_n, y_n)$$The idea is to calculate various slopes at point $y_n$ to ascertain a weighted of the ascent (or descent) and add it to the previous approximation.&lt;h1 id=&quot;wig&quot;&gt;What is Gerk?&lt;/h1&gt;Most packages for the Runge-Kutta method usually have the coefficients $a_{ij}$, $b_i$ and $c_i$ determined beforehand for known methods such as the *Forward-Euler method*, the *1/4 rule*, *the 3/8 rule* etc, but do not allow one to customerize their own Runge-Kutta.Gerk is an easy interface to allow the user to determine their own coefficient values for the Runge-Kutta method. The package can return the approximations in the form of an array, a plot of the approximated curve (using matplotlib) and also compare with real values (if available) to produce errors and even an efficiency graph!&lt;h1 id=&quot;h2ug&quot;&gt;How to use Gerk&lt;/h1&gt;We can simply import `Gerk` in the following way:```from gerk import Gerk```&lt;h2 id=&quot;attr&quot;&gt;Attributes&lt;/h2&gt;As seen in mathematics above, there is quite a bit information required to execute the Runge-Kutta method. This has been broken down into arguments to be passed into the `Gerk` class:- `A` The $A$ matrix in the Butcher tableau. This **must** be a lower triangular matrix that is formatted as a list of lists that contain floats, decimals or integers **Note**: Fractions must be in a string e.g. &quot;1/3&quot;- `b` The $b$ array. Must be a list of floats, decimals or integers- `c` The $c$ array. Must be a list of floats, decimals or integers- `initial_conditions` A `tuple` that acts as the coordinate of the initial condition values $(x_0, y_0)$- `final` The value of $x$ for which we terminate the Runge-Kutta method- `time_steps` The number of times steps you want to apply on the from the starting point $x_0$ to `final`. Must be an integer- `func` The function expression to be numerically integrated- `real_values` (Optional) A `callable` which is the explicit solution to the initial value problem _**or**_ a list of real values **Note** the list must be of size `time_steps + 1`&lt;h2 id=&quot;cond-arg&quot;&gt;Condition Arguments&lt;/h2&gt;There is no consensus to what conditions must hold regarding the coefficients you choose for your method, however, some known Runge-Kutta methods do consistently conform to some known conditions.These conditions are$$\sum_{i=1}^{r}b_i=1 \ \ \ \ \sum_{i=1}^{r}b_ic_i = 1/2 \ \ \ \ \sum_{j=1}^{r}a_{ij} = c_i$$which can be enforced by the boolean parameters `condition_b`, `condition_bc` and `condition_Ac` respectively. These parameters have been set to `False` by default to allow the user to freely explore and experiment.&lt;h2 id=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;* `solve` can be run to calculate the approximate value of $y_n$ for each time step*  `efficiency_graph` plots the efficiency graph of the Runge-Kutta method for the defined system for time steps 100, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000 and 1,000,000Once `solve` has been run, the following methods will be available to execute:* `plot` Creates a graph of the approximated curve. If you have set the (optional) `real_values` argument, you can plot both the approximated and exact curves in one plot by setting `with_real=True`. You also have the option to amend `x_label` and `y_label` which are arugments of the method* `get_approximation` returns the approximated values of $y$ in a list* `get_errors` returns the error for each approximation $y_n$ in a list (only applicable if `real_values` argument was used)&lt;h1 id=&quot;example&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;cgo&quot;&gt;Creating the Gerk Object&lt;/h2&gt;In the example below, we will use the 3/8-th rule to approximate the following initial value problem:$$\frac{\text{d}y}{\text{d}x} = y$$with the initial condition $(0, 1)$ and will be making approximations up to $x=5$ with 1000 time steps.The 3/8-th rule has the following Butcher tableau:&lt;!-- $$  \begin{array}{c| c c c}    0\\    1/3 &amp; 1/3\\    2/3 &amp; -1/3 &amp; 1\\    1 &amp; 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 1\\    \hline      &amp; 1/8 &amp; 3/8 &amp; 3/8 &amp; 1/8  \end{array}\\ \\$$ --&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;236&quot; alt=&quot;rk_eg&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/yfnaji/Gerk/assets/59436765/0105ab38-e0b3-4b97-b5d7-d3fcc1eddb2b&quot;&gt;The $A$ lower triangular matrix in the Butcher tableau above can be implemented in the following way:```A = [         [&quot;1/3&quot;], # Remember, fractions must be passed as strings        [&quot;-1/3&quot;, 1],        [1, -1, 1]]```Note that if you would rather use &quot;square&quot; matrices, you can also define `A` as:```A = [        [0,0,0,0],         [&quot;1/3&quot;, 0, 0, 0],        [&quot;-1/3&quot;, 1, 0, 0],        [1, -1, 1, 0]]```Either version of `A` is acceptable in `Gerk`.Now for the `b` and `c` vectors:```b = [&quot;1/8&quot;, &quot;3/8&quot;, &quot;3/8&quot;, &quot;1/8&quot;]c = [0, &quot;1/3&quot;, &quot;2/3&quot;, 1]```We now have sufficient information to create `Gerk` object. However, we know the solution to the initial value problem is $y=e^x$. So in this case, we can utilise the `real_values` parameter by setting it to the lambda function:```lambda x,y: math.exp(x)```Now we are ready to create the `Gerk` object:```import mathrk_obj = Gerk(        A=A,         b=b,         c=c,         initial_conditions=(0, 1),         time_steps=1000,         final=5,        func=lambda x, y: y, # Remember, you must define both x and y as variables, even if one is not used        real_values = lambda y: math.exp(y)    )```We can now run `rk_obj.solve()`.After running `solve`, 3 methods are now available to us:&lt;h2 id=&quot;plot-eg&quot;&gt;plot example&lt;/h2&gt;We can now plot our approximated curve. Note that because we have defined `real_values`, we also have the option to plot the exact solution by setting the `with_real` flag to `True`.```rk_obj.plot(with_real=True)```&lt;img width=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;rk_example&quot; src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59436765/210466156-f86bfb1e-f088-4791-a16a-01220298e6bd.png&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-approx-eg&quot;&gt;get_approximations example&lt;/h2&gt;The approximated values $y_n$ for each timestep can be obtained by running `get_approximations` which returns a list of the values:```rk_obj.get_approximations[2:5]```&gt; [Decimal('1.010062750717580079753282335'), Decimal('1.015132034738508612169525261'), Decimal('1.020226760387164317916560525')]_Note_ that this is a _property_ and not a method, so no need for parentheses.&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-err-eg&quot;&gt;get_errors example&lt;/h2&gt;The errors for each time step can also be obtained if the `real_value` parameter has been set. In this example, we set `real_values=lambda x: math.exp(x)` which will be used to calculate the error at each step. By simply calling `get_errors`, we obtain all the errors in the form of a list (again, no need for parentheses):```rk_obj.get_errors[2:5]```&gt; [Decimal('0.00001258363341213062577786389261'), Decimal('0.00001897012278968249653135224731'), Decimal('0.00002542036040854158088425155254')]&lt;h2 id=&quot;eff-graph-eg&quot;&gt;Efficiency Graph&lt;/h2&gt;We can create an efficiency graph for the Runge-Kutta method provided that `real_values` has been set to a callable function. This can be done by simply running:```rk_obj.efficiency_graph()```&lt;img width=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;efficiency_graph&quot; src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59436765/210466181-fbc3a2ea-0fac-44b9-a067-bf01bf72ee8f.png&gt;_Note:_ You do not need to run `solve()` beforehand to produce efficiency graph.&lt;h1 id=&quot;ark&quot;&gt;Adaptive Runge-Kutta Methods&lt;/h1&gt;There is an alternate way to utilise the Runge-Kutta method by employing an additional distinct $b$ array. The Butcher tableau for such methods take the form:&lt;img width=&quot;242&quot; alt=&quot;adaptive_butcher&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59436765/210662922-f5fbf612-a56b-4679-af2c-5eca4956771d.png&quot;&gt;where $b^*_i$ is the additional $b$ array.This method is not too disimilar to the original Runge-Kutta method. We calculate the $k$'s in the same way as before, but there is an extra step when evaluating $y_{n+1}$. Although we do calculate $y_{n+1}$ in same way outlined above, we also calculate $\hat{y}_{n+1}$:$$y_{n+1} = y_{n} + h \sum_{i=1}^{r}b_i\cdot k_{i}(x_n, y_n) \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \hat{y_{n+1}} = y_{n} + h \sum_{i=1}^{r} b_{i}^{\ast}\cdot k_{i}(x_n, y_n)$$_Note_ that the calculation for $\hat{y}$ requires the use of $y_n$ and **not** $\hat{y}_n$.For every time step, we calculate the following error:$$E := \left|y_{n+1}-\hat{y}_{n+1}\right|$$Now we define the tolerance, $\mathcal{E}$, which will act as the maximum acceptable value for $E$.If $E&lt;\mathcal{E}$, then we accept the value of $y_{n+1}$ and we increment $x_{n}$ by $h$ and start the process again for $x_{n+1}$ and $y_{n+1}$ as normal. However, if $E\geq\mathcal{E}$, we will need to adjust the value of $h$ and redo the calculation with this renewed time step value in an attempt to satisfy the condition $E&lt;\mathcal{E}$. The value of $h$ will be adjusted as follows:$$h \rightarrow 0.9\cdot h \cdot\sqrt[n]{\frac{h}{\mathcal{E}}}$$where $n=\min\left(p,q\right)$, where $p$ and $q$ are the orders $^1$ of $b_i$ and $b^*_i$ respectively.$^1$ A Runge-Kutta method with matrix $A$ and arrays $b$ and $c$ has order $p$ if$$\sum_{i=1}^{p}b_i = 1 \ \ \ \ \sum_{i=1}^{p}b_ic_i = 1/2 \ \ \ \ \sum_{j=1}^{p}a_{ij} = c_i  \ \ \ \ $$These are similar to the conditions defined above with the parameters `condition_b`, `condition_bc` and `condition_Ac` respectively. However, it is difficult to calculate the order when these conditions are not met. Therefore, to simplify things, $h$ will be re-calculated in the same way whether these conditions are met or not. In the future, we aim to come up with a solution to reflect a more appropriate solution.Note that you can impose the same conditions on $b^*_i$ with the parameters `condition_b_star` and `condition_b_star_c` for the first two conditions. Again, these are set to `False` by default.&lt;h1 id=&quot;ark-eg&quot;&gt;Adaptive Runge-Kutta example&lt;/h1&gt;In this example, we will try to numerically integrate$$\frac{\text{d}y}{\text{d}x}=-2xy$$with initial conditions $(-5, 1.3887943865\times 10^{-11})$. Note that the exact solution is $y=e^{-x^2}$.Here we will use the Fehlberg RK1(2) method which has the following Butcher tableau:&lt;!-- $$  \begin{array}{c| c c c}    0 \\    1/2 &amp; 1/2\\    1 &amp; 1/256 &amp; 255/256\\    \hline      &amp; 1/512 &amp; 255/256 &amp; 1/512\\      &amp; 1/512 &amp; 255/256 &amp; 0\\  \end{array}\\ \\$$ --&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;252&quot; alt=&quot;adaptrk&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/yfnaji/Gerk/assets/59436765/bd1e8482-0153-49b2-809e-5a9424ecccd2&quot;&gt;We require an additional argument for the $b^*$ vector, which in `Gerk` is called `b_star`:```A = [        [&quot;1/2&quot;], # Remember, fractions need to be in strings        [&quot;1/256&quot;, &quot;255/256&quot;]    ]b = [    &quot;1/512&quot;, &quot;255/256&quot;, &quot;1/512&quot;]b_star = [    &quot;1/256&quot;, &quot;255/256&quot;, 0]c = [    0, &quot;1/2&quot;, 1]```The idea of discretizations is meaningless in this context since the step size is constantly changing. Therefore, the `time_steps` parameter will be used as the *starting* time step, which we will set to 0.01 in this example.We will set the tolerance to a punitive value of 0.00000001. _Note: if `tolerance` is not set, a default value of 0.001 will be used instead.We can now create our `Gerk` object, `solve` and `plot`:```adj_rk = Gerk(    A=A,     b=b,     c=c,     initial_conditions=(-5.0, 1.3887943865e-11),    time_steps=0.001, # Remeber, this needs to be the step size NOT the number of discretizations    final=5,    func=lambda x,y: -2*x*y,    real_values=lambda x: math.exp(-x**2),    b_star=b_star,    tolerance=0.00001)adj_rk.solve()adj_rk.plot(with_real=True)```&lt;img width=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;rk_adaptive&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59436765/210466230-cbee11e0-02e5-49ab-92f1-553e302a972f.png&quot;&gt;In this case, the Runge-Kutta approximation is so accurate that we can barely see the exact curve!Efficiency graphs are not available for the adaptive Runge-Kutta method as the number discretizations is not constant.&lt;h1&gt;Additional Notes&lt;/h1&gt;* I have taken some inspiration from [this paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2297-8747/21/4/46) by M. A. Demba, N.Senu and F. Ismail which helped in understanding the adaptive RK method and from [Jim Verner's](https://www.sfu.ca/~jverner/) extensive research in exploring Runge-Kutta possibilities* Future works will include   1. Accept `numpy.array` as parameter input   2. Extend and generalize the adaptive Runge-Kutta Method, an idea inspired by [M. A. Demba, N.Senu and F. Ismail](https://www.mdpi.com/2297-8747/21/4/46)* Find solution to finding RK orders when conditions are not met</longdescription>

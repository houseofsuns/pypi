	<longdescription># Nexus Bundler for HopprThe Nexus Bundler is a plug-in for [Hoppr](https://gitlab.com/lmco/hoppr/hoppr) to package the collected artifacts into an existing Nexus instance.## ConfigurationThe following fields are supported values for configuring this plugin (in the Hoppr transfer configuration file):| Option | Description | Default || ------ | ------ |------||url| The URL for the Nexus API | Port 8081 on the server specified by the NEXUS_IP environment variable, using an `http://` schema ||username| User name to be used to access the Nexus instance | `admin` ||password_env| Envirionment variable containing the password to access the Nexus instance with the above username | `NEXUS_PW`||docker_url| URL to be used to access the docker repository on the Nexus instance. | Port 5000 on the server specified by the NEXUS_IP environment variable, using an `http://` schema ||docker_port| Port on which the Nexus instance should listen for docker requests | `5000` ||force_http| Indicates whether docker requests should be accessed using the `http://` or `https://` url schema.  |`False` (docker requests must be made using `https://`) |**Note**: At this time, the Nexus Bundler only supports a single Docker repository per Nexus instance**Note**: The port of the `docker_url` may differ from that specified by `docker_port` because of port forwarding (for example, if Nexus is run as a docker image).  `docker_port` is the port used internally by Nexus.For example, if Nexus is run as a docker image via `docker run -p 1701:5000 sonatype/nexus3:3.40.1` then the  `docker_port` would be `5000`, and the `docker_url` would be something like `https://myserver.com:1701/`.</longdescription>

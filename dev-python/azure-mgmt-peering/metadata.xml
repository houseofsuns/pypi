	<longdescription># Microsoft Azure SDK for PythonThis is the Microsoft Azure Peering Management Client Library.This package has been tested with Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8.For a more complete view of Azure libraries, see the [azure sdk python release](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/all).# UsageTo learn how to use this package, see the [quickstart guide](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt)For docs and references, see [Python SDK References](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/)Code samples for this package can be found at [Peering Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/browse/?languages=python&amp;term=Getting%20started%20-%20Managing&amp;terms=Getting%20started%20-%20Managing) on docs.microsoft.com.Additional code samples for different Azure services are available at [Samples Repo](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt/samples)# Provide FeedbackIf you encounter any bugs or have suggestions, please file an issue in the[Issues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues)section of the project.![Impressions](https://azure-sdk-impressions.azurewebsites.net/api/impressions/azure-sdk-for-python%2Fazure-mgmt-peering%2FREADME.png)# Release History## 1.0.0 (2021-04-25)**Features**  - Model PeerAsn has a new parameter peer_contact_info  - Added operation group PeeringServicePrefixesOperations**Breaking changes**  - Operation PrefixesOperations.list_by_peering_service has a new signature  - Operation PeeringServiceLocationsOperations.list has a new signature  - Operation LegacyPeeringsOperations.list has a new signature  - Model DirectConnection no longer has parameter error_message  - Model DirectConnection no longer has parameter microsoft_tracking_id  - Model PeeringServicePrefix no longer has parameter events  - Model PeeringServicePrefix no longer has parameter error_message  - Model PeeringServicePrefix no longer has parameter peering_service_prefix_key  - Model ExchangeConnection no longer has parameter error_message  - Model PeerAsn no longer has parameter error_message  - Model PeerAsn no longer has parameter peer_contact_detail  - Model PeeringService no longer has parameter sku  - Model ErrorResponse has a new signature  - Removed operation PrefixesOperations.delete  - Removed operation PrefixesOperations.create_or_update  - Removed operation PrefixesOperations.get  - Removed operation group CdnPeeringPrefixesOperations  - Removed operation group ReceivedRoutesOperations  - Removed operation group RegisteredAsnsOperations  - Removed operation group PeeringServiceCountriesOperations  - Removed operation group RegisteredPrefixesOperations## 1.0.0b1 (2020-12-07)This is beta preview version.This version uses a next-generation code generator that introduces important breaking changes, but also important new features (like unified authentication and async programming).**General breaking changes**- Credential system has been completly revamped:  - `azure.common.credentials` or `msrestazure.azure_active_directory` instances are no longer supported, use the `azure-identity` classes instead: https://pypi.org/project/azure-identity/  - `credentials` parameter has been renamed `credential`- The `config` attribute no longer exists on a client, configuration should be passed as kwarg. Example: `MyClient(credential, subscription_id, enable_logging=True)`. For a complete set of  supported options, see the [parameters accept in init documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#available-policies)- You can't import a `version` module anymore, use `__version__` instead- Operations that used to return a `msrest.polling.LROPoller` now returns a `azure.core.polling.LROPoller` and are prefixed with `begin_`.- Exceptions tree have been simplified and most exceptions are now `azure.core.exceptions.HttpResponseError` (`CloudError` has been removed).- Most of the operation kwarg have changed. Some of the most noticeable:  - `raw` has been removed. Equivalent feature can be found using `cls`, a callback that will give access to internal HTTP response for advanced user  - For a complete set of  supported options, see the [parameters accept in Request documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#available-policies)**General new features**- Type annotations support using `typing`. SDKs are mypy ready.- This client has now stable and official support for async. Check the `aio` namespace of your package to find the async client.- This client now support natively tracing library like OpenCensus or OpenTelemetry. See this [tracing quickstart](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/core/azure-core-tracing-opentelemetry) for an overview.## 0.2.0 (2020-04-12)**Features**  - Model PeeringServicePrefix has a new parameter peering_service_prefix_key  - Model PeerAsn has a new parameter peer_contact_detail  - Model PeeringService has a new parameter sku  - Added operation group RegisteredPrefixesOperations  - Added operation group PeeringServiceCountriesOperations  - Added operation group RegisteredAsnsOperations**Breaking changes**  - Operation LegacyPeeringsOperations.list has a new signature  - Operation PrefixesOperations.create_or_update has a new signature  - Operation PeeringServiceLocationsOperations.list has a new signature  - Model PeerAsn no longer has parameter peer_contact_info## 0.1.0rc2 (2019-10-24)**Breaking changes**  - Migrated operations from PeeringServicePrefixesOperations to    PrefixesOperations## 0.1.0rc1 (2019-09-26)  - Initial Release</longdescription>

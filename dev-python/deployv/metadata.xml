	<longdescription>CI Status===[![Pypi version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/deployv.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/deployv)[![Build status](https://git.vauxoo.com/vauxoo/deployv/badges/master/build.svg)](https://git.vauxoo.com/vauxoo/deployv/commits/master)[![coverage status](https://git.vauxoo.com/vauxoo/deployv/badges/master/coverage.svg)](https://coverage.vauxoo.com/master-master/)[![Documentation](https://git.vauxoo.com/vauxoo/deployv/badges/master/build.svg)](https://git.vauxoo.com/deployv/orchest/wikis/home)DeployV===The main DeployV goal is to have a set of tools for working with dockerized Odoo instances as a library or command lineinterface using a simple json formatted config files.It is planned that in further versions will be an [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com) integration so the whole configurationprocess can be done directly in the instance and deployed to the corresponding server (this would be configurable too)using [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) for messaging. This graphical interface development is done in the [Orchest](https://github.com/Vauxoo/orchest) repository.Getting started===## InstallingBefore installing the library you will need to have the following installed:* build-essential* python-setuptools* python-dev* libpq-dev* libffi-devThis can be performed executing the following:    $ sudo apt-get update     $ sudo apt-get install build-essential python-setuptools python-dev libpq-dev libffi-devAll Python dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt and will be installed when you run:        $ python setup.py install    Notice that you must have docker and PostgreSQL installed on your system, if not you can install docker following the[official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux) and you can use the a PostgreSQL container ([vauxoo/docker-postgresql](https://hub.docker.com/r/vauxoo/docker-postgresql/)), run it:    $ docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:5136:5432 -p 172.17.42.1:5136:5432 --name odoo_psql vauxoo/docker-postgresql:latest /entry_point start    The port 5136 is used to avoid conflict with any postgres running instance. It is attached to the docker interface andthe [loopback](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/nag/node66.html) so it is accessible from the container and the host only,the **--name** parameter is optional and can be changed to your needs. To see a detailed description of the parametersgo to [docker cli documentation page](https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/).**Note:** This have been tested with docker 1.7.1 only## Testing the installationIn the test folder you can find a sample configuration file names *config.json* this file uses a [docker test image](https://hub.docker.com/r/vauxoo/odoo80-test/) that have some public repositories and Odoo 8.0.Run the create command:    $ deployvcmd create -f /path/to/tests/config.json -l DEBUG -z /any/path    Notice that the backup must start with customer_id if you specify a directory, if you specify a specific file only thenthe name format does not matter.## Basic commandsThe image for the instance can be created by:    $ deployvcmd build -u git@github.com:user/app_repo.git -v 8.0And it will create a docker image using Odoo 8.0 and will install all dependencies from the requirements.txt and oca_dependencies.txt, if you wish to build froma development branch just do:    $ deployvcmd build -u git@github.com:user-dev/app_repo.git -b my_dev_branch -v 8.0     As you can see in the test section you can easily create an Odoo instance using the command line, but also generatea backup from it:    $ deployvcmd backupdb -f /path/to/tests/config.json -z ./backup/path -d database_name_to_backup    Or you can create a backup from an instance in a container:    $ deployvcmd backupdb -n container_name -z ./backup/path -d database_name_to_backupI will generate a compressed file in *./backup/path* with a database dump, attachments and a json file with theinstance branches info.To restore the generated dump just have to execute:    $ deployvcmd restore -f /path/to/tests/config.json -z ./backup/pathAlso, if you want to restore it to a dockerized instance:    $ deployvcmd restore -n container_name -z ./backup/pathThis will search the best best backup to restore or if you wish to specify one:    $  deployvcmd restore -f /path/to/tests/config.json -z ./backup/path/backup_file.tar.bz2The database name is generated automatically, but you can change this behaviour too:    $ deployvcmd restore -f /path/to/tests/config.json -z ./backup/path/backup_file.tar.bz2 -d specific_database_name### Anonymize dataThis functionality is based on [Postgresql Anonymizer Extension](https://postgresql-anonymizer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).The extension must be installed in host/container where database is located, by executing (as root user):    #  apt install pgxnclient build-essential postgresql-server-dev-kk    #  pgxn install postgresql_anonymizerwhere `kk` its postgresql version (according to host/container), like: 9.6, 10, 11, etc,Also, `odoo` user (in database) must have superuser privilege (in order to create and activate extension, create schema and functions):    ALTER USER odoo WITH SUPERUSER;In deactivate step, anonymization of data could be executed. For that, create a file `/etc/deployv/deactivate/anon_operations.csv` as indicated by internal documentation.</longdescription>

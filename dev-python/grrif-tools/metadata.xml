	<longdescription># GRRIF ToolsA set of tools for Cool Cats™. Allows you to archive GRRIF's play history to a SQLite database (or text files), compute/display some stats (top 10/25/100 artists and tracks), stream the radio live in your console, and scrobble it to last.fm.```usage: grrif_tools [-h] {archive,stats,scrobble} ...A set of tools for Cool Cats™. Allows you to archive GRRIF's play history and scrobble it to last.fm (upcoming).positional arguments:  {archive,stats,scrobble}    archive             Archive GRRIF's play history.    stats               Get some stats out of the database.    play                Streams GRRIF to the console and displays the currently playing track.    scrobble            Scrobble to Last.fm.options:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  ```    **NOTE:** This package is unofficial and meant mostly as a playground to experiment with some new things (argparse, python packaging, etc...). Please do not DDoS GRRIF's website !    **NOTE2:** Last.fm scrobbling is working and active while either streaming (&quot;play&quot;) or using &quot;scrobble start&quot;. This library will not handle authentification and requires some manual setup for last.fm's API access. Please create your own app on last.fm (https://www.last.fm/api/account/create) to get your API_KEY and API_SECRET, and see https://www.last.fm/api/authspec on how to get your SESSION_KEY (hint: it involves getting a token first and some md5 hashing).</longdescription>

It so happens, that I have to work with a Sybase ASE database and I wanted to have a tool to interact with it.  ## But why ?The reason I built this is fairly simple although frustrating:* My company has tight control over what gets installed on the workstations* My company hasn't bought the SQL Anywhere drivers for ASE on top of ASE itself as of today* The only way I have to interact with the database is through a [very old and ugly piece of software called &quot;sqlDbx&quot;][2].* I wanted to have scripting and automation capabilities that the interface couldn't provide, but that bash/powershell/python could.## What is it ?pisql is, for the CLI part, a [rich CLI wrapper][3] around the barebones [isql][4] command line tool that comes with the ASE installation every time.For the python part, it's a small library that allows you to interact with the database through python code.You can turn `.sql` files into dataframes ([pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) or [polars](https://pola.rs)), and further manipulate them.You can use every tool you have in python to interact with the data, vizualize it, etc.## How do I use it ?### InstallationYou can install pisql through pip:```bash    pip install pisql```Although I recommend `pipx`:```bash    pipx install pisql```This works on Windows, Linux and MacOS.### Usage#### CLIThe CLI is fairly simple to use.To execute a single .sql file, you can just use the `exec` command:```bash    pisql exec my_file.sql```which is also aliased to `pisql e my_file.sql` and `pisql x my_file.sql`.To execute multiple .sql files, you can use what I call the &quot;query mode&quot; or &quot;run mode&quot;, using either  the symbols `q`, `run` or `::`. Once this more is activated, you can chain multiple executions together  by using the `++` or `//` commands:```bash    pisql q ++ file_one.sql file_two.sql file_three.sql```An important feature of this mode, is that you can list both files and directories.```bash    pisql :: // file.sql some_dir other_file.sql```What happens then is that pisql will execute sequentially:* `file.sql` first* then all the `.sql` files in `some_dir` second* then `other_file.sql` lastOne nice feature is the presence of rich progress bars like so (give example)**NB:** I haven't had the time to implement further recursion, so if you have a directory in `some_dir`, it will be ignored.#### PythonWill explain in the next few days.## What's next ?I'm currently working on a few things:* [ ] Implementing a config file subcommand to set the default database, user, etc.* [ ] Give more freedom to users to change the storage of the dataframes and config files* [ ] Build a semi ORM to interact with the database through python. Comes to mind the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, etc. clauses.* [ ] Have a little templating feature, but nothing too fancy. I don't want to reinvent the wheel here.* [ ] Use Agg-Grid to have a  web interface to interact with the database. I'm not sure how to do this yet, but I'll figure it out.Here's most of it for now ! I'll update this as I go.[1]: https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/sybase-ase.html[2]: http://www.sqldbx.com/[3]:https://github.com/Textualize/rich[4]:https://infocenter.sybase.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.sybase.infocenter.dc35456.1570/html/ocspsunx/X33477.htm</longdescription>

	<longdescription># Histomic Atlases of Variation Of Cancers (HAVOC)HAVOC is a versatile tool that maps histomic heterogeneity across H&amp;E-stained digital slide images to help guide regional deployment of molecular resources to the most relevant/biodiverse tumor niches## Cloud usageExplore HAVOC on https://www.codido.co to run on the cloud## InstallationUse the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install havoc-clustering.!! Tensorflow will need to be installed as well as OpenSlide (https://openslide.org/download/) !!```bashpip install havoc-clustering```## Usage```pythonfrom havoc_clustering.havoc import HAVOCfrom havoc_clustering.general_utility.slide import Slide# create a new Slide object that represents the image.# Requirements allow to filter out undesired images within ie a loops = Slide(    slide_path,    img_requirements={        'compression': [70],        'mpp': None  # all mpp values (magnification) are supported currently    })# to instantiate a HAVOC instance requires the following:# 1. a Slide object# 2. path to a tensorflow model which acts as the feature extractor to base clustering off of.     # Our model used in our works can be found at https://bitbucket.org/diamandislabii/faust-feature-vectors-2019/src/master/models/74_class/# 3. the directory to save output to# 4. size of the tiles to extract and work with within the slide. default is 1024 (original trained size for the model above)# 5. by default, we use the slide's resized thumbnail as the background for the colortile map. turn off to make it HD at the expense of timehavoc = HAVOC(s, feature_extractor_path, save_dir, tile_size=512, hd_backdrop=False)# to run, requires the following:# 1. the k values to use for clustering# 2. the blank filter cutoff. 0.5 means that there must be less than (100-50=50)% blank within a tile to decide to use it.    # ie tiles that are &gt;50% blank would be skipped; a non-conservative number to only cluster tiles with plentiful tissue# 3. the layer name within the feature extractor model that is responsible for generating the features# 4. Additional kwargs; OPTIONALkwargs = {    # saves a thumbnail image of the original slide    'save_thumbnail': False,    # make a dendrogram of the clustering used to make the colortile maps (generated for each k value)    'make_dendrogram': True,    # make a tsne of each color cluster (generated for each k value)    'make_tsne': True,    # make a Pearson coeffcient clustermap of each color cluster (generated for each k value)    'make_corr_map': True,    # save the tiles belonging to each color cluster within the colortile map for a given k    # ie [4,9] would save the colored tiles belonging to k=4 and k=9    # NOTE: this should be a subset of k_vals    'save_tiles_k_vals': []}havoc.run(k_vals=[9], min_non_blank_amt=0.5, layer_name='global_average_pooling2d_1', **kwargs)```## Result output- Colortiled maps- CSV file of cluster info + DLFVs (cluster_info_df.csv)- Optionally:    - Original slide thumbnail    - TSNEs    - Dendrograms    - Correlation clustermap## Multi-slide correlation mapBy running HAVOC on multiple slides, you may want to combine all the generated correlation clustermaps into a mega clustermap.1. Create a folder containing each slide's cluster_info_df.csv file2. ```pythonfrom havoc_clustering.correlation_of_dlfv_groups import create_correlation_clustermap_multi_slidecreate_correlation_clustermap_multi_slide(folder_of_csvs, target_k=9)```NOTE: the target_k should be a k-value you ran HAVOC with ## CitationPlease refer to the paper &quot;HAVOC: Small-scale histomic mapping of biodiversity across entire tumor specimens using deep neural networks&quot;## License[GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt)</longdescription>

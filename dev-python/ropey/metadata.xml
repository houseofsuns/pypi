Ropey is fast, robust, and can handle huge texts and memory-incoherent edits with ease.*PyRopey aims to provide the performance and accessible interface of Rope into Python's world.## Installing`PyRopey` is available in any platform and can be installed with `pip`:```pip install ropey```*Note: PyRopey is currently in pre-release status and major changes are to be expected*.## Example UsageAdapted from Ropey's example.```pythonfrom ropey import Rope# Load a text file.let text = Rope.from_file(&quot;my_great_book.txt&quot;)# Print the 516th line (zero-indexed).print(text.line(515))  # Not implemented yet# Get the start/end char indices of the line.let start_idx = text.line_to_char(515)  # Not implemented yetlet end_idx = text.line_to_char(516)# Remove the line...text.remove(slice(start_idx, end_idx))# ...and replace it with something better.text.insert(start_idx, &quot;The flowers are... so... dunno.\n&quot;)# Print the changes, along with the previous few lines for context.let start_idx = text.line_to_char(511)let end_idx = text.line_to_char(516)print(text.slice(slice(start_idx, end_idx)))  # Not implemented yet# Write the file back out to disk.text.write_to_file(&quot;my_great_book.txt&quot;)```PyRopey's philosophy is to provide an API that is as close as possible to the original methods in Ropey. This is why we recommend using their [documentation](https://docs.rs/ropey/latest/ropey/index.html) for more details.## ContributingContributions are more than welcome! Here are a few objectives:- [ ] Implement (almost) every methods from `ropey::Rope`- [ ] Write Python tests for every method- [ ] Write stubs for every method- [ ] Document every method- [ ] Create docs, hosted on ReadTheDocs- [ ] Build automated benchmarks to compared `ropey` with builtin alternatives[pypi-version-badge]: https://img.shields.io/pypi/djversions/ropey?label=Ropey[pypi-version-url]: https://pypi.org/project/ropey/[pypi-python-version-badge]: https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/ropey[github-ci-img]: https://github.com/jeertmans/pyropey/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg[github-ci]: https://github.com/jeertmans/pyropey/actions?query=workflow%3Aci[docs-rtd-url]: https://pyropey.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest[docs-rtd-img]: https://readthedocs.org/projects/pyropey/badge/?version=latest</longdescription>

	<longdescription>&lt;H1&gt;Bayes Nets and Sampling&lt;/H1&gt;## About: Developed code from scratch to compute an input probability query on a given Bayes net on discrete random variables using Prior sampling, Rejection Sampling, Likelihood weighting and Gibbs sampling. &lt;br&gt;I had also written helper function to generate samples from any input univariate discrete distribution and then use it in your Bayes Net sampling code.## BayesNets Class:I implemented a BayesNets Class to do all the required task and computations.&lt;br&gt;Basically I created a single class to do all the calculation, extractions of details from the file as well as implement all the sampling methods and sample generation.## Install the Python Package```pip install bayes-nets-sample```## Import the Python Package```from bayes import bayesNets```## To see the Sample .txt file```from bayes.sample_input_txt import SampleInputTXTSampleInputTXT().generate_sample()```## To Get more information about the BayesNets Class as well as its methods:### run the following command:```help(BayesNets)```## Lets Start By Creating an object of BayesNets and extract the information from the file:```bayesNet = BayesNets(filepath = &quot;example_bayesnet.txt&quot;)```## Let's Print The Extracted Information: ```print(bayesNet)```## Let's See how a single sample is generated:```bayesNet.generateSample()```## Now Lets Calculate the Query result using Prior Sampling Method:`With verbose = True````bayesNet.doPriorSampling(TOTAL_SAMPLE = 10000, verbose = True)```## Now Lets Calculate the Query result using Prior Sampling Method:`With verbose = False`- Just to see the final result.```bayesNet.doPriorSampling(TOTAL_SAMPLE = 10000, verbose = False)```## Now Lets Calculate the Query result using Rejection Sampling Method:`With verbose = True````bayesNet.doRejectionSampling(TOTAL_SAMPLE_REQUIRED = 10000, verbose = True)```## Now Lets Calculate the Query result using Rejection Sampling Method:`With verbose = False`- Just to see the final result.```bayesNet.doRejectionSampling(TOTAL_SAMPLE_REQUIRED = 10000, verbose = False)```## Let's See how a single weighted sample is generated:```bayesNet.generateWeightedSample(verbose = True)```## Now Lets Calculate the Query result using Likelihood Weighting Method:`With verbose = True````bayesNet.doLikelihoodWeighting(TOTAL_SAMPLE = 10000, verbose = True)```## Now Lets Calculate the Query result using Likelihood Weighting Method:`With verbose = False`- Just to see the final result.```bayesNet.doLikelihoodWeighting(TOTAL_SAMPLE = 10000, verbose = False)```## Sample File```5, B, E, A, J, MB, +b, -bE, +e, -eA, +a, -aJ, +j, -jM, +m, -mB |+b, 0.001-b, 0.999E |+e, 0.002-e, 0.998A | B,E+b, +e, +a, 0.95+b, +e, -a, 0.05+b, -e, +a, 0.94+b, -e, -a, 0.06-b, +e, +a, 0.29-b, +e, -a, 0.71-b, -e, +a, 0.001-b, -e, -a, 0.999J | A+a, +j, 0.9+a, -j, 0.1-a, +j, 0.05-a, -j, 0.95M | A+a, +m, 0.7+a, -m, 0.3-a, +m, 0.01-a, -m, 0.99Query: P( B=+b| J=+j)```</longdescription>

It focuses onintegration and orchestration, like study routing, event notifications and audit logging.* Free software: GNU Affero General Public License v3* Documentation: https://orthanc-server-extensions.readthedocs.io.Features--------* easily plug event handling scripts for all Orthanc's `change events`_ -* chain functions into a pipeline (composition)* run asyncio functions (coroutines) for concurrent processing of a change event* run (integration) tests for your Orthanc python scripts* publish events to Kafka, RabbitMQ and NATSModules-------* auto_retries: retry failed jobs* auto_forward: forward DICOM to external systems based on python match functions* anonymization: anonymize DICOM Series using the Orthanc APIWhy this library was written----------------------------Improve developer happiness: the development roundtrip is just a little bit long to build, run and test a function, even with Docker.With this library, you can start from the unit tests, move to integration tests, and then deploy the result in the Docker image.Enable testability: the Orthanc API is provided as a module which is not easy to mock in a clean way.Orthanc server extensions provide a few simple abstractions that keep functions clean and independently testable.Improve performance: async functions will be executed concurrently, which is advantageous if the processing is I/O bound.Httpx was chosen as a base library to access the Orthanc API, rather than orthanc.RestApi*, because it is well known,developer friendly, and external API access avoids deadlocks in the Python plugin (before this was solved in 3.1).Running-------``entry_point.py`` provides the first boilerplate to get started. Run it by issuing``docker-compose up --build``; you should be greeted with 'orthanc started event handled!' message, which is also published toDeveloping----------Write your event handling scripts and register them in ``event_dispatcher.register_event_handlers()``. Examples,including the use of async functions and function composition (pipeline), can be found in ``tests/test_event_dispatcher.py``.Credits-------This project would obviously not exist without Orthanc, its documentation and its community.This package was created with Cookiecutter_ and the `audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`_ project template... _change events: https://book.orthanc-server.com/plugins/python.html#listening-to-changes)... _Cookiecutter: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter.. _`audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage=======History=======3.5.0 (2023-10-12)------------------* Support pyOrthanc as Orthanc API client3.4.0 (2023-06-21)------------------* Improved asyncio performance3.3.0 (2023-01-30)------------------* Publish Orthanc change events to Kafka, RabbitMQ and NATS* Run asyncio functions (coroutines) for concurrent processing of a change event* Chain functions into a pipeline (composition)3.2.8 (2021-09-18)------------------* get_metadata_of_first_instance_of_series() now propagates http errors if /instances call fails.3.2.7 (2021-09-17)------------------* Small resilience fix for httpx (more conservative timeouts)* get_metadata_of_first_instance_of_series() will now return None for unknown keys3.2.6 (2021-09-16)------------------* Replace requests/responses library by httpx/respx* Add support for anonymization and re-identification using study merge* Many smaller and bigger refactorings* Dependency updates3.1.1 (2021-02-11)------------------* Add DICOM auto forwarding sample with retries3.1.0 (2021-02-07)------------------* Improved logging, aligned log format and levels with Orthanc.0.1.0 (2021-01-09)------------------* First release on PyPI.</longdescription>

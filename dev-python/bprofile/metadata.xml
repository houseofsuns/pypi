	<longdescription>bprofile 1.3************`Chris Billington &lt;mailto:chrisjbillington@gmail.com&gt;`_, February 28, 2015*bprofile* is a wrapper around *cProfile*, *gprof2dot* and *graphviz*,providing a simple context manager for profiling sections of Pythoncode and producing visual graphs of profiling results. It works onWindows and Unix.`View on PyPI &lt;http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bprofile&gt;`_| `Get the source from BitBucket &lt;http://bitbucket.org/cbillington/bprofile&gt;`_| `Read the docs at readthedocs &lt;http://bprofile.readthedocs.org&gt;`_Installation============to install *bprofile*, run:::   $ pip install bprofileor to install from source:::   $ python setup.py installNote:  *bprofile* requires graphviz to be installed. *bprofile* looks for a  *graphviz* installation folder in ``C:\Program Files`` or  ``C:\Program Files (x86)`` on Windows, and for *graphviz*  executables in the ``PATH`` on Unix.Introduction============Every time I need to profile some Python code I go through the samesteps: looking up *cProfile*'s docs, and then reading about*gprof2dot* and *graphviz*. And then it turns out the code I want toprofile is a GUI callback or something, and I don't want to profilethe whole program because it spends most of its time doing nothing.*cProfile* certainly has this functionality, which I took one look at,and thought: *This should be a context manager, and when it exits, itshould call gprof2dot and graphviz automatically so I don't have toremember their command line arguments, and so I don't accidentallyprint a .png to standard output and have to listen to all the ASCIIbeep characters.*``BProfile`` provides this functionality.Example usage=============::   # example.py   import os   import time   import pylab as pl   from bprofile import BProfile   def do_some_stuff():       for i in range(100):           time.sleep(.01)   def do_some_stuff_that_wont_be_profiled():       os.system('ping -c 5 google.com')   def do_some_more_stuff(n):       x = pl.rand(100000)       for i in range(100):           time.sleep(.01)           x = pl.fft(x)   profiler = BProfile('example.png')   with profiler:       do_some_stuff()   do_some_stuff_that_wont_be_profiled()   with profiler:       do_some_more_stuff(5)The above outputs the following image ``example.png`` in the currentworking directory:.. image:: https://bitbucket.org/cbillington/bprofile/raw/default/doc/example.pngsee  ``BProfile`` for more information on usage.Class reference===============**class bprofile.BProfile(output_path, threshold_percent=2.5,report_interval=5, enabled=True)**   A profiling context manager.   A context manager that after it exits, outputs a .png file of a   graph made via cProfile, gprof2dot and graphviz. The context   manager can be used multiple times, and if used repeatedly,   regularly updates its output to include cumulative results.   An instance can also be used as a decorator, it will simply wrap   calls to the decorated method in the profiling context.   :Parameters:      * **output_path** (*str*) -- The name of the .png report file        you would like to output. '.png' will be appended if not        present.      * **threshold_percent** (*int or float*) -- Nodes in which        execution spends less than this percentage of the total        profiled execution time will not be included in the output.      * **report_interval** (*int or float*) -- The minimum time, in        seconds, in between output file generation. If the context        manager exits and it has not been at least this long since the        last output was generated, output generation will be delayed        until it has been. More profiling can run in the meantime.        This is to decrease overhead on your program, (even though        this overhead will only be incurred when no code is being        profiled), while allowing you to have ongoing results of the        profiling while your code is still running. If you only use        the context manager once, then this argument has no effect. If        you set it to zero, output will be produced after every exit        of the context.      * **enabled** (*bool*) -- Whether the profiler is enabled or        not. Equivalent to calling ``set_enabled()`` with this        argument after instantiation. Useful for enabling and        disabling profiling with a global flag when you do not have        easy access to the instance - for example when using as a        decorator.   -[ Notes ]-   The profiler will return immediately after the context manager, and   will generate its .png report in a separate thread. If the same   context manager is used multiple times output will be generated at   most every ``report_interval`` seconds (default: 5). The delay is   to allow blocks to execute many times in between reports, rather   than slowing your program down with generating graphs all the time.   This means that if your profile block is running rapidly and   repeatedly, a new report will be produced every ``report_interval``   seconds.   Pending reports will be generated at interpreter shutdown.   Note that even if ``report_interval`` is short, reporting will not   interfere with the profiling results themselves, as a lock is   acquired that will prevent profiled code from running at the same   time as the report generation code. So the overhead produced by   report generation does not affect the results of profiling - this   overhead will only affect portions of your code that are not being   profiled.   The lock is shared between instances, and so you can freely   instantiate many ``BProfile`` instances to profile different parts   of your code. Instances with the same ``output_path`` will share an   underlying cProfile profiler, and so their reports will be   combined. Profile objects are thread safe, so a single instance can   be shared as well anywhere in your program.   Warning:     Since only one profiler can be running at a time, two profiled     pieces of code in different threads waiting on each other in any     way will deadlock.   **__call__(function)**      Returns a wrapped version of ``function`` with profiling.      Intended for use as a decorator.   **do_report()**      Collect statistics and output a .png file of the profiling      report.      -[ Notes ]-      This occurs automatically at a rate of ``report_interval``, but      one can call this method to report results sooner. The report      will include results from all ``BProfile`` instances that have      the same ``output_path`` and no more automatic reports (if      further profiling is done) will be produced until after the      minimum ``report_interval`` of those instances.      This method can be called at any time and is threadsafe. It is      not advisable to call it during profiling however as this will      incur overhead that will affect the profiling results. Only      automatic reports are guaranteed to be generated when no      profiling is taking place.   **set_enabled(enabled)**      Set whether profiling is enabled.      if enabled==True, all methods work as normal. Otherwise      ``start()``, ``stop()``, and ``do_report()`` become dummy      methods that do nothing. This is useful for having a global      variable to turn profiling on or off, based on whether one is      debugging or not, or to enable or disable profiling of different      parts of code selectively.      If profiling is running when this method is called to disable      it, the profiling will be stopped.   **start()**      Begin profiling.   **stop()**      Stop profiling.      Stop profiling and outptut a profiling report, if at least      ``report_interval`` has elapsed since the last report. Otherwise      output the report after a delay.      Does not preclude starting profiling again at a  later time.      Results are cumulative.</longdescription>

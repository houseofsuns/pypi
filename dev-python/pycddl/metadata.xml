	<longdescription># PyCDDL: A CDDL validation library for Python[CDDL](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8610.html) is a schema language for the CBOR serialization format.`pycddl` allows you to validate CBOR documents match a particular CDDL schema, based on the Rust [`cddl`](https://github.com/anweiss/cddl) library.For example, here we use the [`cbor2`](https://pypi.org/project/cbor2/) library to serialize a dictionary to CBOR, and then validate it:```pythonfrom pycddl import Schemaimport cbor2uint_schema = Schema(&quot;&quot;&quot;    object = {        xint: uint    }&quot;&quot;&quot;)uint_schema.validate_cbor(cbor2.dumps({&quot;xint&quot;, -2}))```If validation fails, a `pycddl.ValidationError` is raised.### Reducing memory usage and safety constraintsIn order to reduce memory usage, you can pass in any Python object that implements the buffer API and stores bytes, e.g. a `memoryview()` or a `mmap` object.**The passed-in object must be read-only, and the data must not change during validation!**If you mutate the data while validation is happening the result can be memory corruption or other [undefined behavior](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18506029/can-undefined-behavior-erase-the-hard-drive#comment27209771_18506029).## Release notes### 0.5.0* Support for ARM macOS.* Dropped Python 3.7 support.### 0.4.1* Test fixes, with no user-relevant changes.### 0.4.0* `validate_cbor()` now accepts read-only buffers, not just `bytes`. This is useful if you want to e.g. validate a large file, since you can `mmap()` it.* The GIL is released when parsing documents larger than 10KiB.### 0.3.0* Fixed major bug where if the document was valid UTF-8, the library would attempt to parse it as JSON!* Added support for ARM macOS.### 0.2.2* Updated to `cddl` 0.9.1.### 0.2.1* Added PyPy wheels.### 0.2.0* Schemas are now only parsed once (when the `Schema()` object is created), instead of every time validation happens, which should improve validation performance.* Updated to a newer version of [underlying CDDL library](https://github.com/anweiss/cddl), which should make CDDL parsing more compliant.* Added a `repr()` implementation to `Schema` for easier debugging.### 0.1.11* Initial release.</longdescription>

If you need a pythonic way tocreate, fine tune and populate `MarkLogic 8`_ databases and clusters, you mayprefer `MarkLogic_Python &lt;https://github.com/paul-hoehne/MarkLogic_Python&gt;`_.Hey! Where are the docs=======================As above written, this package is at an early stage of development, andwriting a cool doc with an API and features that may change before the firstbeta release is a waste of time.Meanwhile, you may read and play with the code that's in the ``sandbox/``directory that explores most features of the provided resources.Installation============Jump to `Contributing`_ if you want the full source distro and contribute tothe project.

If you can see its home page in your browser, it's OK- Running a MarkLogic 8 REST tests instance at http://localhost:8000 with  username and password being both ``admin``. If you prefer to use another  instance listening on port ``9000`` of host ``my.marklogic-rest.tld`` and  which user is ``foo`` authenticated by password ``bar``, you need to provide  this in a ``MLLIB_TEST_SERVER`` environment variable that contains  ``my.marklogic-rest.tld:9000:foo:bar``.  if your MarkLogic REST server expects an HTTP Basic Authentication token, append  ``:basic`` to the ``MLLIB_TEST_SERVER`` environment variable. Otherwise an HTTP  Digest Auth token will be issued... code:: console  $ export MLLIB_TEST_SERVER=my.marklogic-rest.tld:9000:foo:bar  # Optional  $ python setup.py test  $ python run_tests.pyBuild the Sphinx documentation------------------------------.. code:: console   $ python setup.py build_sphinx   $ firefox build/sphinx/html/index.htmlContributing============- Register to `Github &lt;https://github.com/&gt;`_ if not already done.- Please file a ticket at the `Github tracker  &lt;https://github.com/glenfant/stopit/issues&gt;`_ that explains your feature or  improvement.- Fork the project in your personal repository- Do the job- Always check the existing unit tests (see above) and add unit tests that  verify your feature or bugfix.- Prefer &quot;git rebase&quot; to &quot;git merge&quot; when synching with the original master.

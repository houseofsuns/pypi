If you need an extra wheel, compile it yourselfor just drop me an [issue](https://github.com/smok-serwis/tempsdb/issues/new).If you're installing it somewhere that you don't need both snakehouseand tempsdb installed, compile your own binary wheel with```python setup.py bdist_wheel```Then copy your resulting wheel and install it via pip on the target system.Be aware that tempsdb does logging. Consult the docs for how to disable it.# Changelog## v0.6.4* fixed a bug with slicing chunks in `VarlenSeries`* added extra comparison operators for `VarlenEntry`* added `sync` to `VarlenSeries`* fixed a bug with not propagating metadata write exceptions* fixed a bug with `Database` treating `varlen` and metadata as real time series## v0.6.3* added logging for opening and closing series## v0.6.2* added the context manager syntax to VarlenIterator* fixed a memory leak that happened during getting current value    from an empty series* added `MemoryPressureManager` support for `Database`## v0.6.1* fixed an issue with `Iterators`## v0.6* **bugfix**: fixed some bugs with reading values after close* added support for storing metadata as minijson    * this will be enabled by default is minijson is importable* fixed minor compiler warnings* `TimeSeries.iterate_range` will accept a parameter called  `direct_bytes` for compatibility with `VarlenSeries`.  It's value is ignored* more class constructors use explicit typing - faster tempsdb* `TimeSeries.get_current_value` will correctly raise `ValueError` instead of returning None## v0.5.4* older TempsDB databases that do not support varlens will be updated upon opening* added metadata support for databases* a flush will be done before re-enabling mmap* bugfix to read archive data## v0.5.3* added `disable_mmap`, `enable_mmap` and `open_chunks_mmap_size` into `VarlenSeries`## v0.5.2* added multiple properties and attributes to `VarlenSeries`## v0.5.1* added `VarlenSeries.close_chunks`* `Database.sync` will now return 0* indexed-gzip proved to be a poor choice, dropped* `setup.py` fixed## v0.5* if mmap is used, the kernel will be informed after loading the chunk that we   don't need it's memory right now* deleting a `TimeSeries` will now correctly return a zero* both `Database`, `TimeSeries` and `Chunk` destructor will close and   emit a warning if the user forgot to* if page_size is default, it won't be written as part of the metadata* added support for per-series metadata* following additions to `Database`:    * `delete_series`    * `delete_varlen_series`* following additions to `TimeSeries`:    * added `append_padded`    * added metadata support, `metadata` property and `set_metadata` call* added variable length series* added experimental support for gzipping time series* fixed a bug where getting a series that was already closed would TypeError* following additions to `Chunk`:    * `get_slice_of_piece_at`    * `get_slice_of_piece_starting_at`    * `get_byte_of_piece`    * `get_timestamp_at`* fixed the behaviour of `AlternativeMMaps` when passed a single index to __getitem__ and __setitem__* added `StillOpen` exception, chunk won't allow to close itself if it has any  remaining references## v0.4.4* more error conditions during mmap will be supported as well* ENOMEM will be correctly handled during resize operation* added `TimeSeries.descriptor_based_access`* added `Chunk.switch_to_mmap_based_access`## v0.4.3* improving handling mmap failures on too low memory* slightly reduced `metadata.txt` by defaulting `page_size`* moved `Chunk`* added support for gzipping* added `DirectChunk`* iterating and writing at the same time from multiple threads    made safe* added `TimeSeries.disable_mmap`* `Iterator`'s destructor will emit a warning if you forget to close it explicitly.* added option for transparent gzip compression    Please note that gzip disables mmap!* experimental gzip support for constant-length time series## v0.4.2* empty series will return an Iterator* **bugfix release** fixed `Database.create_series`* `Database` constructor will throw if no database is there* changed `Iterator.next` to `Iterator.next_item`,   synce Cython guys said to not implement the method `next`  on iterators.## v0.4.1* **bugfix release** fixed `get_open_series`## v0.4* can install from sdist now## v0.3* added `TimeSeries.get_current_value`* added `Database.sync`## v0.2* added `get_open_series`* added `get_all_series`* added `get_first_entry_for`* added `close_all_open_series`* added `TimeSeries.name`* added option to use descriptor based access instead of mmap* added `TimeSeries.open_chunks_ram_size`## v0.1First release</longdescription>

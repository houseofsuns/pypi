	<longdescription># Xman: another Chia plotting managerThis is a tool for managing [Chia](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain)plotting operations.  The tool runs on the plotting machine and providesthe following functionality:- Automatic spawning of new plotting jobs, possibly overlapping (&quot;staggered&quot;)  on multiple temp directories, rate-limited globally and by per-temp-dirlimits.- Rsync'ing of newly generated plots to a remote host (a farmer/harvester),  called &quot;archiving&quot;.- Monitoring of ongoing plotting and archiving jobs, progress, resources used,  temp files, etc.- Control of ongoing plotting jobs (suspend, resume, plus kill and clean up  temp files).- Both an interactive live dashboard mode as well as command line mode tools.- (very alpha) Analyzing performance statistics of past jobs, to aggregate on  various plotting parameters or temp dir type.Plotman is designed for the following configuration:- A plotting machine with an array of `tmp` dirs, a single `tmp2` dir, and an  array of `dst` dirs to which the plot jobs plot.  The `dst` dirs serve as atemporary buffer space for generated plots.- A farming machine with a large number of drives, made accessible via an  `rsyncd` module, and to be entirely populated with plots.  These are known asthe `archive` directories.- Plot jobs are run with STDOUT/STDERR redirected to a log file in a configureddirectory.  This allows analysis of progress (plot phase) as well as timing(e.g. for analyzing performance).## FunctionalityPlotman tools are stateless.  Rather than keep an internal record of what jobshave been started, Plotman relies on the process tables, open files, andlogfiles of plot jobs to understand &quot;what's going on&quot;.  This means the toolscan be stopped and started, even from a different login session, without lossof information.  It also means Plotman can see and manage jobs started manuallyor by other tools, as long as their STDOUT/STDERR redirected to a file in aknown logfile directory.  (Note: The tool relies on reading the chia plotcommand line arguments and the format of the plot tool output.  Changes inthose may break this tool.)Plot scheduling is done by waiting for a certain amount of wall time since thelast job was started, finding the best (e.g. least recently used) `tmp` dir forplotting, and ensuring that job has progressed to at least a certain point(e.g., phase 2, subphase 5).Plots are output to the `dst` dirs, which serve as a temporary buffer until theyare rsync'd (&quot;archived&quot;) to the farmer/harvester.  The archiver does severalthings to attempt to avoid concurrent IO.  First, it only allows one rsyncprocess at a time (more sophisticated scheduling could remove thisrestriction, but it's nontrivial).  Second, it inspects the pipeline of plotjobs to see which `dst` dirs are about to have plots written to them.  Thisis balanced against how full the `dst` drives are in a priority scheme.It is, obviously, necessary that your rsync bandwidth exceeds your plottingbandwidth.  Given this, in normal operation, the `dst` dirs remain empty untila plot is finished, after which it is shortly thereafter picked up by thearchive job.  However, the decoupling provided by using `dst` drives as abuffer means that should the farmer/harvester or the network becomeunavailable, plotting continues uninterrupted.## Screenshot OverviewThe screenshot shows some of the main features of Plotman.The first line shows the status.  The plotting status shows whether we juststarted a plot, or, if not, why not (e.g., stagger time, tmp directories beingready, etc.; in this case, the 1800s stagger between plots has not been reachedyet).  Archival status says whether we are currently archiving (and providesthe `rsync` pid) or whether there are no plots available in the `dst` drives toarchive.The second line provides a key to some directory abbrevations used throughout.For `tmp` and `dst` directories, we assume they have a common prefix, which iscomputed and indicated here, after which they can be referred to (in context)by their unique suffix.  For example, if we have `tmp` dirs `/mnt/tmp/00`,`/mnt/tmp/01`, `/mnt/tmp/02`, etc., we show `/mnt/tmp` as the prefix here andcan then talk about `tmp` dirs `00` or `01` etc.  The `archive` directories arethe same except that these are paths on a remote host and accessed via an`rsyncd` module (see `src/plotman/resources/plotman.yaml` for details).The next table shows information about the active plotting jobs.  It isabbreviated to show the most and least recently started jobs (the full list isavailable via the command line mode).  It shows various information about theplot jobs, including the plot ID (first 8 chars), the directories used,walltime, the current plot phase and subphase, space used on the `tmp` drive,pid, etc.The next tables are a bit hard to read; there is actually a `tmp` table on theleft which is split into two tables for rendering purposes, and a `dst` tableon the right.  The `tmp` tables show the phases of the plotting jobs usingthem, and whether or not they're ready to take a new plot job.  The `dst` tableshows how many plots have accumulated, how much free space is left, and thephases of jobs that are destined to write to them, and finally, the prioritycomputed for the archive job to move the plots away.The last table simply shows free space of drives on the remoteharverster/farmer.Finally, the last section shows a log of actions performed -- namely, plot andarchive jobs initiated.  This is the one part of the interactive tool which isstateful.  There is no permanent record of these executed command lines, so ifyou start a new interactive plotman session, this log is empty.## Limitations and IssuesThe system is tested on Linux only.  Plotman should be generalizable to otherplatforms, but this is not done yet.  Some of the issues around making callsout to command line programs (e.g., running `df` over `ssh` to obtain the freespace on the remote archive directories) are very linux-y.The interactive mode uses the `curses` library ... poorly.  Keypresses arenot received, screen resizing does not work, and the minimum terminal sizeis pretty big.Plotman assumes all plots are k32s.  Again, this is just an unimplementedgeneralization.Many features are inconsistently supported between either the &quot;interactive&quot;mode or the command line mode.There are many bugs and TODOs.Plotman will always look for the `plotman.yaml` file within your computer at an OS-baseddefault location. To generate a default `plotman.yaml`, run:```shell&gt; plotman config generate```To display the current location of your `plotman.yaml` file and check if it exists, run:```shell&gt; plotman config path```([See also](https://github.com/ericaltendorf/plotman/pull/61#issuecomment-812967363)).## InstallationInstallation for Linux:1. Plotman assumes that a functioning [Chia](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain)   installation is present on the system. Activate your `chia` environment by typing   `source /path/to/your/chia/install/activate`.2. Then, install Plotman using the following command:   ```shell    pip install --force-reinstall git+https://github.com/ericaltendorf/plotman@main    ```   With the new installation we can install this   or with this   ```shell    python3 -m pip install plotmanx   ```3. Plotman will look for `plotman.yaml` within your computer at an OS-based   default location. To create a default `plotman.yaml` and display its location,   run the following command:   ```shell   plotman config generate   ```   The default configuration file used as a starting point is located [here](src/plotmanx/resources/plotman.yaml)4. That's it! You can now run Plotman by typing `plotman version` to verify its version.   Run `plotman --help` to learn about the available commands.### Development note:If you are forking Plotman, simply replace the installation step with `pip install --editable .[dev]` from the project root directory to install *your* version of plotman with test and development extras.# Maintenance## OverviewThis document holds guidance on maintaining aspects of plotman.## Using dockerhttps://gist.github.com/snikch/ab15159e633d21619bdf6a056bec8830## The `chia plots create` CLI parsing codeIn [src/plotman/chia.py](src/plotman/chia.py) there is code copied from the `chia plots create` subcommand's CLI parser definition.When new versions of `chia-blockchain` are released, their interface code should be added to plotman.plotman commit [1b5db4e](https://github.com/ericaltendorf/plotman/commit/1b5db4e342b9ec1f7910663a453aec3a97ba51a6) provides an example of adding a new version.In many cases, copying code is a poor choice.It is believed that in this case it is appropriate since the chia code that plotman could import is not necessarily the code that is parsing the plotting process command lines anyways.The chia command could come from another Python environment, a system package, a `.dmg`, etc.This approach also offers future potential of using the proper version of parsing for the specific plot process being inspected.Finally, this alleviates dealing with the dependency on the `chia-blockchain` package.In generally, using dependencies is good.This seems to be an exceptional case.</longdescription>

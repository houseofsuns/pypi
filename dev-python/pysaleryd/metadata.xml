Follow steps in the manual.* Confirm websocket port by connecting to the UI using a browser and take note of websocket port using debug console in browser. 3001 is probably default* The system HRV system can only handle a few connected clients. Shut down any additional clients/browsers and try againDisclaimer==========Use at own risk.This project is in no way affiliated with the manufacturer.

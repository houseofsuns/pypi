[Useful resources](#useful-resources)# GoalThe goal of CI is to automate code formatting, validation, deployment and publishing of packages. # WorkflowA CI pipeline is triggered when new code is pushed to a remote repository.Every CI pipeline does at least:1. Code formatting    * Apply automated linting on source code    * Push back the formatted code to the remote repository2. Code validation    * Testing (unit tests, integration tests, doctests)    * Docstring validation (only for frameworks)3. Deployment to an integration environment for applications / Publishing for frameworks -- (only on *master* and only if the *Validation* step succeeded)    * Semi-automated versioning (see the [Versioning](#versioning) section) + Tag the repository with the new generated version number    * Packaging    * Deployment / Publishing# Results and LogsYou can see your CI pipeline's result and logs:* From your **GitLab project page &amp;rarr; CI/CD &amp;rarr; Pipelines*** From your **GitHub project page &amp;rarr; Actions &amp;rarr; Continuous Integration**# VersioningVersioning is semi-automatically resolved: if you want the major or minor part to be bumped, you only have to add ***[bump major]*** or ***[bump minor]*** to your commit message on *master* (versioning is not applied to other branches).Example, the current version number is **1.0.5**.If you commit with the following message:```Added some new stuff.```the new version number will be **1.0.6**.But if you commit with the following message:```Added some great new stuff! [bump minor]```the new version number will be **1.1.0**.Finally, if you commit with the following message:```Added some extraordinary new stuff!!! [bump major]```the new version number will be **2.0.0**.# Skip CIYou can prevent the CI pipeline from being triggered by adding ***[skip ci]*** to your commit message.Example:```Updated the README file. [skip ci]```**Be careful!** If you skip the CI process, any new code will not be validated and no new version will be deployed/published. So, think twice before using it.# HostingCI pipelines for GitHub public repositories are run on GitHub-hosted runners. See the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/learn-github-actions/introduction-to-github-actions#runners) for more details# How to setup CIThis &quot;How to&quot; section applies to python package projects only. If you want to setup CI to an application project or another programing language, you will have to modify the CI pipeline definition according to your needs.## For a GitHub repository1. Add this [ci.yml](resources/ci.yml) file to the `github/workflow/` directory (create the directory if it doesn't exist) into your local repository.Note that [wads](https://pypi.org/project/wads/) does it for you by running the following command from the project's root directory (documentation [here](https://i2mint.github.io/wads/module_docs/wads/populate.html)):``` populate . --root-url=GITHUB_ROOT_URL```Note that you can specify the root directory (in case you're not in the root directory), root url (in case the directory is not already associated to a git repo), and have many other parametrization choices. Fear not: `populate` will **not** create or modify the `ci.yml` file (or any other file) if there is one already. 2. In the `ci.yml` file, replace `#PROJECT_NAME#` with the project name (must be the exact same name as the main module of the project, not needed if you ran the `populate` tool because it did it for you) and modify the pipeline workflow to suit the project's needs. Documentation [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions).3. Add secrets `PYPI_USERNAME` and `PYPI_PASSWORD` with your PYPI credentials to the remote repository. Documentation [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets).4. If you want the project's documentation to be published, configure the project's Github Pages for the project by selecting the `/docs` folder. Documentation [here](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/).5. Push your code and see the execution of the new `Continuous Integration` workflow. Documentation [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/managing-workflow-runs).Consider using [wads](https://pypi.org/project/wads/) to automatically validate your code locally, commit and push by running the following command (documentation [here](https://i2mint.github.io/wads/module_docs/wads/pack.html)):```pack check-in 'Your commit message.'```# Useful resources[troubleshooting tests](https://github.com/i2mint/tested/wiki/Troubleshooting-Tests)</longdescription>

And if you are not happy with the structure of the result, dict2graph comes with a bunch of, transformation tools, which are easy to apply to your model.### Difference compared to apoc.load.json* Client side python parsing (no [database setting](https://neo4j.com/labs/apoc/4.1/overview/apoc.load/apoc.load.json/#_reading_from_a_file) for file loading is necessary)* Iterative transforming of the json model to a graph model. You dont need to understand the complete json structure from the begining to load it into Neo4j.* More resiliant against changes and irregularities in the json source. ### Recommended workflowThe recommended workflow is:- Load your dict (or a sample of your larger datasets) as it is, with dict2graph into a neo4j test instance- Inspect the result in neo4j- Add dict2graph-transformers to shape your resulting graph model- Wipe your neo4j test instance- Repeat the work flow with the changed dict2graph-transformers until your happy with the result### What dict2graph is **not**dict2graph can **not** be used for de-/serializing your dict into a graph database. There is no `graph2dict` functionality (nore is it planned to have one).  Your data/dict will be transformed to be more suitable in a graph represantation. On the way, certain informations can be lost. Reproducing the exact same dict from the graph is not possible in many cases.## py2neo depcrecation warningIn past versions of `dict2graph`, the awesome [`py2neo`](https://py2neo.org/2021.1/) library was the only way to connect to a Neo4j instance.  But (sadly) this lib is in a low-maintanance mode. For now it is still supported but marked as deprecated. We recommend to switch to the official [Neo4j Python Driver](https://neo4j.com/docs/api/python-driver/current/). ## Basic Usage ExampleWith formalities out of the way, lets have some simple examples how dict2graph works...### Load a dict```pythonfrom dict2graph import Dict2graphfrom neo4j import GraphDatabase# connect to our neo4j databaseNEO4J_DRIVER = GraphDatabase.driver(&quot;neo4j://localhost&quot;)# lets create a small random  dictdic = {    &quot;action&quot;: {        &quot;id&quot;: 1,        &quot;target&quot;: &quot;El Oued&quot;,        &quot;entities&quot;: [{&quot;id&quot;: &quot;Isabelle Eberhardt&quot;}, {&quot;id&quot;: &quot;Slimène Ehnni&quot;}],    }}# create a dict2graph instance, # parse the dict # and load it into our neo4j instance.Dict2graph().parse(dic).create(NEO4J_DRIVER)```This will result in following graph:![](dict2graph_docs/img/readme_basic_example.png &quot;Result example 1&quot;)### Transform the modelWe now have loaded the dict data into a Neo4j Graph. But usally we dont need stuff like explicit `list`s in a graph. Also it is common to uppercase relationship types and capitalize labels.So we need to make some adjustments to improve the graph represenation of the dict.  This is where `dict2graph.Transformer`s come into play.```pythonfrom dict2graph import Dict2graph, Transformer, NodeTrans, RelTransfrom py2neo import GraphNEO4J_DRIVER = GraphDatabase.driver(&quot;neo4j://localhost&quot;)data = {    &quot;action&quot;: {        &quot;id&quot;: 1,        &quot;target&quot;: &quot;El Oued&quot;,        &quot;entities&quot;: [{&quot;id&quot;: &quot;Isabelle Eberhardt&quot;}, {&quot;id&quot;: &quot;Slimène Ehnni&quot;}],    }}d2g = Dict2graph()d2g.add_transformation(    [        Transformer.match_nodes().do(NodeTrans.CapitalizeLabels()),        Transformer.match_rels().do(RelTrans.UppercaseRelationType()),        Transformer.match_nodes().do(NodeTrans.PopListHubNodes()),    ])d2g.parse(data)d2g.create(NEO4J_DRIVER)```Now that looks more like a graph we are used to, isn't it?![](dict2graph_docs/img/readme_basic_example_trans.png &quot;Result example 1&quot;) There are a lot of more powerful [`Transformer`s](https://dzd-ev.github.io/dict2graph-docs/list_generic_transformer) and you can even [make your own](https://dzd-ev.github.io/dict2graph-docs/diy_transformer/) 🚀!

	<longdescription>gocli - GenomOncology Command Line Interface============================================This is a proprietary package that is available from [GenomOncology] and workswith our [Knowledge Management System].For more information about licensing please contact us at:info@genomoncology.com    Additional proprietary projects available for download via pypi include:* [GO VCF] - GenomOncology Variant Call File &quot;call&quot; generator* [GO SDK] - GenomOncology Software Development Kit    Our open source projects include:* [Related] - Nested Object Models in Python with dictionary, YAML, and JSON transformation support* [Specd] - Swagger v2 Specification Directories* [Rigor] - HTTP-based DSL for for validating RESTful APIsOverview--------The GenomOncology Command Line Interface (CLI) is a command line tool built to bedropped into Bioinformatics pipelines. GO CLI is a &quot;high performance&quot; ETL tool thatunderstands genomics and directly integrates with the GO KMS via REST API callsfor the following functionality:* Variant HGVS Calculation (g., p., c.)* Variant Annotation (e.g. gnomAD, dbSNP, etc.)* Variant Classification (e.g. ACGM or AMP Tiers)* Gene and Protein Information* Clinical Trial Matching* Therapeutic Matching* Variant Warehouse Loading and QueryingHigh Performance----------------&quot;High performance&quot; is achieved through functional programming that minimizesmemory consumption and asynchronous programming style (async/await, asyncio) thatmaximizes concurrency in high IO situations.Examples--------Generate BED file from List of Genes    gocli genes.txt genes.bed annotate_genes to_tsvFilter VCF by BED, Filters, Quality, Mutation Type, and Population Frequency    gocli demo_1.vcf demo_1.filtered.vcf \        from_vcf --bed=./snv_cancer.bed \        filter_in quality GTE 100 \        filter_in vaf GTE &quot;0.05&quot; \        annotate_calls \        retain &quot;annotations.clinvar__CLNSIG__string&quot; HAS &quot;Pathogenic&quot;        filter_in annotations.canonical_mutation_type IN @mt.txt \        filter_out annotations.GNOMAD__AF__mfloat GT &quot;0.01&quot; \        to_vcfCommands--------    $ gocli --help      add_flag             Add flag based on BED file value/presence.      aggregate_csv        Rolls up CSV records using a specified key.      aggregate_tsv        Rolls up TSV records using a specified key.      annotate_calls       Get annotations for stream of calls.      annotate_genes       Get gene objects by stream of names.      annotate_match       Get annotations for CSRA.      annotate_match_bed   Get annotations for gene(s).      distinct             Remove duplicates from a list of strings.      extract              Extract a specific field from object stream.      filter_in            Filter in objects that match comparison.      filter_out           Filter out objects that match comparison.      flatten              Flatten list of lists into a list of strings.      from_bed             Read records from a BED file source.      from_csv             Parses CSV into name-value pair objects.      from_excel           Parses Excel into name-value pair objects.      from_maf             Read records from a MAF file source.      from_source          Parse file into name-value pair objects.      from_tsv             Parses TSV into name-value pair objects.      from_vcf             Parses VCF into variant calls objects.      invoke               Invoke an external function.      load_annotations     Loads variant objects into annotations core.      load_warehouse       Loads variants to warehouse.      match_contents       Match contents by variants and disease.      match_therapies      Match therapies by variants and disease.      match_trials         Match trials by variants and disease.      refresh_annotations  Rebuilds annotations merged core.      region_search        Searches for Transcript in region specified...      retain               Always keep objects that match comparison.      swagger              Launches local Swagger UI webserver.      to_excel             Render objects to Excel file format.      to_pretty            Render indented, syntax highlighted JSON.      to_python            Render python objects without JSON transform.      to_tsv               Render objects to TSV file format.      to_vcf               Render calls to VCF file format.      transform            Transform input stream to output type.[GenomOncology]: https://genomoncology.com/[Knowledge Management System]: https://genomoncology.com/solutions/clinical-oncology/[Related]: https://github.com/genomoncology/related[Specd]: https://github.com/genomoncology/specd [Rigor]: https://github.com/genomoncology/rigor [GO VCF]: https://pypi.org/project/govcf/[GO SDK]: https://pypi.org/project/gosdk/</longdescription>

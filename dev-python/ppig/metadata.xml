	<longdescription># PPIG: A simple AI terminal assistantExample:* Input:```bash➜ ppig list only directories              ls -d */The command has been copied to the clipboard➜ ```Make sure your device has some sort of clipboard system such as `xclip`. If it doesn't you can install it executing: ```bash➜ sudo apt-get install xclip```## Config`ppig` uses OpenAI API. In order to use this API you need to be signed up in OpenAI as well as an API key. ([get it here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys))Once you have your API key, you have two options:1. Create a `ppig_cfg.yaml` file in the directory from which you will call `ppig`. Choosing this option you won't be able to use ppig outside of that foler.2. Create the path `~/.ppig/ppig_cfg.yaml`. Choosing this option you will be able to use ppig from any folder.In both cases, the `ppig_cfg.yaml` muste be like this:```YAMLapi_key: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX```Replace `XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` with your API key.</longdescription>

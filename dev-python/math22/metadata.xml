	<longdescription>This project provides 10 functions that can help mathematics computation and code evaluation.Is_prime (num) function is used to judge whether a number is prime.  Input should be a number above zero and output is true or false.Function of is_square(num) is used to judge if a number is square number by commutating its square root. input should be a number above zero and result is true or false.The quad_equation_1unknown (a, b, c) function is used to compute the root of equation of two degree. 3 input values are coefficients of equation. the results are roots of quadratic equation with one unknown. If there is no solution for this equation, the result will be “none”. If all inputs are zero, the result will be “not an equation”The function of fib(num) is to compute the nth number in Fibonacci sequence . The functions [random _method1(len1), random_method2(len1) and random_all(len1)] can provide a random password with an input length of password. The function “random_method1” includes all letters (both upper case and lower case). The function “random_method2” includes all letters and numbers. The function “random_all” includes all printable characters (except whitespaces).The next function is “level(string1)” that is used to evaluate level of password. You should give a string object to the function and it will return the strength grade of this password. The levels from good to bad are [perfect, very good, very strong, average, low and too low]. It has an attach function “level_store” and it is only used to support the “level” function.The function of encode(st) is used to encode a string by using an encryption algorithm. Every character of this string will be replaced by next character in alphabet. The space will be replaced to the character “!”.(there is a new object too,but it's not completed)(version 2.1.7, 3rd January, 2020 add)Function “line_equation_2unknown(a, b, u, c, d, v)”gives the root of a linear equation in two unknowns ”ax+by=u, cx+dy=v”.If it has no roots, the result will be none.(version 2.2, 15st February, 2020 add)Function &quot;base_convert(before, after, num)&quot; is used to convert the base of &lt;num&gt; from &lt;before&gt; to &lt;after&gt;.&lt;num&gt; must be a string.&lt;before&gt; and &lt;after&gt; must be bigger than 1 and smaller than 63.The order is 0-9,a-z,A-Z.If there’s a new version, the descriptions of the new functions will be add into the text.This project is created by a 12-year-old student.

	<longdescription>About=====**This is fork of original pydot (https://github.com/pydot/pydot) project which unfortunately has gone dead since late 2018. This fork simply merges all open PRs. The original pydot doesn't work on Windows 10 anymore with Python 3.7+. One of this PR solves this issue as well.**`pydot`:  - is an interface to [Graphviz][1]  - can parse and dump into the [DOT language][2] used by GraphViz,  - is written in pure Python,and [`networkx`][3] can convert its graphs to `pydot`.Development occurs at [GitHub][11] (under branch `dev`),where you can report issues and contribute code.Installation============From [PyPI][4] using [`pip`][5]:```pip install git+https://github.com/sytelus/pydot@v1.5.0#egg=pydot```From source:```pip install -e .```Note: If you had installed original pydot then first uninstall it using `pip uninstall pydot`.Dependencies============- [`pyparsing`][6]: used only for *loading* DOT files,  installed automatically during `pydot` installation.- GraphViz: used to render graphs as PDF, PNG, SVG, etc.  Should be installed separately, using your system's  [package manager][7], something similar (e.g., [MacPorts][8]),  or from [its source][9] or see [official binary downloads](https://www.graphviz.org/download/).License=======Distributed under an [MIT license][10].[1]: https://www.graphviz.org[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_%28graph_description_language%29[3]: https://github.com/networkx/networkx[4]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi[5]: https://github.com/pypa/pip[6]: https://github.com/pyparsing/pyparsing[7]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager[8]: https://www.macports.org[9]: https://github.com/ellson/graphviz[10]: https://github.com/pydot/pydot/blob/master/LICENSE[11]: https://github.com/pydot/pydot</longdescription>

	<longdescription># `mousse`: plagiarism detection using MOSS with post-processing`mousse` is a command-line tool to submit programming assignments to [MOSS](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/) plagiarism checker.Beyond submitting, it also performs the following: - download the report generated by MOSS - extract amounts of copied lines from it - compute distances between pairs of projects - generate heatmaps to visually identify clusters of similar projectsThe generated heatmaps are clickable, allowing one to directly look at MOSS report for a pair of projects.Before submission, code is cleaned a little bit to ease reading reports, in particular: - comments are removed - multiple files are grouped into a unique file`mousse` may also be used as a Python library to use its features separately.(By the way, _mousse_ if the French word for _moss_.)## InstallationRun `pip install pymousse`.`mousse` depends on: - Python 3 (developed with 3.9, may work with earlier versions) - [`requests`](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) - [`beautifulsoup4`](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) - [`chardet`](https://pypi.org/project/chardet/) - [`tqdm`](https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/) - [`mosspy`](https://pypi.org/project/mosspy/) - [`thefuzz`](https://pypi.org/project/thefuzz/) - [`python-Levenshtein`](https://pypi.org/project/python-Levenshtein/) - [`fastcluster`](https://pypi.org/project/fastcluster/) - [`pandas`](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) - [`numpy`](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/) - [`scipy`](https://pypi.org/project/scipy/) - [`seaborn`](https://pypi.org/project/seaborn/) - [`matplotlib`](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/)(By the way, _pymousse_ if pronounced in French as a famous brand of candies called _Pimousse_, and as name _mousse_ was already used on PyPi, it was natural to name the project like this.)## Using `mousse`### Overview`mousse` operates on a single directory `root` (specified on the command line) that should be organised as follows:```root/+- projects/|  +- student_1/|  +- student_2/|  +- ...+- base/```Directory `projects` (specified with option `-s`/`--source`) holds one directory for each student, where source code will be searched for to be sent to MOSS.Directory `base` (specified with `-b`/`--base`) is optional, and if used must contain the code that has been provided to students and will not be taken into account for plagiarism detection.Assuming current working directory is where `root` is located, `mousse` can by run as `python -m mousse -b base root`, or, if no `base` is provided, just as `python -m mousse root`.After running `mousse`, directory `root` has been populated with new content:```root/+- projects/  (untouched)+- base/      (untouched)+- moss/|  +- index.html|  +- match-0.html|  +- ...+- dists.csv+- dists.pdf+- dists-pruned.pdf```Directory `moss` is where MOSS report has been downloaded.File `dists.csv` is a CSV file with the distances computed from MOSS' matches: the more source code two projects have in common, the closer they are with respect to this distance.File `dists.pdf` is the heatmap computed to visually show the distances and cluster similar projects, and `dists-pruned.pdf` is a reduced version of the heatmap where only the most significant projects have been kept.A heatmap is a matrix showing the distance between every pairs of projects.It is clustered in such a way that close projects (ie, those that share more source code) are displayed next to each other, forming visual cluster of similar projects.Each pair of project is displayed as a square whose colour scales from red (very similar) to blue (very distinct).Each such square is clickable which allows to open directly the corresponding page in MOSS' report.Above the heatmap (and on its right), a dendogram is displayed to show how the clustering is organised, just like in [phylogenetic trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree).Note that the diagonal of such a heatmap is red by definition because it compares a project with itself.### Command line options`mousse` supports the following options: - `-u USERID`, `--userid USERID`   use `USERID` to authenticate with MOSS - `-c CONFIG`, `--config CONFIG`   path of configuration file (see below) - `-i`, `--incremental` (default: no)   do not submit source and dowload MOSS report is it exists - `-s SOURCE`, `--source SOURCE` (default: `projects`)   the directory within `root` where projects are located - `-b BASE`, `--base BASE` (default: none)   the directory within `root` where base source code is located - `-r REPORT`, `--report REPORT` (default: `moss`)   the directory where the downloaded MOSS report is saved - `-R`, `--raw`   use raw distances without cleaning (see below) - `-p PRUNE`, `--prune PRUNE` (default: 0.5)   how full heatmap is pruned (see below) - `-a`, `--absolute` (default: relative)   use absolute scale for heatmap coloring (see below) - `-l LANG`, `--lang LANG` (default: `c`)   programming language used for projects - `-L`, `--list-lang`   list supported programming languages and exitThen, except is `-L` was used, `mousse` expects then a path for `root`.Finally, any remaining option has to be formatted as `KEY=VALUE` and can be used to control heatmap rendering: - `lnk_OPT=VALUE`   `OPT=VALUE` is passed to `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage` when computing the clustering - `sns_OPT=VALUE`   `OPT=VALUE` is passed to `seaborn.clustermap` when drawing the heatmap - `plt_OPT=VALUE`   `OPT=VALUE` is passed to `matplotlib.pylab.savefig` when saving the heatmap### Configuration fileA configuration file `~/.config/mousse.ini` can be used to store MOSS user id, which avoids having to pass it with option `-u` every times:```[moss]userid = 123456789```Additionally, this file may contain definitions for new languages (or redefinition of existing languages), for instance C is defined as:```[lang:c]suffix = .csearch = *.c *.hcomment = [&quot;//&quot;, (&quot;/*&quot;, &quot;*/&quot;)]moss_lang = c```In this definition: - `lang:c` means we (re)define a language called `c` - `suffix` is the extension to use when creating a single file gathering all the source code from one project - `search` is the list of files patterns searched in a project directory, all other files will be ignored and not submitted to MOSS - `comment` is a Python list of either strings or pairs of strings that define the comments supported by the programming language.   A string defines a single-line comment starting with the given marker, a pair defines a single- or multi-line enclosed into the two given markers.   If the language has only single-line comments with just one marker, it may be given directly instead of a Python list, eg, for Python one may use `comment = #` - `moss_lang` is the language name as MOSS knows it### Cleaning and pruning heatmaps, absolute/relative colour scaleWhen distance between projects are computed from MOSS reports, a heuristic is used to filter matches that are not relevant.For each pair of projects `P1`, `P2`, and for each each match `M1`, `M2` (ie, two fragments of source code that MOSS reported as similar), a score is computed as: - the length of the match (maximum of the length of `M1` and `M2`) - divided by the [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) between `M1` and `M2` - multiplied by the number of lines copied between `P1` and `P2` as reported by MOSSIf all the matches for `P1`, `P2` score below the average, then this pair of project is assigned distance 1 (maximal distance).This result in practice in hiding pairs of projects with only irrelevant matches, that is, following how scores are computed, with: - short matches - with large edit distances - from projects with few similaritiesAs this is only a heuristic, it may be disabled using option `-R`, in which case the distance as directly computed from MOSS matches is used.Note that even if the heuristic is applied, the heatmap remains clickable and MOSS reports can be looked at, but the corresponding square is just drawn blue.Using option `-p PRUNE` allows one to control how the full heatmap can be pruned in order to keep only the pairs of most similar projects.First, `PRUNE &lt; 0` cancels pruning, only the full heatmap is computedThen, if `PRUNE &gt; 1`, at most `PRUNE` projects are kept, all the other are removed.This is performed by descending the dendogram on the heatmap progressively and removing isolated projects until we reach the expected count.Finally, if `0 &lt;= PRUNE &lt;= 1`, projects whose distance to any other is more than `MEAN - STDEV * PRUNE` are discarded, where `MEAN` is the average distance between every pair of projects and `STDEV` is the standard deviation.Heatmap are colored by default with a relative color scale, which means that the top of the dendogram is blue and the bottom red.When option `-a` is used, blue is for distance 1 and red is for 0, regardless of how the distances are actually distributed.Relative heatmaps exhibit more contrasted colours but tend to suggest closer proximity between projects.## API`mousse` may be used from Python programs.TODO: write some documentation, including docstrings</longdescription>

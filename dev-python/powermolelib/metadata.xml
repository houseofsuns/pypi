	<longdescription>===============powermole/lib===============This package contains building blocks to make an encrypted connection via one or more intermediate hosts possible.The underlying foundation is SSH with the ProxyJump directive enabled.This package also contains modules that provides a variety of services.For simplicity, all modules are designed in a functional manner.The power of SSH is harnessed by the *transferagent.py* and *tunnel.py* modules.These modules are responsible for copying the Agent (*agent.py*) to the destination host and setting up tunneling.Once tunneling is established, the Agent is executed by the Bootstrap Agent (*bootstrapagent.py*) by utilizing the stdin of Tunnel.The Instructor (*instructor.py*) is responsible for starting and stopping services provided by the Agent.These services includes: redirection of internet traffic (TOR mode), copying files (FILE option), and issuing commands (COMMAND option).For port forwarding (FOR mode), the program simply relies on SSH itself.The Instructor communicates with the Agent by sending JSON messages over the forwarded connection provided by Tunnel.The Agent also responds to heartbeats send by localhost to check if connection is still intact.Use the package **powermolecli** or **powermolegui** to interact with this library.How it works============Terminology-----------* **Tunnel** is an established connection from localhost to the target destination host through intermediate hosts (called gateways).* **Agent** is a python module running on the target destination host. It performs various functions.* **Instructor** sends instructions to the *Agent* by utilizing a forwarded connection provided by *Tunnel*.The program uses ssh to connect to the last host via one or more intermediaries... image:: ../img/illustration_how_it_works__1.pngThrough port forwarding, the program can communicate with the agent on the last host... image:: ../img/illustration_how_it_works__2.pngThe Instructor in conjunction with the Agent provides two modes:* TOR mode  * The target destination host acts as an exit node (in TOR terminology).* FOR(warding) mode  * Connections are forwarded to the target destination host.Regardless which mode is enabled, several options are presented when the tunnel is established:* COMMAND  * This option provides a rudimentary terminal interface to provide access to OS services on the target destination host.* TRANSFER  * This options allows selected files to be transferred to the target destination host.See `cli &lt;https://github.com/yutanicorp/powermolecli&gt;`_ or `gui &lt;https://github.com/yutanicorp/powermolegui&gt;`_ packages for implementation.Development Workflow====================The workflow supports the following steps * lint * test * build * document * upload * graphThese actions are supported out of the box by the corresponding scripts under _CI/scripts directory with sane defaults based on best practices.Sourcing setup_aliases.ps1 for windows powershell or setup_aliases.sh in bash on Mac or Linux will provide with handy aliases for the shell of all those commands prepended with an underscore.The bootstrap script creates a .venv directory inside the project directory hosting the virtual environment. It uses pipenv for that.It is called by all other scripts before they do anything. So one could simple start by calling _lint and that would set up everything before it tried to actually lint the projectOnce the code is ready to be delivered the _tag script should be called accepting one of three arguments, patch, minor, major following the semantic versioning scheme.So for the initial delivery one would call    $ _tag --minorwhich would bump the version of the project to 0.1.0 tag it in git and do a push and also ask for the change and automagically update HISTORY.rst with the version and the change provided.So the full workflow after git is initialized is: * repeat as necessary (of course it could be test - code - lint :) )   * code   * lint   * test * commit and push * develop more through the code-lint-test cycle * tag (with the appropriate argument) * build * upload (if you want to host your package in pypi) * document (of course this could be run at any point)Important Information=====================This template is based on pipenv. In order to be compatible with requirements.txt so the actual created package can be used by any part of the existing python ecosystem some hacks were needed.So when building a package out of this **do not** simple call    $ python setup.py sdist bdist_egg**as this will produce an unusable artifact with files missing.**Instead use the provided build and upload scripts that create all the necessary files in the artifact.Documentation=============* Documentation: https://powermolelib.readthedocs.org/en/latestContributing============Please read `CONTRIBUTING.md &lt;https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/b24679402957c63ec426&gt;`_ for details on our code of conduct, and the process for submitting pull requests to us.Authors=======* **Vincent Schouten** - *Initial work* - `LINK &lt;https://github.com/powermolelib&gt;`_See also the list of `contributors &lt;https://github.com/your/project/contributors&gt;`_ who participated in this project.License=======This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the `LICENSE.md &lt;LICENSE.md&gt;`_ file for detailsAcknowledgments===============* Costas Tyfoxylos* MisterDaneel (developer of pysoxy)History-------0.0.1 (13-05-2020)---------------------* First code creation0.1.0 (13-05-2020)------------------* First commit0.1.1 (13-05-2020)------------------* &lt;None&gt;0.1.2 (15-05-2020)------------------* Add debug mode, refactor logging1.0.0 (16-05-2020)------------------* Add parameter in tunnel.py to accept group of ports1.0.1 (16-05-2020)------------------* Add method to periodically purge buffer2.0.0 (16-05-2020)------------------* Refactor class responsible for instructing the Agent, refactor method responsible for transferring the Agent2.0.1 (04-07-2020)------------------* &lt;None&gt;2.1.0 (04-07-2020)------------------* Fix bug to make program work with 1 intermediary hosts2.2.0 (04-07-2020)------------------* Fix bug to make program work with &gt;1 intermediary hosts2.2.1 (31-10-2020)------------------* Fix bug to work with IPv6 addresses on macOS, add higher timeout for establishing SSH connections, bump dependency3.0.0 (26-03-2021)------------------* Add PLAIN mode, add COMMAND and TRANSFER options, add code to collect authenticated hosts3.0.1 (30-03-2021)------------------* Refactor method responsible for sending commands3.0.2 (11-04-2021)------------------* Refactor socket server and data protocol code, add new module3.1.0 (26-04-2021)------------------* Refactor bootstrapagent.py to make robust3.1.1 (17-05-2021)------------------* Refactor SOCKS code for readability3.1.2 (17-05-2021)------------------* Add support for Python interpreter &gt;3.73.2.0 (25-05-2021)------------------* Add parameter in transferagent.py, refactor and fix SOCKS code, refactor (API) parameters, add docstrings3.3.0 (01-06-2021)------------------* Add feature to set heartbeat interval, refactor SOCKS code3.3.1 (06-06-2021)------------------* Fix bug to avoid crashing when unable to connect, reword paragraph in README, reword commit messages in HISTORY.RST, reword list of keywords for PyPi3.3.2 (02-12-2021)------------------* Fix bug responsible for crashing powermole during transfer Agent3.4.0 (19-12-2021)------------------* Refactor heartbeat code and JSON validation schemas3.4.1 (19-12-2021)------------------* Fix error handling when sending of files fails3.4.2 (26-12-2021)------------------* Reword email address and fix sending files containing spaces3.4.3 (28-12-2022)------------------* Fix security vulnerability in 3rd party package3.4.4 (19-02-2023)------------------* Fix development workflow3.4.5 (30-03-2023)------------------* Fix security vulnerability, add Python version check3.4.6 (14-06-2023)------------------* Document paragraph about terminology</longdescription>

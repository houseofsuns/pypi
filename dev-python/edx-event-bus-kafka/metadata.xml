	<longdescription>edX Event Bus - Kafka#####################Kafka implementation for Open edX event bus.|pypi-badge| |ci-badge| |codecov-badge| |doc-badge| |pyversions-badge||license-badge|Overview********This package implements an event bus for Open edX using Kafka.The event bus acts as a broker between services publishing events and other services that consume these events.Implementing the event bus will allow for asynchronous messaging across services which greatly improves efficiency as we don't have to wait for scheduled batch synchronizations.Additionally, since the services all speak to the event bus, they are independent of one another and can still function if one service crashes.This package contains both the publishing code, which processes events into messages to send to the broker, and the consumer code,which polls the broker using a `while True` loop in order to turn messages back into event data to be emitted.The actual Kafka host will be configurable.The goal for event-bus-kafka is to eventually have a flexible event bus that can be easily brought into other apps and repositories to produce and consume arbitrary topics.Ideally, the event bus itself will also be an abstraction behind which platform maintainers can use non-Kafka implementations (Redis, Pulsar, etc.).The documentation/ADRs may also be moved to more appropriate places as the process matures.The repository works together with the openedx/openedx-events repository to make the fully functional event bus.Documentation*************To use this implementation of the Event Bus with openedx-events, you'll need to ensure that you include the dependency ``confluent_kafka[avro,schema-registry]`` (see `ADR 5 &lt;https://github.com/openedx/event-bus-kafka/blob/main/docs/decisions/0005-optional-import-of-confluent-kafka.rst&gt;`_ for an explanation) and set the following Django settings::    EVENT_BUS_KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS: ...    EVENT_BUS_KAFKA_SCHEMA_REGISTRY_URL: ...    EVENT_BUS_TOPIC_PREFIX: ...    # On the producing side:    EVENT_BUS_PRODUCER: edx_event_bus_kafka.create_producer    # On the consuming side:    EVENT_BUS_CONSUMER: edx_event_bus_kafka.KafkaEventConsumerOptional settings that are worth considering:- ``EVENT_BUS_KAFKA_CONSUMER_CONSECUTIVE_ERRORS_LIMIT``For manual testing, see `&lt;docs/how_tos/manual_testing.rst&gt;`__.Django management commands:- If you need to test event production, use the ``produce_event`` management command- To actually run the consumer, use openedx-events' ``consume_events`` management commandOEP-52 documentation: https://open-edx-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architectural-decisions/oep-0052-arch-event-bus-architecture.html(TODO: `Set up documentation &lt;https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/pages/21627535/Publish+Documentation+on+Read+the+Docs&gt;`_)Development Workflow********************One Time Setup==============.. code-block::  # Clone the repository  git clone git@github.com:openedx/event-bus-kafka.git  cd event-bus-kafka  # Set up a virtualenv using virtualenvwrapper with the same name as the repo and activate it  mkvirtualenv -p python3.8 event-bus-kafkaEvery time you develop something in this repo=============================================.. code-block::  # Activate the virtualenv  workon event-bus-kafka  # Grab the latest code  git checkout main  git pull  # Install/update the dev requirements  make requirements  # Run the tests and quality checks (to verify the status before you make any changes)  make validate  # Make a new branch for your changes  git checkout -b &lt;your_github_username&gt;/&lt;short_description&gt;  # Using your favorite editor, edit the code to make your change.  vim …  # Run your new tests  pytest ./path/to/new/tests  # Run all the tests and quality checks  make validate  # Commit all your changes  git commit …  git push  # Open a PR and ask for review.Installation************This library is not intended to be a direct dependency of any service. Instead, it will likely be installed by some private mechanism. Unless the platform gains new processes for installing private dependencies, upgrades will need to be manually managed via a pin.License*******The code in this repository is licensed under the AGPL 3.0 unlessotherwise noted.Please see `LICENSE.txt &lt;LICENSE.txt&gt;`_ for details.How To Contribute*****************Contributions are very welcome.Please read `How To Contribute &lt;https://github.com/openedx/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md&gt;`_ for details.The pull request description template should be automatically applied if you are creating a pull request from GitHub.

All enhancements and patches to edx_event_bus_kafka will be documented   in this file.  It adheres to the structure of https://keepachangelog.com/ ,   but in reStructuredText instead of Markdown (for ease of incorporation into   Sphinx documentation and the PyPI description).   This project adheres to Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)... There should always be an &quot;Unreleased&quot; section for changes pending release.Unreleased**********[5.1.0] - 2023-05-17********************Changed=======* Reconfigured serializers to use topic_record_name_strategy, allowing multiple event types per topic[5.0.0] - 2023-05-17********************Changed=======* **BREAKING CHANGE**: Removed deprecated ``signal`` argument from consumer initialization[4.0.1] - 2023-05-10********************Fixed=====* Added ``signal`` back as an argument when creating a consumer for compatibility with the openedx-events API[4.0.0] - 2023-05-10********************Changed=======* Implement openedx-events Event Bus Consumer API.* **BREAKING CHANGE**: Remove ``consume_events`` management command as this command will be provided by openedx_events.

New consumer groups will consume only messages that are sent after the group was initialized.* Remove redundant lookup of signal in consumer loop (should not have any effect)* Explicitly encode message header values as UTF-8 (no change in behavior)[1.3.0] - 2022-10-20********************Changed=======* Upgrade openedx-events. When AvroSignalSerializer gets event schemas, it will get whatever is currently defined in openedx-events, so this will update the COURSE_CATALOG_EVENT_CHANGED schema (dropping `effort` field)[1.2.0] - 2022-10-13********************Changed=======* ``EVENT_BUS_KAFKA_CONSUMERS_ENABLED`` now defaults to True instead of False* Removed manual monitoring since New Relic tracks these now.[1.1.0] - 2022-10-06********************Changed=======* Added monitoring for consumption tasks.[1.0.0] - 2022-10-03********************Changed=======* Fixed bug in schema registry that was sending schemas to the wrong topic* Bump version to 1.x to acknowledge that this is in use in production[0.7.0] - 2022-09-08********************Changed=======* **Breaking changes** ``EventProducerKafka`` is now ``KafkaEventProducer``* KafkaEventConsumer is now part of the public API[0.6.2] - 2022-09-08********************Added=====* Topic names can be autoprefixed by setting ``EVENT_BUS_TOPIC_PREFIX``[0.6.1] - 2022-09-06********************Added=====* Producer now polls on an interval, improving callback reliability.

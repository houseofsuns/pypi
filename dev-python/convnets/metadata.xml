	<longdescription># convnets🚧 Under constructionConvolutional Neural Networks and utilities for Computer Vision.- [Learn](learn) about convnets.- Learn about popular [models](models).## Models API`convnets` offers implementations for the following models:- [LeNet](http://vision.stanford.edu/cs598_spring07/papers/Lecun98.pdf)- [AlexNet](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf)- [VGG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556)- [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)To instantiate a model you need to import the corresponding class and pass a valid `configuration` object to the constructor:```pythonfrom convnets.models import ResNetr18_config = {'l': [{'r': 2, 'f': 64},{'r': 2, 'f': 128},{'r': 2, 'f': 256},{'r': 2, 'f': 512}], 'b': False}model = ResNet(r18_config)```Or you can use one of the predefined configurations, or variants:```pythonfrom convnets.models import ResNet, ResNetConfigmodel = ResNet(ResNetConfig.r18)```You can find the implementation of each model and configuration examples in the [`convnets/models`](convnets/models) directory.## Training APIIf you want to train a model in your notebooks, you can use our [fit](convents/train/fit.py) function:```pythonform convnets.train import fit hist = fit(model, dataloader, optimizer, criterion, metrics, max_epochs)```You can use any Pytorch model. You will need to define the Pytorch dataloader, optimizer and criterion. For the metrics, the function expects a dict with the name of the metric as key and the metric function as value. The metric function must receive the model output and the target and return a scalar value. You can find some examples in [`convnets/metrics`](convnets/metrics.py). The `max_epochs` parameter is the maximum number of epochs to train the model. The function will return a dict with the training history. Additionally, we offer a [training script](train/train.py) that you can execute from the command line.```bashpython scripts/train.py &lt;path_to_config_file&gt;```You will have to pass the path to a yaml file with the configuration for your training, including the model, optimizer, criterion, metrics, dataloader, etc. You can find some examples in the [`configs`](scripts/configs) directory (which are `timm` and `pytorch-lightning` compatible).We also offer Pytorch Lightning interoperability.</longdescription>

	<longdescription># 📺 Control Chromecasts from Linux`chromecast_mpris` is [a daemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)) utility that allows you to control media playback on casting devices from the Linux desktop. While this service runs, it gathers and  publishes data about the media and apps playing on your casting devices.**Note**: This package is now called Cast Control, and is [available on PyPI as `cast_control`](https://pypi.org/project/cast-control/). Please upgrade to `cast_control` for new features and bug fixes. ### Integrations`chromecast_mpris` controls Chromecasts and casting devices via D-Bus and [MPRIS media player controls](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/2.2/). MPRIS is the standard media player interface on Linux desktops. MPRIS integration is [enabled by default](https://github.com/KDE/plasma-workspace/tree/master/applets/mediacontroller) in Plasma Desktop, and, along with GNOME's volume control widget, [there are widgets for GNOME](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1379/mpris-indicator-button/), too. [`playerctl` provides a CLI](https://github.com/altdesktop/playerctl) for controlling media players through MPRIS.Check out [▶️mpris_server](https://github.com/alexdelorenzo/mpris_server) if you want to integrate MPRIS support into your media player.## ScreenshotsControlling a Chromecast via Plasma Desktop's Media Player widget:&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/alexdelorenzo/chromecast_mpris/raw/transition/chromecast_mpris/assets/mpris_widget.png&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/alexdelorenzo/chromecast_mpris/raw/transition/chromecast_mpris/assets/mpris_plasma.png&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; /&gt;## Features * [x] Control music and video playback * [x] Control app playback * [x] View playback information in real-time * [x] Display thumbnail and title * [x] Display playback position and media length * [x] Seek forward and backward * [x] Play, pause, and stop playback * [x] Volume up and down * [x] Play next and previous * [x] Quit casted app * [x] Open media from D-Bus * [x] Play YouTube videos * [ ] Playlist integration## Installation### Requirements - Linux / *BSD / [macOS](https://github.com/zbentley/dbus-osx-examples) - [D-Bus](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/) - Python &gt;= 3.6 - [PyGObject](https://pypi.org/project/PyGObject/) - `requirements.txt`#### Installing PyGObjectOn Debian-derived distributions like Ubuntu, install `python3-gi` with `apt`. On Arch, you'll want to install `python-gobject`, or install `chromecast_mpris` [directly from the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/chromecast_mpris/).On macOS, install [`pygobject3`](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/pygobject3) via `brew`.Use `pip` to install `PyGObject&gt;=3.34.0` if there are no installation candidates available in your vendor's package repositories.### PyPI```bash$ python3 -m pip install chromecast_mpris```You'll get a `chromecast_mpris` executable added to your `$PATH`.### GitHubCheck out [the releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/alexdelorenzo/chromecast_mpris/releases) for stable releases.If you'd like to use the development branch, clone the repository.Once you have a source copy, run `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`, followed by `python3 setup.py install`. You'll get a `chromecast_mpris` executable added to your `$PATH`.### AURIf you're on Arch, you can install `chromecast_mpris` [directly from the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/chromecast_mpris/).```bash$ yay -S chromecast_mpris```### UpgradesStable releases are uploaded to PyPI. You can upgrade your `chromecast_mpris` installation like so:```bash$ python3 -m pip --upgrade chromecast_mpris```See the [releases page](https://github.com/alexdelorenzo/chromecast_mpris/releases) on GitHub.## UsageYou'll need to make sure that your computer can make network connections with your casting devices. It also helps to know the names of the devices in advance.### LaunchInstalling the package via PyPI, GitHub or the AUR will add `chromecast_mpris` to your `pip` executables path:```bash$ which chromecast_mpris ~/.local/bin/chromecast_mpris```If you have your `pip` executables path added to your shell's `$PATH`, you can launch `chromecast_mpris` like so:```bash$ chromecast_mpris```You can also launch `chromecast_mpris` via its Python module. This can be useful if your `$PATH` doesn't point to your `pip` executables.```bash$ python3 -m chromecast_mpris```### Help#### Shell completionTo enable Bash completion for `chromecast_mpris`, add the following to your `~/.bashrc`:```basheval &quot;$(_CHROMECAST_MPRIS_COMPLETE=bash_source chromecast_mpris)&quot;```For the `zsh` and `fish` shells, check out [the documentation here](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.0.x/shell-completion/#enabling-completion).#### Help command```bash$ chromecast_mpris --helpUsage: chromecast_mpris [OPTIONS]  Control casting devices via Linux media controls and desktops.  This daemon connects your casting device directly to the D-Bus media  player interface.Options:  -n, --name TEXT         Connect to a device via its name, otherwise control                          the first device found.  -h, --host TEXT         Connect to a device via its hostname or IP address,                          otherwise control the first device found.  -u, --uuid TEXT         Connect to a device via its UUID, otherwise control                          the first device found  -w, --wait FLOAT        Seconds to wait between trying to make initial                          successful connections to a device.  -r, --retry-wait FLOAT  Seconds to wait between reconnection attempts if a                          successful connection is interrupted.  [default:                          5.0]  -i, --icon              Use a lighter icon instead of the dark icon. The                          lighter icon goes well with dark themes.  [default:                          False]  -l, --log-level TEXT    Set the debugging log level.  [default: WARN]  --help                  Show this message and exit.```### Connect to a deviceConnect to a device named &quot;My Device&quot; and run `chromecast_mpris` in the background.```bash$ chromecast_mpris --name &quot;My Device&quot; &amp;[1] 1234```After launching `chromecast_mpris`, you can use any MPRIS client to interact with it. MPRIS support is built in directly to Plasma Desktop and GNOME 3, and you can use `playerctl` on the command-line. ### Retry until a Chromecast is foundYou can use the `-w/--wait` flag to specify a waiting period in seconds before `chromecast_mpris` will try to find a casting device again if one is not found initially.For example, if you want to wait 60 seconds between scans for devices, you can run the following:```bash$ export SECONDS=60$ chromecast_mpris --wait $SECONDS```This is useful if you'd like to start `chromecast_mpris` at login, and there is a chance that your device isn't on, or you're on a different network. ### Open a URI on a Chromecast Get the D-Bus name for your device using `playerctl`.```bash$ playerctl --list-allMy_Device```Use the D-Bus name to issue commands to it.```bash$ export URL=&quot;http://ccmixter.org/content/gmz/gmz_-_Parametaphoriquement.mp3&quot;$ playerctl --player My_Device open &quot;$URL&quot;```This will play a song on your device.### Open a YouTube videoYou can cast YouTube videos the same way you can cast a generic URI.```bash$ export VIDEO=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4nkgJdVZFA&quot;$ playerctl --player My_Device open &quot;$VIDEO&quot;```## SupportWant to support this project and [other open-source projects](https://github.com/alexdelorenzo) like it?&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buymeacoffee.com/alexdelorenzo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-blue.png&quot; alt=&quot;Buy Me A Coffee&quot; height=&quot;60px&quot; style=&quot;height: 60px !important;width: 217px !important;max-width:25%&quot; &gt;&lt;/a&gt;## LicenseSee `LICENSE`.

The following options are supported:```yaml---database: mysql+pymysql://userName:passWord@domain.com/databaseroot: /path/to/root/dir```The `root` option is used to store files within the Housekeeper context.#### Command: `init`Setup (or reset) the database. It will simply setup all the tables in the database. You can reset an existing database by using the `--reset` option.```bashhousekeeper --database &quot;sqlite:///hk.sqlite3&quot; initSuccess! New tables: bundle, file, file_tag_link, tag, version```#### Command: `include`Include (hard-link) all files of an existing bundle version into Housekeeper and the `root` path.```bashhousekeeper myBundle```This will only work if the bundle only has a single version which can be &quot;imported&quot;. If you want to import a specific version of a bundle you can use the `--version` option.#### Command: `delete files`Delete files that are not on disk anymore like his:`housekeeper delete files --tag fastq --notondisk`Remove all bam files before a certain date:`housekeeper delete files --tag bam --before 2017-06-15`Remove fastq files from a flowcell:`housekeeper delete files --tag fastq --tag H0HKKALXX`It'll always ask for confirmation, unless you add --yes:`housekeeper delete files --bundle sillyfish --yes`If you do not provide a --tag or --bundle, essentially deleting everything, the function will not let you do that.[pypi]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/housekeeper/[coveralls-url]: https://coveralls.io/r/Clinical-Genomics/housekeeper[coveralls-image]: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/Clinical-Genomics/housekeeper.svg?style=flat-square[github-url]: https://github.com/Clinical-Genomics/housekeeper/workflows/Housekeeper%20tests/badge.svg[development manual]: http://www.clinicalgenomics.se/development/dev/githubflow/[codefactor-image]: https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/clinical-genomics/housekeeper/badge[codefactor-url]: https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/clinical-genomics/housekeeper[black-image]: https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg[black-url]: https://github.com/psf/black</longdescription>

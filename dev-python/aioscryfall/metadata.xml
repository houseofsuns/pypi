	<longdescription>aioscryfall - Asynchronous Python client for Scryfall API=========================================================aioscryfall is a Python client for the Scryfall API. It is primarily designed for asynchronous use with asyncio, but a synchronous client is also provided.The development is essentially feature complete but the documentation is largely absent, at present. (I need to remind myself how mkdocs works and figure out what I want to say)As of right now, Python 3.11 is required because I wanted to use a number of typing features that were added in 3.11. I may change this in the future, but it is a lower priority than getting the API to a point where I am happy with it.Everything is extensively typed and I have tried to make the API as intuitive as possible. I have also tried to make the API as close to the Scryfall API as possible, but I have made some changes to make it more Pythonic (namely converting paginated lists into iterable generators).A minimal use case to get yourself started:.. code:: python    import asyncio    import aiohttp    from aioscryfall.api.cards import UniqueMode    from aioscryfall.client import ScryfallClient    async def get_bolt():        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:            client = ScryfallClient(session)            bolts = [c async for c in client.cards.search(&quot;lightning bolt&quot;, unique=UniqueMode.PRINTS)]            return bolts    bolts = asyncio.run(get_bolt())    print(len(bolts), bolts[0])Or if you prefer not to use async:.. code:: python    from aioscryfall.api.cards import UniqueMode    from aioscryfall.sync.client import ScryfallSyncClient    client = ScryfallSyncClient()    bolts = list(client.cards.search(&quot;lightning bolt&quot;, unique=UniqueMode.PRINTS))    print(len(bolts), bolts[0])</longdescription>

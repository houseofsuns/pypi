	<longdescription># V7 Darwin Python SDKOfficial library to manage datasets along with[V7 Darwin annotation platform](https://darwin.v7labs.com).Darwin-py can both be used from the [command line](#usage-as-a-command-line-interface-cli) and as a [python library](#usage-as-a-python-library).Main functions are (but not limited to):- Client authentication- Listing local and remote datasets- Create/remove datasets- Upload/download data to/from remote datasets- Direct integration with PyTorch dataloadersSupport tested for python 3.8.## Installation```pip install darwin-py```You can now type `darwin` in your terminal and access the command line interface.If you wish to use the PyTorch bindings, then you can use the `ml` flag to install all the additional requirements```pip install darwin-py[ml]```To run test, first install the `test` extra package```pip install darwin-py[test]```---## Usage as a Command Line Interface (CLI)Once installed, `darwin` is accessible as a command line tool.A useful way to navigate the CLI usage is through the help command `-h/--help` which willprovide additional information for each command available.### Client AuthenticationTo perform remote operations on Darwin you first need to authenticate.This requires a [team-specific API-key](https://darwin.v7labs.com/?settings=api-keys).If you do not already have a Darwin account, you can [contact us](https://www.v7labs.com/contact) and we can set one up for you.To start the authentication process:```$ darwin authenticateAPI key:Make example-team the default team? [y/N] yDatasets directory [~/.darwin/datasets]:Authentication succeeded.```You will be then prompted to enter your API-key, whether you want to set the corresponding team asdefault and finally the desired location on the local file system for the datasets of that team.This process will create a configuration file at `~/.darwin/config.yaml`.This file will be updated with future authentications for different teams.### Listing local and remote datasetsLists a summary of local existing datasets```$ darwin dataset localNAME            IMAGES     SYNC_DATE         SIZEmydataset       112025     yesterday     159.2 GB```Lists a summary of remote datasets accessible by the current user.```$ darwin dataset remoteNAME                       IMAGES     PROGRESSexample-team/mydataset     112025        73.0%```### Create/remove a datasetTo create an empty dataset remotely:```$ darwin dataset create testDataset 'test' (example-team/test) has been created.Access at https://darwin.v7labs.com/datasets/579```The dataset will be created in the team you're authenticated for.To delete the project on the server:```$ darwin dataset remove testAbout to delete example-team/test on darwin.Do you want to continue? [y/N] y```### Upload/download data to/from a remote datasetUploads data to an existing remote project.It takes the dataset name and a single image (or directory) with images/videos to upload asparameters.The `-e/--exclude` argument allows to indicate file extension/s to be ignored from the data_dir.e.g.: `-e .jpg`For videos, the frame rate extraction rate can be specified by adding `--fps &lt;frame_rate&gt;`Supported extensions:- Video files: [`.mp4`, `.bpm`, `.mov` formats].- Image files [`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png` formats].```$ darwin dataset push test /path/to/folder/with/images100%|████████████████████████| 2/2 [00:01&lt;00:00,  1.27it/s]```Before a dataset can be downloaded, a release needs to be generated:```$ darwin dataset export test 0.1Dataset test successfully exported to example-team/test:0.1```This version is immutable, if new images / annotations have been added you will have to create a new release to included them.To list all available releases```$ darwin dataset releases testNAME                           IMAGES     CLASSES                   EXPORT_DATEexample-team/test:0.1               4           0     2019-12-07 11:37:35+00:00```And to finally download a release.```$ darwin dataset pull test:0.1Dataset example-team/test:0.1 downloaded at /directory/choosen/at/authentication/time.```---## Usage as a Python libraryThe framework is designed to be usable as a standalone python library.Usage can be inferred from looking at the operations performed in `darwin/cli_functions.py`.A minimal example to download a dataset is provided below and a more extensive one can be found in[darwin_demo.py](./darwin_demo.py).```pythonfrom darwin.client import Clientclient = Client.local() # use the configuration in ~/.darwin/config.yamldataset = client.get_remote_dataset(&quot;example-team/test&quot;)dataset.pull() # downloads annotations and images for the latest exported version```Follow [this guide](https://docs.v7labs.com/docs/loading-a-dataset-in-python) for how to integrate darwin datasets directly in PyTorch.</longdescription>

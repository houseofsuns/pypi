	<longdescription>Python unittest test suite for Robot Framework==============================================This is an experimental packagefor wrapping Robot Framework test suites into Python unittest suitesto make it possible to run Robot Framework testsas `plone.testing`_'s layered test suites:.. code:: python    import unittest    from plone.testing import layered    from robotsuite import RobotTestSuite    from my_package.testing import ACCEPTANCE_TESTING    def test_suite():        suite = unittest.TestSuite()        suite.addTests([            layered(RobotTestSuite('mysuite.txt'),                    layer=ACCEPTANCE_TESTING),        ])        return suite*RobotTestSuite* splits Robot Framework test suites into separateunittest test cases so that Robot will be run once for every testcase in every test suite parsed from the given Robot Frameworktest suite.Because of that, each Robot will generate a separate test reportfor each test.Each report will have it's own folder,which are created recursivelyreflecting the structure of the given test suite.*RobotTestSuite*'s way of wrapping tests intounittest's test suite is similar to how doctest-module'sDocTestSuite does its wrappings.See the documentation of DocTestSuite forpossible common parameters (e.g. for how to pass a test suite from adifferent package).The main motivation behind this package is to makeRobot Framework support existing test fixtures and test isolationwhen testing `Plone`_.Yet, this should help anyone wanting to use Robot Framework with`zope.testrunner`_ or other Python unittest compatible test runner... _plone.testing: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.testing.. _zope.testrunner: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zope.testrunner.. _Plone: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PloneIf this works for you, please contribute at:http://github.com/collective/robotsuite/.. image:: https://github.com/collective/robotsuite/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=master   :target: https://github.com/collective/robotsuite/actionsSetting robot variables from environment variables--------------------------------------------------Robot Framework supports overriding test variables from command-line, whichis not-available when running tests as robotsuite-wrapped with other testrunners. That's why robotsuite supports settings variables as environmentvariables so that every ``ROBOT_``-prefixed environment variable will bemapped into corresponding test variable without the ``ROBOT_``-prefix.Declaring tests non-critical by given set of tags-------------------------------------------------.. note:: Criticality is no-longer supported in Robot Framework &gt;= 4.0 and has been   replaced with SKIP status. Robotsuite does not take a stance on SKIP status yet.Robot Framework supports declaring tests with given tags as *non-critical*to prevent their failing to fail the complete build on CI. This is supportedas keyword argument for *RobotTestSuite* as follows:.. code:: python   def test_suite():       suite = unittest.TestSuite()       suite.addTests([           layered(RobotTestSuite('mysuite.txt',                                  noncritical=['non-critical-tag']),                   layer=ACCEPTANCE_TESTING),       ])       return suiteSetting zope.testrunner-level-----------------------------`zope.testrunner`_ supports annotating test suites with levels to avoidslow test being run unless wanted:.. code:: python   def test_suite():       suite = unittest.TestSuite()       suite.addTests([           layered(RobotTestSuite('mysuite.txt'),                   layer=ACCEPTANCE_TESTING),       ])       suite.level = 10       return suiteRetry failing tests-------------------You can retry a failed test.This can be useful for flaky robot browser tests.Warning: this may not be good for all types of test.For example any changes that were done in the test until the first failure, may persist.You can enable retries in two ways:- Set an environment variable ``ROBOTSUITE_RETRY_COUNT=X``.- Override this by passing ``retry_count=X`` to a ``RobotTestSuite`` call.The default is zero: no retries.The retry count *excludes* the original try... code:: python    def test_suite():        suite = unittest.TestSuite()        suite.addTests([            robotsuite.RobotTestSuite('test_example.robot', retry_count=3),            robotsuite.RobotTestSuite('test_variables.robot'),            robotsuite.RobotTestSuite('test_setups', retry_count=2)        ])        return suiteAppending test results to existing test report----------------------------------------------When running Robot Framework through robotsuite, its test reports are createdinto the current working directory with filenames ``robot_output.xml``,``robot_log.html`` and ``robot_report.html``. The default behavior is tooverride the existing ``robot_output.xml`` (and also the other report filesgenerated from that).To merge test results from separate test runs into the same test report, setenvironment variable ``ROBOTSUITE_APPEND_OUTPUT_XML=1`` to prevent robotsuitefrom overriding the existing test results, but to always append to the existing``robot_output.xml``.Filtering test execution errors-------------------------------Set environment variable ``ROBOTSUITE_LOGLEVEL=ERROR`` to filter all top level*Test Execution Errors* below the given log level (e.g. ERROR) from the mergedtest report. This is useful when unnecessary warnings are leaking from thetested code into Robot Framework logs.Including or skipping all RobotTestSuite-wrapped tests------------------------------------------------------Robot Framework is often used with Selenium2Library_ to write acceptance testusing the Selenium-framework. Yet, because those test may be slow to run, onemight want sometimes (e.g. on CI) to run everything except the robotsuitewrapped tests, and later only the robotsuite wrapped tests.This can be achieved for sure, with injecting a custom string into the namesof robotsuite-wrapped tests with ``ROBOTSUITE_PREFIX``-environment variableand then filter the test with that string.E.g. run everything except the robotsuite wrapped tests with:.. code:: bash   $ ROBOTSUITE_PREFIX=ROBOTSUITE bin/test --all -t \!ROBOTSUITEand the other way around with:.. code:: bash   $ ROBOTSUITE_PREFIX=ROBOTSUITE bin/test --all -t ROBOTSUITE.. _Selenium2Library: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/robotframework-selenium2libraryRe-using test suites from other packages----------------------------------------Sometime it could be useful to re-use acceptance test from some upstreampackage to test your slightly tailored package (e.g. with a custom theme).This can be done with by defining the test lookup location with``package``-keyword argment for ``RobotTestSuite``:.. code:: python    def test_suite():        suite = unittest.TestSuite()        suite.addTests([            layered(leveled(                robotsuite.RobotTestSuite('robot',                                          package='Products.CMFPlone.tests'),            ), layer=PLONE_APP_MOSAIC_NO_PAC_ROBOT),        ])        return suiteChangelog=========2.3.1 (2022-05-23)------------------- Let tests be critical by default.

The idea is that we can centralize thedesign and maintenance of &quot;meta&quot; project code (such as CI testinginfrastructure) in this project, rather than each repository maintaining thatcode independently.The basic methodology for this project is a templating system in whichthere are common templates for meta files that are populated withdata in each downstream project.  Projects control this templating through the``.nengobones.yml`` configuration file, which defines the information used tofill in the templates.Wherever possible, we try to do this templating in such a way that downstreamprojects will be automatically updated when an update is made in``nengo-bones``. However, some files cannot be updated automatically andrequire downstream repos to manually run a script to update those files.Note that this repository itself is configured using the ``nengo-bones``templating system, so if you would like an example of how to use it, check out`the source code &lt;https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones&gt;`__.Installation============NengoBones is designed to be used based on the ``master`` branch (although werelease occasional stable checkpoints to PyPI). This can be installed via.. code-block:: bash    git clone https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones.git    pip install -e ./nengo-bonesBasic usage===========The first step is to fill in the ``.nengobones.yml`` configuration file.  Youcan use the one in this repository as a starting point, or see`the documentation&lt;https://www.nengo.ai/nengo-bones/examples/configuration.html&gt;`__for more details.  This file should beplaced in the top level of your project.All of the manually generated template files can then be rendered by runningthis command in the same folder as the ``.nengobones.yml`` file:.. code-block:: bash    bones generateSee ``bones generate --help`` or`the documentation &lt;https://www.nengo.ai/nengo-bones/cli.html&gt;`__for a full list of command line options.Documentation=============- `Command line usage &lt;https://www.nengo.ai/nengo-bones/cli.html&gt;`_- `Demonstration of available configuration options  &lt;https://www.nengo.ai/nengo-bones/examples/configuration.html&gt;`_- `API reference &lt;https://www.nengo.ai/nengo-bones/reference.html&gt;`_***************Release History***************.. Changelog entries should follow this format:   version (release date)   ======================   **section**   - One-line description of change (link to Github issue/PR).. Changes should be organized in one of several sections:   - Added   - Changed   - Deprecated   - Removed   - Fixed22.11.15 (November 15, 2022)============================**Added**- Added support for new ``one_page`` option in ``nengo-sphinx-theme``. (`#101`_)- Added the ``bones-format-notebook`` script to apply automated formatting, cleanup,  and static checking to Jupyter notebooks. (`#32`_)- Static script will now check that ``bones-format-notebook`` has been applied to all  notebooks in the ``docs`` directory. (`#32`_)- Added ``remote-script.sh`` CI script for running other CI scripts on a remote device.  (`#124`_)- Added `isort &lt;https://pycqa.github.io/isort/&gt;`_ configuration to  ``pyproject.toml`` and check import order during static checks. (`#121`_)- Officially support and test against Python 3.9. (`#136`_)- Added ``skip`` option to codespell config, which can be used to specify files that  should be ignored. (`#138`_)- Added support for projects with type hints through the ``py_typed`` section. (`#140`_)- Added ``min_python`` option to the main section. The default ``python_requires``  in ``setup.py`` is now based on this, if not overridden. (`#140`_)- Added support for changing the main branch name with the ``main_branch``  config option. (`#145`_)- Added template for ``version.py``. (`#151`_)- Added ``apache`` license type. (`#160`_)- Added ``proprietary`` license type. (`#162`_)- Added several actions for use with Github Actions:  ``setup`` initializes  a python environment,  ``generate-and-check`` runs ``bones-generate`` and ``bones-check``,  ``run-script`` runs a CI script such as ``static.sh``, and  ``coverage-report`` generates combined coverage reports. (`#166`_)- Added support for ``docformatter`` (and static checks will now enforce that  docformatter has been applied). (`#168`_)- Added support for building and releasing Python projects through the  ``deploy`` CI script. (`#172`_)- Added a ``bones check-deploy`` script that checks several items that we  depend on for releases. (`#172`_)**Changed**- Restrict pylint version to &lt;2.5 due to issue when the package being checked  is not installed in the current environment. (`#103`_)- Increased minimum ``pylint`` version to 2.5.1 (`#32`_)- Documentation ``[source]`` links now point to GitHub. (`#117`_)- Separate tokens, ``PYPI_TOKEN`` and ``PYPI_TEST_TOKEN``, must now be specified  for deploying to PyPI and TestPyPI, respectively. (`#127`_)- Builds for this repository now run on TravisCI.com instead of TravisCI.org. (`#130`_)- Drop support for Python 3.5. (`#123`_)- Doc script will now install Sphinx&gt;=3.1.2. (`#137`_)- Codespell ignore words is now specified via the ``codespell.ignore_words`` section  of ``setup_cfg`` (instead of in the static CI script config). As a result, it will  now apply to all invocations of codespell (not just from the static script). (`#138`_)- ``bones-format-notebook --check`` will now require that all ``codespell`` checks pass.  (`#138`_)- Switched to new version of Codecov uploader and added checksum verification. (`#150`_)- Increased minimum ``black`` version to 21.12b0. (`#104`_, `#159`_)- License fields in ``setup.py`` are now set using ``license_rst.type``. (`#161`_)- Trove classifiers in ``setup.py`` are now sorted alphabetically. (`#161`_)- Updated Nengo license and renamed to ABR license. (`#157`_)- The license type is now specified through a ``license`` key at the top level.  If not specified, it defaults to ``proprietary``. (`#157`_)- All CI scripts now support running either through Github Actions or TravisCI.  (`#166`_)- Added additional config options to mypy ``setup.cfg`` template. (`#170`_)- Restrict setuptools version to &lt;64 (fixes issues with various code inspection tools  like mypy, pylint, IDE integrations). (`#173`_)- Removed the ``deploy_dists`` configuration option for the ``deploy`` script,  and replaced it with a boolean ``wheel`` option. (`#172`_)- Consolidated all scripts under a single ``bones`` command. Subcommands have the  same names as before, without the ``bones-`` prefix (e.g., ``bones-generate``  is now ``bones generate``). (`#172`_)**Removed**- Removed ``before_script``, ``before_cache``, ``before_deploy``, and ``after_deploy``  steps from CI scripts (they weren't actually used anywhere). (`#166`_)- Removed ``analytics_id`` option for ``docs/conf.py``. Create a custom ``docs/conf.py``  template and override the ``analytics`` block if you need to customize analytics  tracking. (`#169`_)- Removed support for TravisCI in CI scripts. All downstream repositories should  switch to use Github Actions. (`#172`_)**Fixed**- Intermittent failures installing miniconda in the remote script have been fixed by  retrying the miniconda install if it fails. (`#130`_)- Fixed an issue in which Codecov would not report on files where a file in a  deeper folder shares the same name. (`#132`_)- Fixed an issue in which CI scripts did not have access to the same configuration  options as other templates. (`#144`_)- Removed pylint disable for ``bad-continuation`` as it no longer exists. (`#163`_)- Removed pylint disable for ``no-self-use`` as it is now optional. (`#163`_)- Static checks will not try to check ``docs`` directory if it doesn't exist. (`#165`_)- Static checks will no longer assume that CI scripts are in a folder named ``.ci``  (it will look for any scripts in the same folder as the static script). (`#166`_)- Black will now ignore excluded files even if that filename is passed directly  to black (e.g. when running through a precommit hook or IDE plugin). (`#161`_)- Only delete remote build directories more than a day old.

(`#98`_)- Rendered documentation will not be uploaded on cron builds. (`#98`_)- Docs script will now clean up the built doc directory before execution, if it exists  (e.g., because the docs job is being rerun).

(`#52`_)- Added ``rng_salt`` option to the ``pytest`` section of the ``setup.cfg``  template to set the salt for pytest-rng. (`#55`_).. _#52: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/52.. _#55: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/550.4.1 (July 26, 2019)=====================**Added**- Added ``allclose_tolerances`` option to the ``pytest`` section of the  ``setup.cfg`` template to set tolerances for pytest-allclose.

(`#44`_)- Added templates for ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` and ``pyproject.toml``  so downstream repositories can easily adopt Black. (`#49`_)**Changed**- We now check that Python source files are autoformatted with Black  in the ``static.sh`` script. (`#49`_)- Templates will now be autoformatted with Black during the rendering  process, if Black is installed. (`#49`_)- Take advantage of multiprocessing to speed up pylint static checks. (`#49`_)- The ``E203`` flake8 check and ``bad-continuation`` pylint check are now  disabled by default. (`#50`_).. _#44: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/44.. _#49: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/49.. _#50: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/500.3.0 (July 19, 2019)=====================**Added**- The ``nengo_bones.templates`` module was added to consolidate code  that loads and renders templates. (`#45`_)**Changed**- The ``docs/conf.py`` template has been updated for new versions of  Nengo Sphinx Theme. (`#46`_)- ``static.sh`` and ``examples.sh`` will now check any notebooks in the  ``docs`` folder (not just ``docs/examples``). (`#46`_)- ``bones-check`` now checks that the content of the generated files  matches the expected content, rather than relying on version numbers.  This means most files will not need to be regenerated when new NengoBones  versions are released, and that ``bones-check`` will be sensitive to changes  within a dev version. (`#45`_)**Fixed**- The ``static.sh``/``examples.sh`` script will no longer fail if there are no  notebooks in the ``docs`` folder. (`#46`_).. _#45: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/45.. _#46: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/460.2.1 (May 24, 2019)====================**Added**- Added ``codespell_ignore_words`` option to ``static.sh.template``,  which is a list of words that ``codespell`` will ignore. (`#35`_)- Added ``analytics_id`` option to ``docs_conf.py.template``,  which will enable Google Analytics tracking. (`#35`_)**Changed**- ``codespell`` will now ignore ``_vendor`` directories. (`#36`_)**Fixed**- Fixed an issue with ``static.sh.template`` in which Python files  that were not converted from notebooks were deleted. (`#16`_).. _#16: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/16.. _#35: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/35.. _#36: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/360.2.0 (May 15, 2019)====================**Added**- Added ``apt_install`` option that can be set in the ``jobs`` section to  ``apt install`` any custom ``apt`` requirements for a job. (`#14`_)- Added templates for ``CONTRIBUTING.rst``, ``CONTRIBUTORS.rst``,  ``LICENSE.rst``, ``MANIFEST.in``, ``docs/conf.py``, ``setup.cfg``, and  ``setup.py`` (`#17`_)- Templates will now be automatically loaded from a ``&lt;repo&gt;/.templates``  directory if it exists. When overriding existing templates, the built-in  templates can be accessed in ``include`` and ``extend`` tags with the  ``templates/`` prefix. (`#17`_)- Added ``flake8`` to the static check script. (`#17`_)- Added the ``bones-pr-number`` script to predict the next PR number for a  repository. This helps when writing a changelog entry before a PR has been  made. (`#18`_)**Changed**- The Python version is now specified by the ``python`` option (instead of  ``python_version``), for consistency with ``.travis.yml``. (`#14`_)- All ``nengo-bones`` scripts now start with ``bones-``, to make them easier  to find with autocompletion. ``generate-bones`` is now ``bones-generate``,  and ``check-bones`` is now ``bones-check``. (`#18`_)**Removed**- Removed ``conda`` from the CI setup; all installations should be done  through ``pip`` instead. (`#14`_)- Removed the ``--template-dir`` option from the ``generate-bones`` script;  use a ``.templates`` directory instead. (`#17`_)**Fixed**- Order of templated dicts should now be deterministic for  all Python versions. (`#14`_).. _#14: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/14.. _#17: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/17.. _#18: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/180.1.0 (April 15, 2019)======================Initial release of NengoBones!Thanks to all of the contributors for making this possible!</longdescription>

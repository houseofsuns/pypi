	<longdescription># atomprobe-data-modeling## Mission:Foster exchange about data models and work towards specificationsof file formats from the research field of atom probe microscopy.# Getting startedYou should create a virtual environment. We tested on Ubuntu with Python 3.8.Newer versions of Python should work similarly when using the desired version tag.If you don't have Python 3.8 installed on your computer, follow these commands:```sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppasudo apt install python3.8 python3-dev libpython3.8-dev python3.8-venv```In some cases when using Python3.8, it was necessary to install python-numpy.Please consider this if you run into issues when continuing with this manual.The following steps will install the ifes_apt_tc_data_modeling module in thelatest version.```mkdir &lt;your-brand-new-folder&gt;cd &lt;your-brand-new-folder&gt;pip install virtualenvvirtualenv --python=python3.8 .py38source .py38/bin/activategit clone git@github.com:atomprobe-tc/ifes_apt_tc_data_modeling.gitcd ifes_apt_tc_data_modelingpython -m pip install --upgrade pippython -m pip install pip-toolspython -m pip install -e .python -m pip list```## Additional steps to do when working with jupyter notebooksBy default the functionalities are offered as a library for Python programmers.For developers and users who would like to try using the library a convenientway is via jupyter notebooks. You can find instructions about how to use this toolin the tests/data jupyter notebook. This notebook can be started from the commandline inside the ifes_apt_tc_data_modeling directory simply by calling.If you would like to use a jupyter notebook jupyter has to be installed asit will not be installed by default. To achieve this perform the following actions:```python -m pip install -e &quot;.[dev]&quot;python -m pip listjupyter-lab```## Documentation of file formats and data models in atom probe status quoDetailed technical specifications of the file formats and data models are not available formost formats in the field of atom probe microscopy. A practical solution to address this limitation has been so far that scientists collect example files formatted in respective formats.These so-called instances were inspected and shared with colleagues. In summary, individualatom probers have contributed to formulate what can be considered likely candidatesof specifications for several file formats via reverse engineering.This worked especially well for the POS and ePOS formats.Pieces of information about file formats were reported in the literature (e.g.the books by D. Larson et al. and B. Gault et al.). Atom probers like D. Haley have contributedsubstantially to make the community aware of existent limitations and these reverse engineeringpractices. AMETEK/Cameca is the key technology partner in atom probe. They have developedan open file format called APT which improves the accessibility of specific numerical data andsome metadata. Individuals like M. Kühbach have driven the implementation and communication ofparsers for this APT file format.Nowadays there is an increased interest and demand placed on atom probers by the funding agenciesthat researchers should or even have to make their research data management and data stewardshipbetter matching and more completely aligned to the aims and practices of the F.A.I.R.principles of data stewardship. Therefore, it is useful to exchange more details aboutdata models and file formats. Otherwise, it is not foreseeable how atom probe data can be madereally interoperable with electronic lab notebooks, research data managementsystems (RDMS), and related software tools for data analyses.In light of these challenges, the idea of understanding formats just by examples, showed to be aslow and error-prone route as e.g. source code and workflows which have been useed to write suchfiles, and the associated input, workflow, and provenance information has typically not been captured.Or the specific software tool(s) used might not have been shared or made accessible for reviewby the atom probe community.## Benefit and Next StepsYou can easily imagine that the more people will support this work the more complete a publicunderstanding and knowledge about the available file formats in atom probe microscopy will become.This can help all of us in the long run to build software tools which are more reliable, yieldthrustworthy results and are technically more robust when it comes to parsing research data.Irrespective from which tools these data and metadata come or how one would like to used these data.The Python parsers in this repository are meant as a motivation to offer immediate benefit for users.The collection of examples and technical discussions via issues serves the more long-term aim.This is to arrive at a detailed technical specification rather than having more robust parsers onlyso that atom probe data can be exchanged across tools irrespective of their formatting.## Support us with this workThank you very much for supporting this activity and your time.## Feedback, questionsFeel free to drop us a message via creating an issue or commenting on one.Feel invited to use the resources in this repository.## Where to place your examples?There is a *examples_with_provenance* and *examples_without_provenance*sub-directory for each file format.When you do know with which software and measured dataset you have created a file,you should share the file and these pieces of information (software version). Do so bynaming at least the respective raw files. Ideally, you share the examples via offeringa link to an external data repository such as Zenodo or other providers. This not onlyavoids that this repository would get too much filled up with binary data.Also it enables you to share clearly under which license you would like make yourexample(s) accessible.## Provenance if possible, plain examples if in doubtUse the *examples_with_provenance* sub-directory. With this it is at least possibleto reproduce the file creation. A practical solution is to share (by uploading)the screenshot of the complete IVAS/APSuite version info screen, includingthe APSuite version, the CERN Root version, the CamecaRoot version, and the versionsof libraries used by APSuite. This can help other atom probers and AMETEK/Camecato improve their software as it will enable them to identify inconsistencies.Atom probers should be aware that file formats like POS, ePOS, or APT are neitherraw data nor follow a clear technical documentation. Therefore, all current fileformats are not meeting the FAIR principles. Instead, share RRAW, STR, RHIT, and HITS files.Ideally, you add unique identifiers (such as SHA256 checksums) for each file.A documentation how you can do this was issued by your IFES APT TC colleagues[(How to hash your data)](https://github.com/oxfordAPT/hashlist).If you cannot provide such detailed pieces of information, you can still participateand support us a lot if you share your knowledge by adding at least a link to a repositoryor file share with content in the relevant atom-probe-specific file formats.In this case, please use the *examples_without_provenance* directory.While these examples are stripped of the context in which they were createdand used (provenance information), these examples can still be very usefulto run the file formats parsers against to make the parsers more robust, i.e.that these can pick up formatting issues and act accordingly.# Background informationFile formats, data models, in (almost every) research field may not be fully documented.A checklist of the necessary pieces of information and documentation required to call adata model, data schema, and/or file format fully documented in accordance with theFAIR data and research software stewardship principles is given below:1. Each piece of information (bit/byte) is documented.2. This documentation fulfills the FAIR principles, i.e.   [Wilkinson et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18) and   [Barker et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01710-x)   For binary files, tools like [kaitai struct](https://kaitai.io/) offer a   solution to describe the exact binary information content in a data   item. This can be a file but also the storage of a database entry or the   response of a call to an API.   Let alone the binary structure is insufficient tough.3. To each piece of information there has to exist also a parameterized description,   what this piece of information conceptually means. One way to arrive at such   description is to use a data schema or ontology.   It is important to mention that the concepts in this schema/ontology have   unique identifier so that each data item/piece of information is identifiable   as an instance of an entry in a database or a knowledge graph.   This holds independently of which research data management system   or electronic lab notebook is used.4. In addition, it is very useful if timestamps are associated with each data item   (ISO8061 including time zone information) so that it is possible to create a   timeline of the context in which and when the e.g. file was created.The first and second point is known as a specification, while the third and fourthpoint emphasize that the contextualization and provenance is key to make aspecification complete and useful.</longdescription>

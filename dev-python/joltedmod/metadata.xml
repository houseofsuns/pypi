	<longdescription># JoltedModJoltedMod is a Python package that utilizes OpenAI's chat models to automatically generate Jupyter Notebook or Markdown-based computer science educational materials. This package can be integrated into a frontend application, such as a CLI or API, to serve educational content.## Features- Generate Jupyter Notebook or Markdown content based on a given topic- Highly configurable using tutorial template JSON structure- Customizable content creator identity and target audience- Support for GPT-3.5-turbo and other OpenAI models## InstallationTo install JoltedMod, you can use `pip`:```pip install jolted_mod```## UsageHere's an example of how to generate a Jupyter Notebook module for a given topic:```pythonimport asynciofrom jolted_mod.main import create_notebook_moduletopic = &quot;Intro to for loops in Python&quot;identity = &quot;professor of computer science&quot;target_audience = &quot;first year computer science students&quot;is_code = Truemodel = &quot;gpt-3.5-turbo&quot;tutorial_content = asyncio.run(create_notebook_module(topic, identity, target_audience, is_code, model))print(tutorial_content)```## ConfigurationYou can customize the generated content using a JSON template structure that outlines blocks. An example template file can be found in `tutorial_template.json`.## Development SetupJoltedMod uses Poetry for project management. To set up a development environment, follow these steps:1.

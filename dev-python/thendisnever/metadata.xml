	<longdescription># The End is NeverA package to make an LLM talk with itself forever.```pythonfrom thendisnever.thend import isneverisnever()```## `is_never()` parameters- `model_name`: The model to generate text with.  - [This](https://huggingface.co/togethercomputer/RedPajama-INCITE-Base-3B-v1) is the default model.  - This must be a model compatible with [AutoModelForCausalLM](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM).- `prompt`: The initial prompt for the model.  - [This](https://thestanleyparable.fandom.com/wiki/The_End_Is_Never...) is the inspiration for the default prompt.  - The length in tokens of the prompt must be less than the model's `max_length` (see [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/pad_truncation#padding-and-truncation) for more info).- `max_memory_ratio`: The % of past tokens to remember.  - This must be a real number between 0 and 1, since empty prompts are not allowed (0) and the prompt must be smaller than the model's context window for generation to work (1).## Notes- When running `isnever()` for the first time, it will download the model and tokenizer from HuggingFace. This will take a while, but it only needs to be done once.- If you want to use the CPU (not recommended because it's slow, but it works), make sure you have [PyTorch for CPU](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) installed before installing this package.## Contributing1. Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) if necessary.1. Create and setup the poetry environment:    ```bash    git clone https://github.com/andrewhinh/thendisnever.git    cd thendisnever    poetry shell    poetry install    ```1. Make your changes, remembering to update in `pyproject.toml` the `version` in the `tool.poetry` section and the `tool.poetry.dependencies` section as necessary.1. Build the package:    ```bash    poetry build    ```1. Test the package in a fresh environment:    ```bash    pip install dist/thendisnever-&lt;version&gt;.tar.gz    ```1. Once confirmed to work, make a PR from a feature branch to main on GitHub.1. Once PR is merged, [email me](mailto:ajhinh@gmail.com) to be added as a collaborator on PyPI.1. Once added as a collaborator, publish the package to `PyPI`:        ```bash      poetry config pypi-token.pypi &lt;your-token&gt; # Get your token from https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/      poetry publish      ```</longdescription>

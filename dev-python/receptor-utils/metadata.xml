	<longdescription># receptor_utilsSome tools I find useful for working with Ig receptor sequences, including support for allele sequence naming and the creation of custom IgBlast databases. Please see the [documentation](https://williamdlees.github.io/receptor_utils/_build/html/introduction.html)for further details.Changes in version 0.0.42:- better handling of long target sequencesChanges in version 0.0.41:- annotate_j: fix issue with processing FASTA inputChanges in version 0.0.40:- The submodule name receptor_utils.number_ighv has been changed to receptor_utils.number_v to reflect its wider scope. The old name will continueto work for the time being but will raise a deprecation warning.- In receptor_utils.simple_bio_seq, write_fasta(seqs, filename) has become write_fasta(filename, seqs) for consistency with write_csv. The oldcalling pattern will continue to work for the time being but will raise a deprecation warning.Changes in version 0.0.39:- annotate_j and make_igblast_ndm will now accept a germline set in AIRR Community JSON format, as an alternative to providing the set in FASTA format.Changes in version 0.0.38:- Improve reporting of issues with conserved residues- Change URL for fetching IMGT reference sets to use https</longdescription>

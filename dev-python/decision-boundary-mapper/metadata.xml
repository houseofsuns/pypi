	<longdescription># Short DescriptionThis is the package provides functionality for visualizing the classifiers decision boundaries.It is based on the work of Cristian Grosu for the master thesis project for 2023 at Utrecht University.If you use this package, please cite the following paper:[placeholder for the paper]The package is available on PyPI and can be installed using pip: `pip install decision-boundary-mapper`## DocumentationSee more details at `https://decisionboundarymapper.000webhostapp.com/`## Usage exmaples1. This package comes with a simple GUI that allows you to visualize the decision boundaries of a classifier. The GUI is based on the `PySimpleGUI` package and can be started by running the following code:```pythonfrom decision_boundary_mapper import GUIGUI().start()```2. The package comes with two examples of complete pipelines for visualizing the decision boundaries of a classifier.Both examples use `MNIST` (handwritten digits) dataset.The first example `DBM_usage_example` uses `t-SNE` to project the data from the `nD` space to the `2D` space, then neural network is trained to fit the inverse projection from `2D` to `nD` and the decision boundaries are visualized using the `2D` projection. The second example `DBM_usage_example_2` uses `UMAP` to project the data from the `nD` space to the `2D` space, then neural network is trained to fit the inverse projection from `2D` to `nD` and the decision boundaries are visualized using the `2D` projection. After which a simple classifier is used to color each point of the `2D` projection.The second example `SDM_usage_example` uses an Autoencoder Neural Network to project the data from the `nD` space to the `2D` space, then a simple classifier is used to color each point of the `2D` projection.The examples can be found in the `examples` folder.```pythonfrom decision_boundary_mapper import DBM_usage_example, SDM_usage_exampleDBM_usage_example() # run the first exampleSDM_usage_example() # run the second example```3. The package main functionality comes in two classes `DBM` (i.e. learns inverse projection when a 2D projection is given) and `SDBM` (i.e. learns both the projection and the inverse projection).The classes can be used as follows:```pythonfrom decision_boundary_mapper import DBM, SDBMfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt# load the data...X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = load_data() ...# create a simple neural network...classifier = ... # for compatibility with the package the classifier should be constructed using tensorflow.keras...dbm = DBM(classifier) # create a DBM objectimg, img_confidence, _, _, _, _ = dbm.generate_decision_boundary(X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test, resolution = 256) # generate the decision boundarysdbm = SDBM(classifier) # create a SDBM objectimg, img_confidence, _, _, _, _ = sdbm.generate_decision_boundary(X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test, resolution = 256) # generate the decision boundary...# visualize the decision boundariesplt.imshow(img)plt.show()```Created by Cristian Grosu for the master thesis project for 2023 at Utrecht University</longdescription>

	<longdescription>=============hashivaultlib=============An extension to hvac, implementing recursive removal and retrieval of secrets and models for tokens and policies.* Documentation: https://hashivaultlib.readthedocs.org/en/latestDevelopment Workflow====================The workflow supports the following steps * lint * test * build * document * upload * graphThese actions are supported out of the box by the corresponding scripts under _CI/scripts directory with sane defaults based on best practices.Sourcing setup_aliases.ps1 for windows powershell or setup_aliases.sh in bash on Mac or Linux will provide with handy aliases for the shell of all those commands prepended with an underscore.The bootstrap script creates a .venv directory inside the project directory hosting the virtual environment. It uses pipenv for that.It is called by all other scripts before they do anything. So one could simple start by calling _lint and that would set up everything before it tried to actually lint the projectOnce the code is ready to be delivered the _tag script should be called accepting one of three arguments, patch, minor, major following the semantic versioning scheme.So for the initial delivery one would call    $ _tag --minorwhich would bump the version of the project to 0.1.0 tag it in git and do a push and also ask for the change and automagically update HISTORY.rst with the version and the change provided.So the full workflow after git is initialized is: * repeat as necessary (of course it could be test - code - lint :) )   * code   * lint   * test * commit and push * develop more through the code-lint-test cycle * tag (with the appropriate argument) * build * upload (if you want to host your package in pypi) * document (of course this could be run at any point)Important Information=====================This template is based on pipenv. In order to be compatible with requirements.txt so the actual created package can be used by any part of the existing python ecosystem some hacks were needed.So when building a package out of this **do not** simple call    $ python setup.py sdist bdist_egg**as this will produce an unusable artifact with files missing.**Instead use the provided build and upload scripts that create all the necessary files in the artifact.Project Features================* TODOHistory-------0.1.0 (25-05-2018)------------------* First release0.2.0 (30-07-2018)------------------* Added concurrency in retrieving the tokens from the server.1.0.0 (16-10-2018)------------------* Ported the template part to python 3.7* Officially dropped support for python 2.71.0.2 (25-10-2018)------------------* Updated template and dependencies1.1.0 (29-11-2018)------------------* Updated to 0.7.0 of hvac1.1.1 (12-02-2019)------------------* Updated hvac to 0.7.21.1.2 (12-02-2019)------------------* Added pyhcl as a top level dependency1.1.3 (22-05-2019)------------------* Fixed retrieval and deletion of paths under windows clients1.1.4 (22-05-2019)------------------* fixed packaging by removing unneeded files from root1.1.5 (18-10-2019)------------------* Updated template and bumped dependencies1.1.6 (18-10-2019)------------------* Updated template and bumped dependencies1.1.7 (25-05-2020)------------------* Updated dependencies, providing terraform 12 compatibility.1.1.8 (25-05-2020)------------------* Bumped dependencies1.2.0 (16-10-2020)------------------* Implemented retrieve, restore and delete for v2 kv paths.1.2.1 (16-10-2020)------------------* Refactored loggers to not use the root one.1.3.0 (19-10-2020)------------------* Wrapped Invalid path exception.1.3.1 (28-12-2020)------------------* Updated underlying hvac dependency.1.3.2 (26-04-2021)------------------* Bumped dependencies.1.3.3 (26-04-2021)------------------* Bumped dependencies.1.3.4 (08-06-2021)------------------* Bumped dependencies.1.4.0 (09-12-2022)------------------* Set max_workers as param with default set to None* Set runner to ubuntu-20.04* Update pip lock</longdescription>

Create new Pull Request## FAQ### How to deal with multiple Java versions?This might be relevant for `pretty-format-java` and `pretty-format-kotlin` hooks.The hooks depends on having `java` on version **11** or greater installed on your machine.As you're working with _compiled-to-JVM_ languages, we assume that you have `java` installed on your system. You might not have the minimum required version installed.To work-around such scenario you have 2 approaches available:1. Have multiple `java` versions installed on your system and ensure that while running the pre-commit hooks JRE 11+ is available on your `PATH` variable (ie. `PATH=${JRE_11_PATH}:${PATH} pre-commit run`).2. Work around the issue by using [`docker`](https://www.docker.com/).    ⚠: This approach has been tested (at the time of writing) on Linux and MacOS.    The latter approach should be preferred if you cannot install an additional JRE version on your system or if doing is unfeasible (e.g. on a CI system). Please note you need to have `docker` installed on your system.    Add the following `Dockerfile` on your repository root (same directory where `.pre-commit-config.yaml` is stored)    ```Dockerfile    FROM python:3.7-alpine    # Install JRE-11 as we will run pre-commit hooks that depends an Java 11+    RUN apk add --no-cache openjdk11-jre    ENV PRE_COMMIT_HOME /pre-commit-docker-cache    ENV PRE_COMMIT_LANGUAGE_FORMATTERS_VERSION ${version of the library to install}    RUN set -x \        &amp;&amp; pip install --no-cache-dir language-formatters-pre-commit-hooks==${PRE_COMMIT_LANGUAGE_FORMATTERS_VERSION} \        # Run pre-commit-hook to ensure that jars are downloaded and stored in the docker image        # Run the hooks that you're planning to run within docker.        # This reduces premission issues as well has makes all the run fast as the lazy-dependencies are pre-fetched        &amp;&amp; pretty-format-java  \        # Update permissions as hooks will be run as your host-system user (your username) but the image is built as root        &amp;&amp; chmod a+r ${PRE_COMMIT_HOME}/*    ```    and the following hook into your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file    ```yaml    repos:    - repo: local      hooks:      - id: pretty-format-java-in-docker    # Useful to eventually SKIP pre-commit hooks        name: pretty-format-java-in-docker  # This is required, put something sensible        language: docker                    # Self explanatory        entry: pretty-format-java           # Hook that you want to run in docker        args: [...]                         # Arguments that would would pass to the hook (as if it was local)        files: ^.*\.java$                   # File filter has to be added ;)    ```    By doing the following, the selected hook (`pretty-format-java` in the example) will be executed within the docker container.    Side note: We're not embedding the Dockerfile in the repository as this is more a workaround to support whom cannot of installing a more recent Java version on the library-user system and as such we are not planning to fully support this other than giving possible solutions (Java 11+ was released in September, 2018).## License`language-formatters-pre-commit-hooks` is licensed with [`Apache License version 2.0`](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).Changelog=========2.8.0 (2023-03-17)------------------- Update GoogleJavaFormatter to 1.16.02.7.0 (2023-02-18)------------------- Add support for customisable offset in `pretty-format-yaml` - [PR #143](https://github.com/macisamuele/language-formatters-pre-commit-hooks/pull/143)- Update KTLint to 0.48.22.6.0 (2023-01-20)------------------- Fix `pertty-format-toml` to be compatible with latest `toml-sort` libraries - Thanks [@liblaf](https://github.com/liblaf) and [@stewartHutchins](https://github.com/stewartHutchins) for the support on having toml prettification working again  The fix has been carried over multiple PRs ([PR #134](https://github.com/macisamuele/language-formatters-pre-commit-hooks/pull/134), [PR #136](https://github.com/macisamuele/language-formatters-pre-commit-hooks/pull/136) and [PR #137](https://github.com/macisamuele/language-formatters-pre-commit-hooks/pull/137)).- Internal build fix (failures caused by `tox` major release) - [PR #141](https://github.com/macisamuele/language-formatters-pre-commit-hooks/pull/141), inspired from [PR #135](https://github.com/macisamuele/language-formatters-pre-commit-hooks/pull/135) - Thanks [@malmans2](https://github.com/malmans2) for the support- Update KTlint to 0.48.1 - [PR #140](https://github.com/macisamuele/language-formatters-pre-commit-hooks/pull/140) - Thanks [@detouched](https://github.com/detouched) for the upgrade2.5.0 (2022-12-05)------------------- Lift JDK 16+ restriction - [PR #123](https://github.com/macisamuele/language-formatters-pre-commit-hooks/pull/123) - [@harti2006](https://github.com/harti2006) thanks for your contribution- Update KTlint to 0.47.1 - [PR #125](https://github.com/macisamuele/language-formatters-pre-commit-hooks/pull/125)- pretty_format_rust does no longer use explicit rust versions - [PR #126](https://github.com/macisamuele/language-formatters-pre-commit-hooks/pull/126)2.4.0 (2022-07-01)------------------- Update GoogleJavaFormatter to 1.15.0- Update KTlint to 0.45.1- Ensure Python 3.10 support and drop Python3.6 guaranteed support - [PR #114](https://github.com/macisamuele/language-formatters-pre-commit-hooks/pull/114) / [PR #115](https://github.com/macisamuele/language-formatters-pre-commit-hooks/pull/115)- Updated prettifier library for INI files (from `configobj` to `config_formatter`) to provide more deterministic output and proper comments handling - [PR #113](https://github.com/macisamuele/language-formatters-pre-commit-hooks/pull/113) - [@Delgan](https://github.com/Delgan) thanks for your contribution- `pretty-format-yaml` allows customization of max line length - [PR #104](https://github.com/macisamuele/language-formatters-pre-commit-hooks/pull/104)- More explicit error messages in case of prettifier failires - [PR #116](https://github.com/macisamuele/language-formatters-pre-commit-hooks/pull/116)- Use explicit encoding within INI prettifier - [PR #102](https://github.com/macisamuele/language-formatters-pre-commit-hooks/pull/102) - [@hbre](https://github.com/hbre) thanks for your contribution2.3.0 (2022-02-17)------------------- Update GoogleJavaFormatter to 1.14.0- Update KTlint to 0.44.0- Use explicit encoding within YAML prettifier - [PR #92](https://github.com/macisamuele/language-formatters-pre-commit-hooks/pull/92) - [@passionsfrucht](https://github.com/passionsfrucht) thanks for your contribution2.2.0 (2021-08-08)------------------- Make download of external artifacts resilient to systems with temporary directory on different disk partitions - [@psmit](https://github.com/psmit) and [@kbalston](https://github.com/kbalston) thanks for your contribution- Make usage of Google Java Formatter compatible with JDK16+ - [@ostrya](https://github.com/ostrya) thanks for your contribution- Update GoogleJavaFormatter to 1.11.0- Bump KTlint to 0.42.1- Misc github workflow updates (testing on Python 3.9, better tracking of tool versions tested, etc.)- Improved error message in case of Google Java Formatter and KTLint not supported Java Versionℹ: `pretty-format-java` now supports Java 16+⚠: `pretty-format-kotlin` supports Java up to Java 152.1.0 (2021-05-28)------------------- Bump KTlint to 0.40.0- Update GoogleJavaFormatter to 1.10.02.0.0 (2021-01-16)------------------- Preserve comments in while formatting `ini` files.

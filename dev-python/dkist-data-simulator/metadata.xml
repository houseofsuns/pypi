	<longdescription>A header generator and FITS file creator for DKIST data-------------------------------------------------------This package is designed to generate sets of FITS files which represent DKIST level 0 and level 1 data.These generated data should not be considered as a promise of what will be delivered when real data is obtained, these products are still a work in progress.Using-----Generating Pesudo Random Data#############################The simplest way to generate data is to to use the `dkist_data_simulator.spec122.Spec122Dataset` or `dkist_data_simulator.spec214.Spec214Dataset` classes.To generate a header::  &gt;&gt;&gt; from dkist_data_simulator.spec122 import Spec122Dataset  &gt;&gt;&gt; ds = Spec122Dataset(dataset_shape=(1, 512, 512), array_shape=(1, 512, 512), time_delta=10)  &gt;&gt;&gt; ds.header()A complete list of headers for all frames in the dataset can be generated with the ``generate_headers`` method.It is also possible to iterate over a dataset, this changes the ``.index`` property.This can be used to generate a sequence of headers one at a time::  &gt;&gt;&gt; header_generator = (d.header() for d in ds)It can also be used to generate files in memory::  &gt;&gt;&gt; import io  &gt;&gt;&gt; file_generator = (d.file(io.BytesIO()) for d in ds)Customising the Generated Data##############################To customise the data being generated, subclass a dataset.To add new headers, either the ``add_constant_key`` method, or the ``add_generator_function`` methods can be used in the constructor.Also a shorthand way of having a function generate key values is to use the `dkist_data_simulator.dataset.key_function` decorator.  &gt;&gt;&gt; from dkist_data_simulator.dataset import key_function  &gt;&gt;&gt; from dkist_data_simulator.spec122 import Spec122Dataset  &gt;&gt;&gt; class ExampleDataset(Spec122Dataset):  ...     def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):  ...         super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)  ...         # Add a header key with a given, fixed value over all headers  ...         self.add_constant_key(&quot;INSTRUME&quot;, &quot;Example&quot;)  ...         # Add a header key with a given, single random value over all headers  ...         self.add_constant_key(&quot;EXPER_ID&quot;)  ...  ...     @key_function(&quot;FRAMEVOL&quot;)  ...     def framevol(self, key):  ...         return 10To remove a key from a generated header (for instance to generate invalid data), overload the ``header()`` method and remove keys before returning::  &gt;&gt;&gt; class InvalidDataset(Spec122Dataset):  ...     def header(self, *args, **kwargs):  ...         header = super().header(*args, **kwargs)  ...         header.pop(&quot;NAXIS&quot;)  ...         return headerLicense-------This project is Copyright (c) AURA / NSO and licensed underthe terms of the BSD 3-Clause license.

No, really.There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're notready to be an open source contributor; that your skills aren't nearly goodenough to contribute. What could you possibly offer a project like this one?We assure you - the little voice in your head is wrong. If you can write code atall, you can contribute code to open source. Contributing to open sourceprojects is a fantastic way to advance one's coding skills. Writing perfect codeisn't the measure of a good developer (that would disqualify all of us!); it'strying to create something, making mistakes, and learning from thosemistakes. That's how we all improve, and we are happy to help others learn.Being an open source contributor doesn't just mean writing code, either. You canhelp out by writing documentation, tests, or even giving feedback about theproject (and yes - that includes giving feedback about the contributionprocess). Some of these contributions may be the most valuable to the project asa whole, because you're coming to the project with fresh eyes, so you can seethe errors and assumptions that seasoned contributors have glossed over.Note: This disclaimer was originally written by`Adrienne Lowe &lt;https://github.com/adriennefriend&gt;`_ for a`PyCon talk &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Uj746j9Heo&gt;`_, and was adapted bydkist-data-simulator based on its use in the README file for the`MetPy project &lt;https://github.com/Unidata/MetPy&gt;`_.</longdescription>

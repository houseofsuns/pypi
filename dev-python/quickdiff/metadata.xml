	<longdescription># quickdiff`quickdiff` is a python library for quickly finding nested differences between two python objects.## Usage:```python from quickdiff import *a = {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: [3], 4: 4}b = {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: [3, 4], 5: 5, 6: 6}report = quickdiff(a, b)assert report == DiffReport(    val_changes=[ValChange(path=[2], a=2, b=4)],    type_and_val_changes=[],    dict_items_added=[DictDiff(path=[], key=5, val=5), DictDiff(path=[], key=6, val=6)],    dict_items_removed=[DictDiff(path=[], key=4, val=4)],    iter_len_mismatch=[IterLenMismatch(path=[3], a_len=1, b_len=2)])```Diff objects (`ValChange`, `DictDiff`, etc) are NamedTuples for improved ergonomics and thus can be unpacked as you would any tuple:```pythonfor path, a, b in report.val_changes:    print(path, a, b)# ([2], 2, 4)```## Why not DeepDiffI wrote this because [DeepDiff](https://pypi.org/project/deepdiff/) is quite slow as it's written in pure Python and has a lot of features.Quickdiff on the other hand is simple and written in Rust. The current implementation yields a 16x performance boost on my personal benchmarks.## DevelopmentUse `maturin` for development:```bashpip install maturin```Compile development version with:```bashmaturin development```Run tests:```bashpython -m unittest discover tests```## Roadmap- [ ] support for sets (currently is treated as an iterator)- [ ] parallelize for improved performance (by using `pyo3-ffi` to sidestep the Python runtime)- [ ] attribute diff checking for python objects- [ ] support custom `__eq__()` implementations</longdescription>

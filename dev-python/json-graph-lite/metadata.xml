	<longdescription>Lightweight library for JSON graph ==================================Library, similar to:https://github.com/jsongraph/jsongraph.py**NB: `json-graph-lite` library uses list for nodes, not object, so it's not compatible with JSON Graph Format.**JSON Graph Format compatible classes (Graph, Graphs) can be found from `json_graph_lite.jgf`.Incompatible change: list is used for nodes, not object, because JSON object can't represent integer keys.The intention of json-graph-lite is to provide lightweight graph library, which serializesand deserializes graphs a la JSON graph format.Take a look at [tests/test_graphs.py](tests/test_graphs.py) for usage examples.</longdescription>

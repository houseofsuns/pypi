	<longdescription># inspect2A backport of the Python 3.6 inspect module to Python 2.7-3.5.This module was based on the code of the inspect module and its tests in the Python 3.6 standard library and modified to pass tests on earlier Python versions.I have tried to follow these rules in writing the code:- Minimize changes relative to the 3.6 source. This should make backporting of future   changes easier.- No support for old-style classes. Python 2 is hard enough without them.- All functions should be available on all versions. `inspect2.iscoroutinefunction()`   just always returns False on Python versions that don't have `async def`.</longdescription>

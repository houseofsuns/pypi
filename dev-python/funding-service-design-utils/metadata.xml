	<longdescription># funding-service-design-utilsShared library for funding service design apps.This library can be installed into other python repos and the packages used by those repos.# Dev setupIn order to run the unit tests, setup a virtual env and install requirements1. Checkout the code1. Setup a venv and activate: `python3 -m venv .venv &amp;&amp; source .venv/bin/activate`1. Install dev requirements: `pip install --upgrade pip &amp;&amp; pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`1. Install pre-commit hook: `pre-commit install`1. Run tests with `pytest`1. If you add any packages needed by services that consume `fsd_utils`, add them into `pyproject.yaml`.# ReleasingTo create a new release of funding-service-design-utils (note no longer need to manually update the version):1. Make and test your changes as normal in this repo1. Push your changes to `main`.1. The Action at `.github/workflows/test-and-tag.yml` will create a new tag and release, named for the version in `pyproject.toml`. This is triggered automatically on a push to main.1. That action will also push this tag up to PyPI at: https://pypi.org/project/funding-service-design-utils/## Updating the release workflow- If making changes to the release flow etc, you can publish to test.pypi.org when testing. To do this, update the `Publish to PyPI` step with the following:```    - name: Publish to PyPI      id: publish-to-pypi      uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1      with:        password: ${{ secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN_TEST }}        repository_url: https://test.pypi.org/legacy/```- That will publish packages to https://test.pypi.org/project/funding-service-design-utils/ instead, without updating the index of the main PyPI repo.- Don't forget to change it back when you're done!# UsageEither of the following options will install the funding-service-design-utils into your python project. The package `fsd_utils` can then be imported.## Released versionTo reference a particular tag from pip, add the following to your `requirements.txt` file or use `pip install` (update version as appropriate):    funding-service-design-utils==0.0.1## Latest / in-dev versionTo reference the latest commit from a particular branch from pip, add the following to your `requirements.txt` file or use `pip install`:pip install    pip install git+https://github.com/communitiesuk/funding-service-design-utils.git@&lt;branchName&gt;**or**To navigate requirements.txt to your branch:Replace `funding-service-design-utils` in `requirements.in` with    git+https://github.com/communitiesuk/funding-service-design-utils.git@&lt;branchName&gt;Build requirements with following commands    pip-compile requirements.in    pip-compile requirements-dev.in    python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip &amp;&amp; pip install -r requirements-dev.txtBuild docker with following commands    docker compose build &lt;service_name&gt; --no-cache    or    docker compose build --no-cache## Local changesWhen working and testing locally, you can also install the `fsd_utils` package from your local filesystem:    pip uninstall -y funding-service-design-utils    pip install /path/to/your/working/directory/funding-service-design/utilsNote: When testing locally using the docker runner, docker might use the cached version of fsd_utils. to avoid this and pick up your intended changes, run `docker compose build &lt;service_name&gt; --no-cache` first before running `docker compose up`.# Utilities## The configclassCurrently the configclass allows for pretty print debugging of config keys and the class from which they are created. This allows devs to quickly diagnoise problems arrising from incorrectly set config. To activate this functionality, one must decorate each config class with the `@configclass` decorator.## Common ConfigThis defines config values that are common across different services, eg. url patterns. Usage example:```from fsd_utils import CommonConfig@configclassclass DefaultConfig:    SECRET_KEY = CommonConfig.SECRET_KEY```## GunicornThe gunicorn utility allows consistent configuration of gunicorn across microservices.To use it,First - add run/gunicorn directory in your application with config scripts that import the appropriate config from this util's choice of config files eg.    # in run/gunicorn/local.py    from fsd_utils.gunicorn.config.local import *  # noqaThen - add a wsgi.py script to the root of your application eg.    # in wsgi.py    from app import app    if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:        app.run()Finally - To run with gunicorn, call the gunicorn command in your manifest.yml's or in the terminal, passing the wsgi application and the appropriate configuration file as arguments eg.in the terminal:    gunicorn wsgi:app -c run/gunicorn/dev.pyin a manifest file:    # manifest-dev.yml    ---    applications:        ...        command: gunicorn wsgi:app -c run/gunicorn/devtest.py## LoggingThe logging utility formats logs to a consistent format (text in development and json in other environments).The utility also supports logging from gunicornTo use it add the following to your flask create_app factory    from fsd_utils.logging import logging    def create_app():        ...        # Initialise logging        logging.init_app(flask_app)and in your env config classes, specify the log level you want to report eg.:    @configclass    class DefaultConfig(object):        ...        # Logging        FSD_LOG_LEVEL = logging.WARNING## AuthenticationThe authentication utility provides a consistent authentication functions including a `@login_required` decorator that can be used to restrict routes that should only be accessible to authenticated users.To use the utility:First - ensure that the following environment variables are set to the appropriate values eg.:    FSD_USER_TOKEN_COOKIE_NAME = &quot;fsd_user_token&quot;    AUTHENTICATOR_HOST = &quot;https://funding-service-design-authenticator-dev.london.cloudapps.digital&quot;    RSA256_PUBLIC_KEY = &quot;{RSA PUBLIC KEY}&quot;NOTE: These values (and keys) need to be shared/common across all microservices that use each common authenticator host. If any of the environment *keys* for each of these attributes needs to be modified these can be reconfigured in fsd_utils/authentication/config.py.To generate new keys in your cwd, you use the following commands:```bashopenssl genrsa -out private_key.pem 2048openssl rsa -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem```If you're changing keys, you'll need to change them in GitHub secrets across repos.Please also add them to BitWarden and let the team know.Then - to use the `@login_required` decorator just add it to routes you need to protect eg:    # in ...routes.py    from fsd_utils.authentication.decorators import login_required    @login_required    def example_route(account_id):        #...account_id will be available here if the user is authenticated        #...if not logged in the user will be redirected to re-authenticate## HealthchecksAdds the route `/healthcheck` to an application. On hitting this endpoint, a customisable set of checks are run to confirm the application is functioning as expected and a JSON response is returned.Response codes:- 200: All checks were successful, application is healthy- 500: One or more checks failed, application is unhealthyExample usage:```from fsd_utils.healthchecks.healthcheck import Healthcheckfrom fsd_utils.healthchecks.checkers import DbChecker, FlaskRunningCheckerhealth = Healthcheck(flask_app)health.add_check(FlaskRunningChecker())health.add_check(DbChecker(db))```The above will initialise the `/healthcheck` url and adds 2 checks.### ChecksThe following 2 checks are provided in `fsd_utils` in `checkers.py`:- `FlaskRunningChecker`: Checks whether a `current_app` is available from flask, returns `True` if it is, `False` if not.- `DbChecker`: Runs a simple query against the DB to confirm database availability.### Implementing custom checksCustom checks can be created as subclasses of `CheckerInterface` and should contain a method with the following signature:`def check(self) -&gt; Tuple[bool, str]:`Where- `bool` is a True or False whether the check was successful- `str` is a message to display in the result JSON, typically `OK` or `Fail`## TranslationsMultiple language support is provided by `flask-babel`. Docs here: https://python-babel.github.io/flask-babel/#### Python SetupThe python setup relies on 2 methods and an initialisation. In `create_app` we initialise `babel` on our app:    from fsd_utils.locale_selector.get_lang import get_lang    babel = Babel(flask_app)    babel.locale_selector_func = get_lang    LanguageSelector(flask_app)The `get_lang()` function reads the user-selected language from a cookie (if set by `LanguageSelector` - see below), or if that is not present uses a built-in function of babel to negotiate the language based on the request headers and the supported languages.`LanguageSelector` creates an additional route `/language/&lt;language&gt;` that sets the user's selected language in a cookie. Used the cookie rather than the session so it can be shared across the microservices.Set `COOKIE_DOMAIN` on the app to the domain you want to set the cookie on.### Creating Translations1. Add `trans` tags around items in your jinja html file that you want to translate. What's contained in the `trans` tag should be the english version of this text. eg:        A greeting is: {% trans %}Good Morning{% endtrans %}1. Generate a new translations template file (`messages.pot`)        pybabel extract -F babel.cfg -o messages.pot .1. If initialising a new set of translations for a new repo or adding a new language, use `init`. *This will override any changes already made in the `translations` directory!*        # Initialise a welsh translations file in app/translations        pybabel init -i messages.pot -d app/translations -l cy    The directory supplied to `-d` (eg. `app/translations`) must sit at the same level as the `templates` folder, in our case within the `app` directory. This command generates a new `messages.po` file in `translations/cy/LC_MESSAGES/` Where `cy` is the language code. (cy = Welsh/Cymraeg)1. If you've added new strings to an existing template, or added new templates after running `init`, use `update`:        pybabel update -i messages.pot -d app/translations    This will append new strings to the existing `messages.po` file, preserving any translations you already have in there.1. To add translations for strings, edit the `messages.po` file.        #: app/templates/index.html:10        msgid &quot;Good Morning&quot;        msgstr &quot;Bore da&quot;    where `msgid` is the english version of the string from the original template file, and `msgstr` is the translation of the string.1. Once the translations are ready, use `compile` to generate the binary for use at runtime:        pybabel compile -d app/translations## SentryEnables Sentry integration.* Before the flask app is created initialise Sentry using```from fsd_utils import init_sentryinit_sentry()```* Set the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable on the app## Simple UtilsFolder to hold miscellaneous simple utilities.### date_utilsDate comparison functions that accept an ISO Format string, for use in the frontend determining display logic based on dates.## FixturesContains shared fixtures that can be used for unit tests in other repos. To include a fixture from `fsd_utils` in your project, add the following to your `conftest.py`:    pytest_plugins = [&quot;fsd_test_utils.fixtures.db_fixtures&quot;]Where the part inside `[]` is the paths to the python files you want to load as fixtures.### DB_FixturesIndividual fixtures are explained below, but this is the general expected usage. In the `conftest.py` of your repo, define a fixture that will seed the database with the test data you require and make those records avaialble to tests. That fixture should request `clear_test_data` and `enable_preserve_test_data` to prevent test pollution and ensure a suitable database is available for tests. The tests themselves should only update data that is inserted by that fixture. Examples:1. Basic Usage    In conftest.py        @pytest.fixture(scope=&quot;function&quot;)        def create_test_data(clear_test_data, enable_preserve_test_data):            # Logic to insert some test data            created_data = [all_created_data]            yield created_data            # No teardown logic required as this is covered in clear_test_data    In your test file        def test_get_data(create_test_data):            id = create_test_data[0].id            record = get_record_using_api_under_test(id)            assert record.id == id1. If your tests need to directly manipulate the database, use the `_db` fixture:        def test_after_update(create_test_data, _db):            id = create_test_data[0].id            record = get_record(id)            record.name = &quot;new name&quot;            _db.session.add(record)            _db.session.commit()            # Do some further tests post update1. If you want to be able to inspect the database after running a test:        @pytest.mark.preserve_test_data(True)        def test_get_data(create_test_data):            id = create_test_data[0].id            record = get_record_using_api_under_test(id)            assert record.id == id    After the test runs, any created data will still be there for manual inspection. It will then be removed at the start of the next test run.#### clear_test_dataThis fixture is module scoped so at the end of each test file all data is removed from the database (providing `preserve_test_data` is not set - see below.) Helps to prevent test pollution.#### enable_preserve_test_dataThis fixture looks for the marker `pytest.mark.preserve_test_data(True)` and if found, test data is not cleared at the end of the test session, allowing you to manually inspect the database to aid debugging.**Note**: Not intended to be used as a default for tests as it can lead to test pollution, so only use to debug and then remove again.#### _dbProvides direct access to the database for tests. Useful if your test needs to explicitly insert/update records to prepare test data.#### recreate_dbThis fixture reads the pytest cache to determine whether the DB can be reused for this test run and then the db is recreated accordingly. Updates the cache value to enable reuse of the DB for future test runs. This is session scoped so the DB is not recreated for each test in a run.This is requested by `clear_test_data` so you do not need to include it separately in your project if using that fixture.## MappingThe mapping feature serves the purpose of mapping and formatting the questions and answers of the application into a text file. This functionality is utilised in the following scenarios:- Within the assessment service, it facilitates the downloading of the application's questions and answers.- In the notification service, it enables the posting of the applicant's application answer.To accomplish the mapping of the application's questions and answers, import    from fsd_utils import extract_questions_and_answersTo format the questions and answers of the application into a text file, import    from fsd_utils import generate_text_of_application</longdescription>

	<longdescription>epyunit=======Abstract--------The **ePyUnit package** provides extensions for the integrated**Testautomation and Debugging** of executables and scipts as subprocesses.Technically **ePyUnit** provides extensions for the**PyUnit** and **PyDev**/**Eclipse**  frameworks for blackbox testsand seamless integrated debugging of executables and scripts including nested  calls of subprocesses.The standard frameworks, libraries and IDEs provide components as presentedby the following figure.::    .                                 :       +----------------+             :       +---------------------------+       |    unittest    |             :       |  scripts and executables  |       +---+------------+---+         :       +---+-----------------------+---+           |   automation   |         :           |       debugging           |           +----------------+         :           +---------------------------+    .                                 :These are extended by framework features for theseamless cross-process integration of scripts and programs.::    .    +------------------------------+       +-----------------------------+    |   automation and unittest    |       |   seamless cross-process    |    |        for arbitrary         | &lt;---&gt; |          debugging          |    |   scripts and executables    |       |                             |    +------------------------------+       +-----------------------------+    |&lt;---                     seamless integration                   ---&gt;|    .The included automation extension for the PyDev/Eclipse based debuggingof -- local and remote -- Python subprocesses provides simplified support of detailed error analysisin case of test failures.Blueprint---------The *'ePyUnit' package* provides a minimal but sufficient approach in particular forthe low-effort test automation of scripts and tools suitable for operations oflarge scale application tests as well as for daily and advanced DevOps tasks.* ePyUnit encapsulates processes and relies on PyUnit for commandline  based unit and regression tests. The main focus is general blackbox testing  of executables, for Python in addition the automation of PyDev debugging  is included , see 'https://pythonhosted.org/epyunit/call_integration.html'.* ePyUnit integrates into PyDev for the support of the graphical  Eclipse IDE of unit testing and integrated graphical debugging,  this is also supported for external processes started independently  from the commandline, see 'https://pythonhosted.org/epyunit/pydevd_integration.html'.The ePyUnit components call the wrapped process and read the execution resultsfrom STDOUT, STDERR, and the exit value. The values are cached by Pythonvariables either for further processing, or optional pass-through to the caller.The architecture is based on the packages 'PyUnit' and 'PyDev'::                       +-----------------------+     call      +-----------------------+                       |                       |    ------&gt;    |                       |    Subprocess         |        ePyUnit        |               |  Wrapped-Executable   |                       |                       |    &lt;-----     |                       |                       +-----------------------+     stdin     +-----------------------+                                   |                 stderr                |                                   |                 exit                  V                                   |                           +-----------------------+    PyDev Remote                   |                           |        PyDevRDC       |   Debug into    Debug Server                   |                           +-----------------------+   subprocess                                   |                                       |                   . . . . . . . . | . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | . . . . . . . .                                   |                                       |                                   V                                       V                       +-----------------------+               +-----------------------+    Python Units       |         PyUnit        |     &lt;---&gt;     |         PyDev         |                       +-----------------------+               +-----------------------+                           |               |                              |                           V               V                             /                     +-----------+   +-----------+                      /    IDE              |    CLI    |   |  Eclipse  |&lt;--------------------/                     +-----------+   +-----------+The test components collect internally the data of multiple output sources anddecide based on the selection of the user parameters whether the test was successful or has failed.Therefore a similar approach to Fuzzy-Logic is applied on mixed results consisting of partialfailures and success.The provided scenarios are single level subprocesses::    +----------------+      +------------+    | Python-Process | &lt;--&gt; | Subprocess |    +----------------+      +------------+and nested multilevel scripts and executables as subprocesses::    +----------------+      +------------+            +------------+    | Python-Process | &lt;--&gt; | Subprocess | &lt;- ... --&gt; | Subprocess |    +----------------+      +------------+            +------------+Where each level of subprocesses could start an arbitrary number of local and remotesubprocesses itself, and either correlate or pass-through the results.Due to some bugfixes the backport from Python3.x *subprocess32* is optionallysupported when present.The provided package comprises functional atoms for various UseCases, as wellas extension classes for the 'unittest' package to be used in combinationwith PyUnit and PyDev..The 'epyunit' package provides in particular:* Support for unit tests of shell scripts - **bash** - from command line and Eclipse/PyDev* The simplified reuse of executables as test-dummies within multiple test cases.* The categorization of structures defined by the directory tree.* The support of arbitrary intermixed implementation languages for executables.The implementation supports Python(&gt;=2.7) and integrates into the Eclipse IDEwith PyDev, and PyUnit.The package 'epyunit' is a spin off from the project 'UnifiedSessionsManager-2.0'.For examples and patterns see subdirectories:* UseCases* tests**Downloads**:* Sourceforge.net: https://sourceforge.net/projects/epyunit/files/* Github: https://github.com/ArnoCan/epyunit/**Online documentation**:* Documentation: https://pythonhosted.org/epyunit/* API: https://pythonhosted.org/epyunit/epydoc/* PyPi: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/epyunit/**setup.py**The installer adds a few options to the standard setuptools options.* *build_doc*: Creates the integrated documentation for runtime systems including API in 'epyunit/build/apidoc/epyunit'.* *install_doc*: Installs documents into source project 'epyunit/doc', and the 'HOME' or 'AppData'.* *build_sphinx*: Creates documentation for runtime system by Sphinx, html only.

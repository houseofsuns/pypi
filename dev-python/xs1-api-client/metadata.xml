Since there is no way for us to knowabout this change, it's impossible for us to tell that the device number we use for an already created device objectdoes not correspond to the correct device anymore without fetching all devices again, which requires the recreationof all device objects.**TL;DR:****Do not change the order of the devices in the XS1 Gateway** if you can avoid it, and if you do,restart the service that relies on xs1-api-client to force a re-fetch of all devices.How to use==========Installation------------``pip install xs1-api-client``Usage-----For a basic example have a look at the [example.py] file. If you needmore info have a look at the [documentation] which should help.Basic Example-------------Create the API Object~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The basic way of creating an API object is by providing connection infodirectly when creating it:.. code-block:: python    from xs1_api_client import api as xs1api    from xs1_api_client import api_constants    # Create an api object with private configuration    api = xs1api.XS1(host='192.168.2.20', user=&quot;Username&quot;, password=&quot;Password&quot;)This will automatically try to connect to the gateway with the given credentials and retrieve basicgateway information which you can output like this:.. code-block:: python    print(&quot;Gateway Hostname: &quot; + api.get_gateway_name())    print(&quot;Gateway MAC: &quot; + api.get_gateway_mac())    print(&quot;Gateway Hardware Version: &quot; + api.get_gateway_hardware_version())    print(&quot;Gateway Bootloader Version: &quot; + api.get_gateway_bootloader_version())    print(&quot;Gateway Firmware Version: &quot; + api.get_gateway_firmware_version())    print(&quot;Gateway uptime: &quot; + str(api.get_gateway_uptime()) + &quot; seconds&quot;)You can also specify a custom port and enable SSL:.. code-block:: python    api = xs1api.XS1(host='192.168.2.20', port=1234, ssl=True, user=&quot;Username&quot;, password=&quot;Password&quot;)Now that you have a connection to your gateway we can retrieve itsconfiguration and set or retrieve values of configured actuators and sensors or even modify their configuration.Devices~~~~~~~All devices that you have configured in your XS1 are implemented usingthe ``XS1Device`` base class which can be found at ``/device/__init__.py``.This class provides basic functionality for every device like gettingthe **id**, **name**, **type** and other values.Retrieve Actuators~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~To retrieve a list of all 64 actuators use the following call:.. code-block:: python    actuators = api.get_all_actuators()This will return a list of ``XS1Actuator`` objects which is another baseclass for all actuators. You can use something like this to print allyour actuators:.. code-block:: python    for actuator in actuators:        print(&quot;Actuator &quot; + str(actuator.id()) + &quot;: &quot; + actuator.name() + &quot; (&quot; + str(actuator.type()) + &quot;)&quot;)There is also an integrated ``__str__`` method to print out most of the useful properties just like this:.. code-block:: python    for actuator in actuators:        print(actuator)You can also filter the elements by ``enabled`` and ``disabled`` state using:.. code-block:: python    enabled_actuators = api.get_all_actuators(True)Retrieve a single actuator simply by using:.. code-block:: python    actuator_1 = api.get_actuator(1)Retrieve an Actuator Value~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~To retrieve the current value of an actuator just call:.. code-block:: python    current_value = actuator.value()Set a new Actuator value~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~To set a new value to this actuator use:.. code-block:: python    actuator.set_value(100)This will send the required request to the XS1 and set the ``new_value``property to your value. Most of the time this value is setinstantaneously is in sync with the ``value`` property. However if thisvalue is different from the standard ``value`` the XS1 gateway is stilltrying to update the value on the remote device. For some devices thiscan take up to a couple of minutes (f.ex. FHT 80B heating).Updating Actuator Information~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Currently there is **no callback** when the value is finally updated so**you have to update the device information manually** if you want toget an update on its current state:.. code-block:: python    actuator.update()After that the usual methods like ``actuator.value()`` will respond withthe updated state.Executing Actuator Functions~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~If you have defined function presets for a device you can get a list ofall functions using:.. code-block:: python    functions = actuator.get_functions()and print them like this:.. code-block:: python    for function in functions:        print(function)to execute one of the functions type:.. code-block:: python    function.execute()This will (like set\_value) update the device state immediately with thegateways response. Remember though that there can be a delay for sendingthis value to the actual remote device like mentioned above.Retrieve a List of Sensors~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~To retrieve a list of all 64 sensors use the following call:.. code-block:: python    sensors = api.get_all_sensors()Just like with actuators you can filter the elements by ``enabled`` and ``disabled`` state using:.. code-block:: python    enabled_sensors = api.get_all_sensors(True)| This will return a list of ``XS1Sensor`` objects which is the base  class for all sensors.| You can print basic information about them like this:.. code-block:: python    for sensor in sensors:        print(&quot;Sensor &quot; + str(sensor.id()) + &quot;: &quot; + sensor.name() + &quot; (&quot; + str(sensor.value()) + &quot;)&quot;)Just like mentioned above you can also use:.. code-block:: python    for sensor in sensors:        print(sensor)or:.. code-block:: python    sensor_1 = api.get_sensor(1)to retrieve a specific sensor.Updating Sensor Information~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Just like with actuators there is no automatic updates for sensorseither. To get a state update from the XS1 gateway for your sensorobject call:.. code-block:: python    sensor.update()After that the complete state of this sensor is updated.Disabled Devices~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The XS1 allows up to 64 actuator and 64 sensor configurations. These 128device configurations are accessible via the HTTP API at any time - evenwhen there is nothing configured for a specific device id/number.To check if a device has been configured (and enabled) in the XS1 web interface call:.. code-block:: python    device.enabled()for both actuators and sensors alike.Get a device configuration~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Since version 2.0 it is possible to get and set device configurations on the XS1 using this library.Please have a look at the ``example_config.py`` file to get an idea of how to retrieve a device configuration.Modify a device configuration~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~**Before you proceed**Every configuration change will write to the internal flash memory of the XS1.Please keep in mind that that the use flash memory can and will probably degrade when written too often.Copy a device configuration~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~There is a very detailed example in this project called ``example_config_copy_actuator.py`` that will show youhow to copy a device configuration and also explains most of the important configuration parameters you will haveto use to set a custom configuration. Keep in mind though that the configuration parameters can vary between devicetypes and systems.Contributing============Github is for social coding: if you want to write code, I encourage contributions through pull requests from forks of this repository.

Quick start~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~**1.1 Feature prioritization:*****************************************  This function primarily includes peak picking, peak alignment, and blank comparison to prioritize features that are unique to the sample compared to the blank.To ensure that the program distinguishes between the sample set and the control set, include the strings 'methanol', 'blank', and 'control' in your control set files, and exclude these strings from your sample set files... code-block:: python    path = '../Users/Desktop/my_HRMS_files'    company = 'Waters'    pms.multi_process(path, company, profile=True, control_group=['lab_blank', 'methanol'], processors=1, ms2_analysis=True,                  area_threshold=200, filter_type=2).. note::   Parameters explanation:   - path: The file path for the mzML files that will be processed. For example, '../Users/Desktop/my_HRMS_files'.   - company: The type of mass spectrometer used to acquire the data. Valid options are 'Waters', 'Thermo', 'Sciex', and 'Agilent'.   - profile: A Boolean value that indicates whether the data is in profile or centroid mode. True for profile mode, False for centroid mode.   - processors: This setting determines the number of processors that will be used for data processing in parallel running. If the memory usage exceeds 90%, please note that some Excel files may not be generated.   - control_group (List[str]): A list of labels representing the control group.These labels are used in the search for relevant file names.   - filter_type (int): Determines the mode of operation.                           Set to 1 for data without triplicates; fold change is computed                           as the ratio of the sample area to the maximum control area.                           Set to 2 for data with triplicates; the function will calculate p-values,                           and fold change is computed as the ratio of the mean sample area                           to the mean control area.   - ms2_analysis: A Boolean value that indicates whether to perform DIA fragment analysis. Set to True to enable DIA fragment analysis, or False to disable it.   - area_threshold: The minimum peak area threshold. Peaks with an area below this threshold will be excluded from analysis.**The output file will have the suffix '_unique_cmps.xlsx' and will be structured as follows:**+--------------+-------+----------+-----------+--------+-------+----+| new_index    | rt    | mz       | intensity | S/N    | area  |... |+==============+=======+==========+===========+========+=======+====+| 15.48_241.05 | 15.5  | 241.0541 | 90817     | 1135.21| 53476 |... |+--------------+-------+----------+-----------+--------+-------+----+| 10.11_591.32 | 10.11 | 591.3243 | 78236     | 1738.58| 12272 |... |+--------------+-------+----------+-----------+--------+-------+----+| ...          |  ...  | ...      | ...       | ...    | ...   |... |+--------------+-------+----------+-----------+--------+-------+----+.. note::    If you have any questions about the column names in the output files, you can refer to the explanations provided below:   - **Inchikey:** Fixed-length format directly derived from International Chemical Identifier of a compound.   - **rt_error:** Retention time difference between observed retention time and recorded retention in database.   - **rt:** Retention time of a compound.   - **mz:** observed mass of a compound.   - **new_index:** a index after alignment for m/z &amp; retention pair.   - **MS2_spectra:** MS/MS spectra of compounds from DDA analysis (if available).   - **ms1_error:** mass difference between observed mass and theoretical mass (unit: part per million, i.e., ppm).   - **ms1_opt_error:** Mass difference between optimized mass and theoretical mass (For profile data only). The optimized mass was obtained by calculating the middle point for the full width at half the maximum of a mass peak.   - **frag_match_num:** Number for matched fragment.   - **match_info:** Information for matched fragments. For example: {344.1007: 0.0026, 372.0975: 0.0004} means two fragments were matched, i.e., 344.1007 and 372.0975 Da, and the mass error were 0.0026 and 0.0004 Da, respectively.   - **Source:** database source.   - **MS2 mode:** The fragments were obtained by DDA mode, DIA mode or both.   - **Smile:** Simplified molecular-input line-entry system.   - **CAS:** a unique identification number assigned by the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS).   - **name:** compound name.   - **formula:** compound formula.   - **Norman_SusDat_ID:** Norman suspect database ID.   - **Sites:** Sites for detected compounds in pearl river.   - **Confidence level:** Confidence level for structure identification.   - **Mode:** ESI mode for detected compounds. For example, {'pos': 17, 'neg': 40} means this compound were detected in 17 sampling sites in positive mode, while were detected in 40 sampling sites in negative mode.   - **sites_num:** number of sampling sites for detected compounds.   - **category:** category of detected compound.   - **usage:** usage of detected compound.   - **Lowest PNEC Freshwater [ug/l]:** Lowest predicted no-effect concentration in freshwater. These data were obtained from NORMAN ecotoxicology database.   - **conc(ng/L):** Concentration range for detected compounds.   - **frag_DIA:** This represents the fragment generated by analyzing data-independent acquisition (DIA) data.   - **iso_distribution:** This contains information about isotopes. For example, {591.3243: 1.0, 592.3254: 0.168} means that the m/z 591.3243 has a relative abundance of 100%, while 592.3254 has a relative abundance of 16.8%.   - **resolution:** This represents the resolution of the mass peak.   - **Ciso:** This is the potential carbon isotope peak. If the rt&amp;mz pair have a value in Ciso (e.g., '10.11_592.3254' has a value 'C13:10.11 _591.3243' in Ciso), it means that 10.11_592.3254 might be the C13 isotope peak of 10.11_591.3243.   - **Cliso and Briso:** These represent the potential chlorine and bromine isotope peaks, respectively. They work similarly to **Ciso**.   - **Na adducts and K adducts:** These represent the potential sodium and potassium adduct peaks, respectively. If the rt&amp;mz pair have a value in Na adducts (e.g., '9.99_598.2756' has a value 'Na adducts: 9.98 _576.2983' in Na adducts), it means that 9.99_598.2756 might be the sodium adduct of 9.98_576.2983. **K adducts** work similarly.   - **Sample_area_mean:** If duplicates/triplicates are available, this represents the average peak area for these samples.   - **Sample_area_std:** If duplicates/triplicates are available, this represents the standard error for these samples' peak areas.   - **p_value:** If triplicates are available, this represents the p-value when comparing the control set and sample set.   - **fold_change:** This represents the fold change value when comparing the peak area of the control set and sample set.   - **frag_DDA:** This represents the MS/MS spectra of compounds from data-dependent acquisition (DDA) analysis, if available.**1.2 Database matching*****************************************How to create a database using excel?* Here is an example template for an Excel database of compounds:+------------+------------+-----------------------+------------+-----------+------+-------+----------+--------------+| Inchikey   | Precursor  | Frag                  | Formula    | Smile     | Mode | RT    | Source   | Source info  |+============+============+=======================+============+===========+======+=======+==========+==============+| Inchikey1  | 211.1109   | [117.0459, 92.0506]   | C13H13N3   | smile1    | pos  | 15.36 | massbank | MoNA         |+------------+------------+-----------------------+------------+-----------+------+-------+----------+--------------+| Inchikey2  | 165.0425   | [135.0293, 135.0301]  | C11H14N4O5 | smile2    | neg  | 8.54  | massbank | MoNA         |+------------+------------+-----------------------+------------+-----------+------+-------+----------+--------------+| ...        | ...        | ...                   | ...        | ...       | ...  | ...   | ...      | ...          |+------------+------------+-----------------------+------------+-----------+------+-------+----------+--------------+.. note::      To build a local database, you will need to create an Excel file with information about the compounds you want to include in the database. It is important to note that you should not change the names of the columns in the Excel file, as they are used to map the information to the appropriate fields in the database.   - **Inchikey:** A fixed-length format derived from the International Chemical Identifier (InChI) of a compound. InChI is a standard way of representing chemical structures.   - **Precursor:** The monoisotopic mass of a compound, which is neutral and does not include any additional atoms that would result in a positive or negative charge.   - **Frag:** The fragments of a compound, represented as a list of values.

Any features with an area below this threshold will be removed from the result dataframe.**1.4 Single Result summarizing*****************************************The function is designed to collect identified features and ignore unidentified ones, resulting in a dataframe with the relevant information. In order to achieve this, the function requires three input dataframes: a suspect list from the Norman network, an ecotoxicity database from the Norman network, and a compound's category excel.When the function is used, it will extract the name, smile, CAS number, categories, and toxicity data for each identified feature. This information is then compiled into a new dataframe, which includes only the identified features and their associated data. By using this function, users can easily extract and organize the relevant information for identified features, without having to manually sift through large amounts of data... code-block:: python    df = pd.read_excel(r'../Users/Desktop/my_HRMS_files/sample_rt_ms2_match_filter.xlsx')    result_df = pms.summarize_results(df, db_category, suspect_list, db_toxicity)How to build a category database?* Here is an example template for an category database:+-----------------------------+------------+| Inchikey                    | category   |+=============================+============+| AAEJJSZYNKXKSW-UHFFFAOYSA-N | ['PFAS']   |+-----------------------------+------------+| AAIXLNBYXIVUKR-UHFFFAOYSA-N | ['PFAS']   |+-----------------------------+------------+| ...                         |['..','..'] |+-----------------------------+------------+.. note::   Parameters explanation:   - df: result dataframe   - db_category: category database   - suspect_list: suspect_list can be downloaded from `Norman suspect database &lt;http://www.norman-network.com/?q=node/236&gt;`_.   - db_toxicity: toxicity database can be downloaded from `Norman Ecotoxicology database &lt;https://www.norman-network.com/nds/ecotox/&gt;`_.**1.5 Combining Results from Samples with specific ESI Polarity***********************************************************************The function iterates through all result files with specific ESI polarity (positive or negative) and summarizes the results, generating a new Excel file that contains the summarized information... code-block:: python    path = r'../Users/Desktop/my_HRMS_files/summarized_result')    all_name_index = ['site01','site02','site03','site04',...]    mode = 'pos'    result_df = pms.summarized_results_concat(path, all_name_index, mode).. note::   Parameters explanation:   - path: the path to the folder containing the summarized result files.   - all_name_index: a list of unique identifiers that represent each sample set.   - mode: the ESI polarity of the samples ('pos' for positive or 'neg' for negative).**1.6 Combining results of pos &amp; neg***********************************************This function combined positive summarized result and negative summarized results into one final result... code-block:: python    all_df_pos = pms.summarized_results_concat(path_pos, all_name_index, 'pos')    all_df_neg = pms.summarized_results_concat(path_neg, all_name_index, 'neg')    result_df = pms.summarize_pos_neg_result(all_df_pos, all_df_neg).. note::   Parameters explanation:   - all_df_pos: summarized result of all positive files   - all_df_neg: summarized result of all negative filesNOTE*********************************************Please note that the documentation is currently a work in progress, and there is more content that is being written.

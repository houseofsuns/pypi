	<longdescription>[![MBARI](https://www.mbari.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/logo-mbari-3b.png)](http://www.mbari.org)[![semantic-release](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20%20%F0%9F%93%A6%F0%9F%9A%80-semantic--release-e10079.svg)](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-Python-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**DeepSeaAI** is a Python package to simplify processing deep sea video in [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) from a command line.  It includes reasonable defaults that have been optimized for deep sea video. The goal is to simplify running these algorithms in AWS.DeepSea-AI currently supports: - *Training [YOLOv5](http://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) object detection* models - *Processing video with [YOLOv5](http://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) detection and tracking pipeline using      * [StrongSort](https://github.com/mikel-brostrom/Yolov5_StrongSORT_OSNet) trackingThe cost to process a video is typically less than **$1.25** per 15-minute video.The cost to run the training algorithm depends on your data size and the number of GPUs you use.  A large collection with 30K images and 300K localizations may cost **$300-$600** to process.## Getting Started## InstallThere are two main requirements to use this:1.  [An account with AWS Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com).2.  [An account with Docker](http://docker.com).3.  Install and update using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/) in a Python&gt;=3.8.0 environment:After you have setup your AWS account, configure it using the awscli tool  ```pip install awscliaws configureaws --version```Then install the module```shellpip install -U deepsea-ai```Setting up the AWS environment is done with the setup mirror command.  This only needs to be done once, or when you upgradethe module.   This command will setup the appropriate AWS permissions and mirror the images used in the commandsfrom [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) to your ECR Elastic Container Registry. Be patient - this takes a while, but only needs to be run once.```shelldeepsea-ai setup --mirror```## Tutorials* [FathomNet](docs/notebooks/fathomnet_train.ipynb) ✨ Recommended first step to learn more about how to train a YOLOv5 object detection model using freely available FathomNet data### Create the Anaconda environmentThe fastest way to get started is to use the Anaconda environment.  This will create a conda environment called *deepsea-ai* and make that available in your local jupyter notebook as the kernel named *deepsea-ai*```shellconda env create conda activate deepsea-aipip install ipykernelpython -m ipykernel install --user --name=deepsea-ai```### Launch jupyter```cd docs/notebooksjupyter notebook```---## Commands* `deepsea-ai setup --help` - Setup the AWS environment. Must run this once before any other commands.* [`deepsea-ai train --help` - Train a YOLOv5 model and save the model to a bucket](docs/commands/train.md)* [`deepsea-ai process --help` - Process one or more videos and save the results to  a bucket](docs/commands/process.md)* [`deepsea-ai ecsprocess --help` - Process one or more videos using the Elastic Container Service and save the results to a bucket](docs/commands/process.md)* [`deepsea-ai split --help` - Split your training data. This is required before the train command.](docs/data.md) * [`deepsea-ai monitor --help` - Monitor processing. Use this after the ecsprocess train command.](docs/commands/monitor.md) * `deepsea-ai -h` - Print help message and exit. Source code is available at [github.com/mbari-org/deepsea-ai](https://github.com/mbari-org/deepsea-ai/).  For more details, see the [official documentation](http://docs.mbari.org/deepsea-ai/install).</longdescription>

	<longdescription># ScanEOScanEO is a Satellite collaborative annotation tool for Earth Observation.## InstructionsInstall ScanEO```pip install scaneo```Run the user interface```scaneo -d &lt;path_to_data&gt;```Open ScanEO in the provided URL ([http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/) by default) to start labeling your data.You can check the interactive documentation at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) (or the equivalent URL if you changed the port or host).You can see other options with ```scaneo --help```If your data is in a cloud bucket, you can work with it directly by providing the appropriate credentials.## AnnotationsYour annoatations will be stored as `GeoJSON` files with the same name of your images, followed by `_labels.geojson`. For example, if you are labeling `image1.tif`, your annotations will be stored in `image1_labels.geojson`. Additionally, a `labels.json` file will be created containing some metadata about your annotations.If your data folder contains a valid STAC `catalog.json`, ScanEO will work in STAC mode, using the [label extension](https://github.com/stac-extensions/label). STAC items will be created for each image (if not already present) and the annotations will be stored and linked as separate assets.## ContactScanEO is developed by [Earthpulse](https://earthpulse.ai/).

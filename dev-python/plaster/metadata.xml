Itexists to define a common API for applications to use when they wish to loadconfiguration. The library itself does not aim to handle anything excepta basic API that applications may use to find and load configuration settings.Any specific constraints should be implemented in a pluggable loader which canbe registered via an entrypoint.See https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/plaster/en/latest/ or``docs/index.rst`` in this distribution for detailed documentation.1.1.2 (2022-11-20)==================- Fix a bug in which plaster would crash harder than expected if a URI  is specified to a distribution that does not have the specified entry points.  Now a LoaderNotFound exception will be raised instead of a bad unpacking  of tuples.1.1.1 (2022-11-20)==================- Add support for Python 3.11.- Fix an bug introduced in 1.1 on some systems where  ``plaster.exceptions.MultipleLoadersFound`` would be raised due to  ``lib`` and ``lib64`` being symlinked to each other and both added to the  ``sys.path``.  See https://github.com/Pylons/plaster/pull/271.1 (2022-10-06)================- Drop support for Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6.- Add support for Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10.- Drop runtime dependency on setuptools / pkg_resources by switching to  ``importlib.metadata``.1.0 (2017-10-11)================- Improve the exception message for ``InvalidURI`` to show the ``config_uri``.  See https://github.com/Pylons/plaster/pull/170.5 (2017-06-02)================- When a scheme is not supplied, ``plaster.parse_uri`` will now autogenerate  a scheme from the file extension with the format ``file+&lt;ext&gt;`` instead of  simply ``&lt;ext&gt;`` (for example, ``file+ini`` instead of ``ini``).  See https://github.com/Pylons/plaster/pull/16- Absolute lookups are now pulled from the start of the scheme instead of  the end. This means that if you want to explicitly define the package that  the loader is pulled from, use ``package+scheme`` instead of  ``scheme+package``.  See https://github.com/Pylons/plaster/pull/160.4 (2017-03-30)================- Removed the ``plaster.NoSectionError`` exception. It's expected that  individual loaders should return an empty dictionary of settings in the  case that a section cannot be found.  See https://github.com/Pylons/plaster/pull/12- Expect the ``wsgi`` protocol to raise ``LookupError`` exceptions when  a named wsgi component cannot be found.  See https://github.com/Pylons/plaster/pull/120.3 (2017-03-27)================- Lookup now works differently. First &quot;foo+bar&quot; looks for an installed project  distribution named &quot;bar&quot; with a loader named &quot;foo&quot;. If this fails then it  looks for any loader named &quot;foo+bar&quot;.- Rename the loader entry point to ``plaster.loader_factory``.- Add the concept of protocols to ``plaster.get_loader`` and  ``plaster.find_loaders``.- ``plaster.find_loaders`` now works on just schemes and protocols  instead of full ``PlasterURL`` objects and implements the lookup  algorithm for finding loader factories.- Change the ``ILoaderInfo`` interface to avoid being coupled to a  particular uri. ``ILoaderInfo.load`` now takes a ``config_uri``  parameter.- Add a ``options`` dictionary to ``PlasterURL`` containing any arguments  decoded from the query string. Loaders may use these for whatever they wish  but one good option is default values in a config file.- Define the ``IWSGIProtocol`` interface which addons can use to implement  a loader that can return full wsgi apps, servers and filters.- The scheme is now case-insensitive.0.2 (2016-06-15)================- Allow ``config_uri`` syntax ``scheme:path`` alongside ``scheme://path``.  See https://github.com/Pylons/plaster/issues/3- Improve errors to show the user-supplied values in the error message.  See https://github.com/Pylons/plaster/pull/4- Add ``plaster.find_loaders`` which can be used by people who need a way  to recover when ambiguous loaders are discovered via ``plaster.get_loader``.  See https://github.com/Pylons/plaster/pull/5- Rename ``plaster.Loader`` to ``plaster.ILoader`` to signify its purpose  as an interface with no actual implementation.  See https://github.com/Pylons/plaster/pull/5- Introduce ``plaster.ILoaderFactory`` to document what the entry point targets  are expected to implement.  See https://github.com/Pylons/plaster/pull/50.1 (2016-06-12)================- Initial release.</longdescription>

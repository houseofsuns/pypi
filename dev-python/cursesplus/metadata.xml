	<longdescription># Curses PlusExtension library to curses## How To InstallUse ```pip3 install cursesplus```on Linux or ```py -m pip install cursesplus```on Windows### SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR WINDOWSFor Windows you need to also install ```windows-curses``` or related programto provide the basic curses functionality## What's New?## Patch 2.11.6- Add CheckBoxItem- Use to create more customized checkboxlists## Patch 2.11.5- Messagebox now has nicer titles- coloured_option_menu is now more lax## Version 2.11- Add checkboxlist- Choose one or more options from the list- Add banned characters in cursesinput.- Fix blinking in textview# Documentation## transitions.pytransitions contains many transitions to add animations to your program### _old(stdscr,func_to_call=None,args=(),type=0)This is the old transitions function found in cursesplus prior to like 2.8 or something. It has since been replaced by horizontal_bars() and random_blocks()- `stdscr` is a curses window object- `func_to_call` is a function. If it is set to none, no function is called- `args` is a tuple. The tuple will be passed to the function as arguments- `type` is an int. It may be 0 or 1. If it is 0, there are horizontal bars. If it is 1, it is random blocks### __exec(func,args)**NOTE: THIS IS AN INTERNAL FUNCTION, IT IS NOT MEANT TO BE USED BY THE COMMON USER**This executes `func(args)`### horizontal_bars(stdscr,func_to_call=None,args=(),speed=1)This is a replacement function to old's type zero. It fills the screen from the top down with horizontal white bars. It then replaces them with black bars in the same configuration.- `stdscr` is a curses window object- `func_to_call` is a function. If it is set to none, no function is called- `args` is a tuple. The tuple will be passed to the function as arguments- `speed` is an int. A higher value increases the animation speed. A lower value (0 - 1) makes it slower. If you set speed to 0, the program will crash.### random_blocks(stdscr,func_to_call=None,args=(),speed=1)This is a replacement for old's type one transition. It fills random characters of the screen with blocks until the whole screen is covered, then it removes it in the same fashion.- `stdscr` is a curses window object- `func_to_call` is a function. If it is set to none, no function is called- `args` is a tuple. The tuple will be passed to the function as arguments- `speed` is an int. A higher value increases the animation speed. A lower value (0 - 1) makes it slower. If you set speed to 0, the program will crash.### vertical_bars(stdscr,func_to_call=None,args=(),speed=1)This is an all new transition. It functions like horizontal bars except they are vertical and go left to right.- `stdscr` is a curses window object- `func_to_call` is a function. If it is set to none, no function is called- `args` is a tuple. The tuple will be passed to the function as arguments- `speed` is an int. A higher value increases the animation speed. A lower value (0 - 1) makes it slower. If you set speed to 0, the program will crash.</longdescription>

	<longdescription>Harbormaster============Do you have apps you want to deploy to a server, but Kubernetes is way too much?Harbormaster is for you.Harbormaster is a small and simple container orchestrator that lets you easily deploymultiple Docker-Compose applications on a single host.It does this by taking a list of git repository URLs that contain DockerCompose files and running the Compose apps they contain. It will also handleupdating/restarting the apps when the repositories change.Please [visit the documentation](https://harbormaster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) formore details.## RationaleDo you have a home server you want to run a few apps on, but don't want everything tobreak every time you upgrade the OS? Do you want automatic updates but don't want to buyan extra 4 servers so you can run Kubernetes?Do you have a work server that you want to run a few small services on, but don't wantto have to manually manage it? Do you find that having every deployment action be ina git repo more tidy?Harbormaster is for you.At its core, Harbormaster takes a YAML config file with a list of git repository URLscontaining Docker Compose files, clones/pulls them, and starts the services theydescribe.You run Harbormaster on a timer, pointing it to a directory, and it updates all therepositories in its configuration, and restarts the Compose services if they havechanged. That's it!It also cleanly stores data for all apps in a single `data/` directory, so you alwayshave one directory that holds all the state, which you can easily back up and restore.See more details in [the documentation](https://harbormaster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).# Changelog## v0.3.4 (2023-07-31)### Features* Add the `HM_` vars to the environment so they can be used in Compose v2 files.

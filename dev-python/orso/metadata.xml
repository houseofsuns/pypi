	<longdescription>&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;![Orso](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mabel-dev/orso/main/orso.png)**Orso is a shared DataFrame library for [Opteryx](https://opteryx.dev/), [Mabel](https://github.com/mabel-dev/mabel) and [HadroDB](https://github.com/mabel-dev/hadrodb).**[![PyPI Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/orso.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/orso/)[![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/orso)](https://pepy.tech/project/orso)[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/mabel-dev/orso/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=nl9JwOVdPs)](https://codecov.io/gh/mabel-dev/orso)[![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/Documentation-018EF5?logo=ReadMe&amp;logoColor=fff&amp;style=flat)](https://opteryx.dev/latest/get-started/ecosystem/orso/)&lt;/div&gt;Orso is not intended to compete with [Polars](https://www.pola.rs/) or [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) (or your favorite ~~bear~~ DataFrame technology), instead it is developed as a common layer for HadroDB and Opteryx.In Opteryx, Orso provides most of the database Cursor functionality.In Mabel, Orso provides the data schema and validation functionality, and the intention is to use as the WAL.In HadroDB, Orso provides functionality for handling datasets.Orso DataFrames are row-based, this is driven by it's initial target use-case as the WAL for Mabel - if you want to convert to a columnar store, it's pretty quick at converting to an Arrow Table... converting from an Arrow Table is included for completeness only.Each row in an Orso Dataframe is able to be be quickly converted to a Tuple of values, a Dictionary or to a byte representation.## License[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://github.com/mabel-dev/orso/blob/master/LICENSE)Orso is licensed under Apache 2.0 unless explicitly indicated otherwise.## Status[![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-beta-orange)](https://github.com/mabel-dev/orso)Orso is in beta. Beta means different things to different people, to us, being beta means:- Interfaces are generally stable but may still have breaking changes- Unit test are not reliable enough to capture breaks to functionality- Bugs are likely to exist in edge cases- Code may not be tuned for performanceAs such, we really don't recommend using Orso in critical applications.</longdescription>

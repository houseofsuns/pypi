If you're looking for a tool that can detect your application's dependenciesand assess them for vulnerabilities against the OSS Index, perhaps you should check out [Jake](https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/jake).You can of course use this library in your own applications.## InstallationInstall from pypi.org as you would any other Python module:```pip install ossindex-lib```## UsageFirst create an instance of `OssIndex`, optionally enabling local caching```o = OssIndex()```Then supply a `List` of [PackageURL](https://github.com/package-url/packageurl-python) objects that you want to askOSS Index about. If you don't want to care about generating this list yourself, perhaps look to a tool like [Jake](https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/jake)(which uses this library) and will do all the hard work for you!As a quick test, you could run:```o = OssIndex()results: List[OssIndexComponent] = o.get_component_report(packages=[    PackageURL.from_string(purl='pkg:pypi/pip@19.2.0')])for r in results:    print(&quot;{}: {} known vulnerabilities&quot;.format(r.get_coordinates(), len(r.get_vulnerabilities())))    v: Vulnerability    for v in r.get_vulnerabilities():        print('    - {}'.format(str(v)))```... which would output something like ...```pkg:pypi/pip@19.2.0: 1 known vulnerabilities    - &lt;Vulnerability id=e4c955a3-2004-472e-920b-783fea46c3cd, name=OSSINDEX-783f-ea46-c3cd, cvss_score=3.6&gt;```## LoggingThis library send log events to a standard Python `logger` named `ossindex`. You can configure the logger to output asrequired through the standard [Python logging configuration](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.config.html).## Todos1. Support authentication against OSS Index## Python SupportWe endeavour to support all functionality for all [current actively supported Python versions](https://www.python.org/downloads/).However, some features may not be possible/present in older Python versions due to their lack of support.## ChangelogSee our [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md).## The Fine PrintRemember:It is worth noting that this is **NOT SUPPORTED** by Sonatype, and is a contribution of ours to the open sourcecommunity (read: you!)* Use this contribution at the risk tolerance that you have* Do NOT file Sonatype support tickets related to `ossindex-lib`* DO file issues here on GitHub, so that the community can pitch inPhew, that was easier than I thought. Last but not least of all - have fun!</longdescription>

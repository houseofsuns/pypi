	<longdescription># Django 2FA using Twilio Verify## Prerequisites* Python 3.6+* [Twilio](https://twilio.com) account* `django` 2.29+* `twilio` 7.8.2+* `phonenumbers` 8.12.26+## InstallationInstall using `pip install django-twilio-2fa`.If install fails, try `pip install --upgrade pip`Add to your `INSTALLED_APPS`:```pythonINSTALLED_APPS = (    ...    &quot;django_twilio_2fa&quot;,    &quot;django_widget_tweaks&quot;,  # only required if using included templates    ...)```Add the project `urls.py`:```pythonurlpatterns = [    ...    # View-based 2FA    path(        &quot;2fa/&quot;,  # Can be changed to any path        include(&quot;django_twilio_2fa.urls&quot;)    ),    # API-based 2FA    path(        &quot;2fa-api/&quot;,  # Can be changed to any path        include(&quot;django_twilio_2fa.api.urls&quot;)    ),    ...]```## Other Pages* [View-based 2FA Flow](docs/view_flow.md)* [Settings](docs/settings.md)* [Errors](docs/errors.md)## SignalsSignal names are prefixed `twilio_2fa_`.All signals are sent with at least the following arguments:* `request`: Current `Request` instance or `None`* `user`: `User` instance or `None`### `twilio_error`When the Twilio client throws an error, this signal is emitted -- whether the error was handled. This is a special signal that only provides the exception instance as `exc` and no other arguments.### `set_user_data`When a user registers or changes their 2FA data, this signal is emitted the updated information and should be used to update the user's instance.Additional arguments sent with this signal: * `field`: field name (`phone_number` is the only option) * `value`: updated value### `verification_sent`This signal is triggered anytime a verification is sent. Additional arguments sent with this signal:* `method`: Verification method* `verification_sid`: Twilio SID for verification* `start_timestamp`: `DateTime` of the original send* `last_timestamp`: `DateTime` of the last send attempt### `verification_success`This signal is triggered when a user completes verification successfully.The `verification_status_changed` signal is also triggered during a successful verification.Additional arguments sent with this signal:* `verification_sid`: Twilio verification SID### `verification_status_changed`This signal is triggered when the Twilio verification status is changed. Options for `status`: `approved` and `canceled`.Additional arguments sent with this signal:* `status`: Status verification was changed to* `verification_sid`: Twilio verification SID### `verification_failed`This signal is triggered when the Twilio verification attempt has failed.Additional arguments sent with this signal:* `verification_sid`: Twilio verification SID## CustomizationThe presentation code uses [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/), [Font Awesome 5](https://fontawesome.com/v5/search), and [django-widget-tweaks](https://github.com/jazzband/django-widget-tweaks). None are an absolute requirement and can be removed using custom templates or, in the case of Font Awesome, defining the `METHOD_DISPLAY_CB` setting.All templates are in the `twilio_2fa` directory. To override these templates, you can put your version in your own `twilio_2fa` directory anywhere your templates are stored.&lt;img src=&quot;docs/assets/customization-diagram.png&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;### `_base.html`This is the primary template that all main templates extends.It defines a single block for content: `content` (outlined in yellow above). For `django_widget_tweaks`, the `content` block is wrapped by `WIDGET_ERROR_CLASS`.The header can also be changed using the `header` block (outlined in red). Header icon classes changed using the `header_icon_class` block (outlined in blue) and text changed using the `header_text` block (outlined in green). ### `_messages.html`This template shows messages from `django.contrib.messages` and is included in each of the main templates.### `_form_errors.html`This template displays a form field's errors. `field` should be passed in the context.### `failed.html`This template is shown when the user's verification failed either from a timeout of the verification, maximum tries are exceeded, an API failure with Twilio, or other general error.It conditionally allows users to retry verification based on the `can_retry` session variable.### `registration_form.html`This template shows the registration form to the user and serves as the base template for `register.html` and `change.html`. ### `register.html`This template shows the registration form to the user.If `ALLOW_REGISTRATION` is `False`, the user is not shown this view and will be redirected to the failure page if no phone number is returned by `PHONE_NUMBER_CB`.It is based on `registration_form.html`.### `change.html`This template shows the change form to the user.It is based on `registration_form.html`.### `start.html`This template allows the user to select the verification method.If only one method exists, the user will not see this page.### `success.html`This template is shown on a successful verification if `VERIFY_SUCCESS_URL` is not set.### `verify.html`This template shows the token form.## DevelopmentPerform the following steps in the root directory:1. Create a virtual environment and activate.2. Install `django_twilio_2fa`: `pip install -e .`Perform the following steps in the `test_app` directory:3. Update path to this package in the requirements.txt4. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.5. Copy `.env-sample` to `.env` and update with your twilio settings.6. Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate`.7. Run the server: `python manage.py runserver`.The test app should now be available at http://localtest.me:8000.To run tests, run `python manage.py test` from the `test_app` directory.### To-Do* ~~Internationalization~~* [~~E-mail verification~~](https://www.twilio.com/docs/verify/email)* WhatsApp integration* [TOTP integration](https://www.twilio.com/docs/verify/quickstarts/totp)* [Push for web integration](https://www.twilio.com/docs/verify/quickstarts/push-web)* ~~Abstraction for 2FA outside of web flow~~### Changelog* 0.32 - bug fixes for lost users* 0.31 - minor fix of `error_displays` setting* 0.30 - added more messages for user displays; updated view-based templates to use messages; added `display` key to API-based responses* 0.29 - downgraded requirements for inclusivity* 0.28 - added better customization of user messaging* 0.27 - allow sending verifications to different values; set default status code for errors to 400* 0.26 - added handling of Twilio Error 60200* 0.25 - bug fix for handling unauthenticated users* 0.24 - refactored to abstract process; added API endpoints; allow for userless 2FA* 0.23 - Twilio rate limiting error handling* 0.22 - Added internationalization and e-mail verification (thanks to [jgoodsell-summitgrp](https://github.com/jgoodsell-summitgrp))</longdescription>

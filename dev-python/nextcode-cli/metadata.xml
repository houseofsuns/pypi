We recommend trying to install it into your system python in `develop` mode by simply running the following command in the nextcode-cli folder (depending on your system setup you might need `sudo`)```bash$ pip3 install -e .```If you get any errors you can set up a local virtualenv in the nextcode-cli path:```bash$ source ./setup.sh$ pip3 install -e .```Using this method means that you will always need to do `source ./setup.sh` to enter the virtualenv before using the tool, so we would recommend getting the first method to work unless you intend on make edits to the code yourself.## Set up a service profile### Create a service profileFor any work to happen a service profile must be defined. One example is the one here below, which is Platform Dev test specific. For QA purposes this is of course **test environment dependent**!:The command is:```bash$ nextcode profile add &lt;profile-name&gt;```Follow the prompts to enter a server name and then log in through the browser window that opens up.You can also set up the profile without a prompt like this:```bash$ nextcode profile add &lt;profile-name&gt; --domain=mydomain.wuxinextcode.com --api-key=&lt;key&gt;```### Running the CLI for the first timeOnce your installation has succeeded you can run the following command anywhere in your system:```bashnextcode status```Once you finish the authentication process you should be able to view workflow jobs:```bashnextcode workflow jobs```To start familiarizing yourself with the sdk you can use the --help option on all commands to see detailed information about their use.```bash$ nextcode --helpUsage: nextcode [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...  A utility for interfacing with WuXi Nextcode services.  This tool allows you to communicate with the pipelines service, CSA,  workflow service and GOR Query API. For all usage you will need to  authenticate against the specific service profile you are using.  Please look at the subcommands below for details.Options:  -v, --verbose [warning|error|info]                                  Output logs for debugging  -p, --profile TEXT              Use a specific profile for this command  --help                          Show this message and exit.Commands:  csa_authenticate  Authenticate against CSA (for import).  import            Import a TSV manifest into CSA.  keycloak          Manage keycloak users Requires the keycloak admin...  login             Authenticate against keycloak.  pipelines         Root subcommand for pipelines functionality  profile           Configure server profile to use.  query             Root subcommand for query api functionality  token             Print out an access token for the current profile  version           Show the Nextcode CLI version.  workflow          Root subcommand for workflow functionality$ nextcode workflow --helpUsage: nextcode workflow [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

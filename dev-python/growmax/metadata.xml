Checks the low water level sensor before invoking the pumps.* `WATER_SENSOR_LOW` Defaults `22`.  Which GPIO port has the Optomax water level sensor for low levels?  Supported `growmax` board ports are 21 and 22 * Much more:[Complete and latest default config](https://github.com/opensensor/growmax/blob/main/src/growmax/config.py)# VerificationTest the routine by running the created ``main.py`` in Thonny IDE.  You should see output in the terminal and the program should not have any errors.Once you have verified the pico runs the code properly, your device is now plug and play ready.  Simply supply 5V USB voltage by plugging the pico growmax board into a common USB wall wart and the pico will boot the ``main`` routine.# Power and SafetyThe ``growmax`` is designed with the pico power requirements in mind.   When modifying the application logic, it is important to realize:* Pico max current is ~300 mA; when using the onboard pump ports and mosfets: ensure the pumps you source are 5V and draw less than 200 mA.* Should you need to control higher powered pumps and equipment, it is recommended to pair with an I2C relay board for such use cases.* The pico operates at 3.3V logic levels, however the pumps and water sensor ports are powered by the 5V VSYS.  * The water sensor ports are designed for the Optomax liquid sensor and have voltage dividers for an expected 4V -&gt; 3.3V input back to the pico.

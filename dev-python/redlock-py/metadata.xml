	<longdescription>redlock-py - Redis distributed locks in PythonThis python lib implements the Redis-based distributed lock manager algorithm[described in this blog post](http://antirez.com/news/77).To create a lock manager:    dlm = Redlock([{&quot;host&quot;: &quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;port&quot;: 6379, &quot;db&quot;: 0}, ])To acquire a lock:    my_lock = dlm.lock(&quot;my_resource_name&quot;,1000)Where the resource name is an unique identifier of what you are trying to lockand 1000 is the number of milliseconds for the validity time.The returned value is `False` if the lock was not acquired (you may try again),otherwise an namedtuple representing the lock is returned, having three fields:* validity, an integer representing the number of milliseconds the lock will be valid.* resource, the name of the locked resource as specified by the user.* key, a random value which is used to safe reclaim the lock.To release a lock:    dlm.unlock(my_lock)It is possible to setup the number of retries (by default 3) and the retrydelay (by default 200 milliseconds) used to acquire the lock.**Disclaimer**: This code implements an algorithm which is currently a proposal,it was not formally analyzed.

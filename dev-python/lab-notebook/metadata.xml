	<longdescription>.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/lobachevzky/lab-notebook.svg?branch=master    :target: https://travis-ci.org/lobachevzky/lab-notebook    Lab Notebook============Researchers in computer science often need to compare results between different versions of a process.``Lab Notebook`` helps document, track, and organize process these kinds of runs.This is essential for reproducibility and helps researchers figure out what changes in code led to different outcomes.The goals of ``Lab Notebook`` are reproducibility, modularity, and organization.Specifically, ``Lab Notebook`` provides the following functionality:* Maintain metadata about each run, including a description, a timestamp, and a git commit.* Automatically set up runs, building flags and directories with unique name corresponding to each run and launching runs in tmux.* Organize runs into hierarchical categories.* Synchronize runs with directories, so that directories are moved and deleted when runs are moved and deleted.Installation------------The only external dependencies of this tool are ``tmux`` and ``git``. After that, ``pip install lab-notebook``.Configuration-------------The program will default to any arguments specified in ``.runsrc``.The user can always override the ``.runsrc`` file with command-line arguments.For descriptions of arguments, use ``runs -h`` or ``runs [command] -h``The program searches for the ``.runsrc`` file in ancestors (inclusive) of the current working directory.If the program does not find a ``.runsrc`` file, it will create one with default values in the current working directory.The user can use two keyword in the ``.runsrc``:* ``&lt;path&gt;`` will be replaced by the *path* to the run. Paths look just like ordinary file paths (``/``-delimited).* ``&lt;name&gt;`` will be replaced by the head of *path*.Also users can interpolate strings from other sections of ``.runsrc`` using the syntax ``${section:value}``.For more details see`configparser ExtendedInterpolation &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#configparser.ExtendedInterpolation&gt;`_.Here is an example ``.runsrc`` file:.. code-block:: ini    [main]    root = /Users/ethan/demo-lab-notebook/.runs    db_path = /Users/ethan/demo-lab-notebook/runs.pkl    dir_names = tensorboard    prefix = Source ~/virtualenvs/demo-lab-notebook/bin/activate;    nice    [flags]    --log-dir=${main:root}/tensorboard/&lt;path&gt;    [new]    description = demo lab-notebookThis will pass the flag ``--logdir=/Users/ethan/baselines/.runs/tensorboard/&lt;path&gt;``to any program launched with ``run``, where ``&lt;path&gt;`` will be replaced by the ``path`` argument given by the user.``runs-git``------------This is a simple wrapper around ``git`` that substitutes ``+your-path`` with ``runs lookup commit your-path``.For example, to see changes since when you launched ``your-run``:.. code-block:: console  runs-git diff +your-runIf you want to live on the wild side, use `direnv &lt;https://direnv.net/&gt;`_ to alias ``git`` to ``runs-git`` when youare in your project directory.Example Usage-------------Setup environment:.. code-block:: console  mkdir ~/lab-notebook-demo/ &amp;&amp; cd ~/lab-notebook-demo  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/mnist/mnist_with_summaries.py  pip install tensorflow lab-notebook  git init  echo 'runs.pkl .runs .runsrc' &gt; .gitignore  git add -A  git commit -am initCreate a new run. The run will be launched in ``tmux``:.. code-block:: console  runs new train 'python mnist_with_summaries.py' --description='demo new command'Check out your run:.. code-block:: console  tmux attach -t trainReproduce your run:.. code-block:: console  runs reproduce train  runs reproduce --no-overwrite trainTry modifying the ``.runsrc`` file to look like the example in the`Configuration`_ section with appropriate changes for your system.Then create a new run:.. code-block:: console  runs new subdir/train 'python mnist_with_summaries.py' --description='demo categorization'Get an overview of what runs are in the database:.. code-block:: console  runs ls  runs ls 'tra*'  runs ls --show-attrsQuery information about current runs:.. code-block:: console  runs lookup description train  runs lookup commit train``runs-git``: avoid typing ``runs lookup commit &lt;path&gt;`` all the time:.. code-block:: console  echo '# Hello' &gt;&gt; mnist_with_summaries.py  runs-git diff +trainOrganize runs.. code-block:: console  runs mv train subdir/train2  runs ls  tree .runs  # note that directories are synchronized with database entries  runs mv subdir archive  runs lsDelete runs.. code-block:: console  runs rm archive/train  runs killallSubcommands-----------For an overview of subcommands, run.. code-block:: console  runs -hFor detailed descriptions of each subcommand and its arguments, run.. code-block:: console  runs &lt;subcommand&gt; -hTab autocompletion------------------If you are using Zsh, simpy copy the ``_runs`` to some place on your ``fpath``.Then pressing tab will prompt you with the names of runs currently in yourdatabaseWhy not just use git?---------------------* If processes are long-running, it is hard to know which commit a given run corresponds to.* Commit statements are really meant to describe *changes* to software, not *runs*. A description of a change may not actually tell you very much about the motivation for a software run.* Not all commits will correspond to runs, so you will need to fish through a large number of commits to find those that correspond to runs.* Often processes depend on specific file-structures (e.g. a logging directory). Setting up and removing these directories by hand is time-consuming and error-prone.* Commits cannot be organized hierarchically or categorized after their creation.</longdescription>

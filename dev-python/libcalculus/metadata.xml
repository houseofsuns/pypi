	<longdescription># libcalculus: A comprehensive real and complex analysis library for Python[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/ariter777/libcalculus/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/ariter777/libcalculus/commits/master)libcalculus is fully written in C++ and Cython for bindings to Python; all numeric calculations take place in C++ and take full advantage of SIMD vectorization and OpenMP threading wherever available.## Features- Functional programming approach to analysis in Python- Numeric integration and differentiation of real and complex functions- Full integration with NumPy: functions support array inputs- LaTeX support: every function object has a `.latex()` that produces its LaTeX markup## Technologylibcalculus is written in C\+\+20 and bound to Python via Cython; operations between functions are performed using C++ lambdas, and all calculations happen at the C++ level, with Python only interfacing methods and results.## Installationlibcalculus can be installed from pip:```pip install libcalculus```## ExamplesHere is a snippet demonstrating some of the library's features:```python&gt;&gt;&gt; import libcalculus, numpy as np&gt;&gt;&gt; f = libcalculus.csc @ (1 / libcalculus.identity) # csc(1 / z)&gt;&gt;&gt; f(1 + 2j)(1.0316491868272164+1.9336686363989997j)&gt;&gt;&gt; libcalculus.residue(f, 0, tol=1e-4)(0.16666666639893526-8.181230860681676e-06j)&gt;&gt;&gt; print(f.latex(&quot;z&quot;))\csc\left( \frac{1}{z}\right)&gt;&gt;&gt; contour = libcalculus.line(2, 1 + 1j) # 2(1 - t) + (1 + 1i)t&gt;&gt;&gt; libcalculus.integrate(f, contour, 0, 1) # integrate along the contour between t=0 and t=1(-2.0551412843830605+1.1351565349386723j)&gt;&gt;&gt; libcalculus.threads(4) # Enable threading&gt;&gt;&gt; arr = np.array([[1, 2j, 3], [4 + 1j, 5 + 2j, 7 + 3j]])&gt;&gt;&gt; print(f(arr))[[ 1.18839511+0.j         -0.        +1.91903475j  3.05628425+0.j        ] [ 4.03942207+0.99000843j  5.02878731+1.98839211j  7.02013025+2.99133798j]]```## Source BuildBuilding from source can be beneficial when looking to tailor optimizations to one's specific CPU architecture or so as to modify source code privately.This can be done easily with the proper required libraries - Boost, Cython and NumPy.### LinuxA convenient driver script for compilation with different options, testing etc. is available on Linux.```bash$ git clone https://gitlab.com/ariter777/libcalculus &amp;&amp; cd libcalculus$ ./run.sh --debug build test # Run with -h (or without any flags) for help```Extra compiler and linker flags can be provided with the `CXXFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` environment variables.### WindowsOn Windows you will need to run the individual scripts separately; `setup.py` for building, and `test.py` for testing.```batch&gt; git clone https://gitlab.com/ariter777/libcalculus &amp;&amp; cd libcalculus&gt; python setup.py build_ext --inplace&gt; python test.py --Function --RealFunction --Contour --ComplexFunction```## LicenseCopyright (c) 2022, Ariel TerkeltoubAll rights reserved.Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or withoutmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions aremet:    * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright       notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.    * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above       copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following       disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided       with the distribution.    * Neither the name of the libcalculus developers nor the names of any       contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived       from this software without specific prior written permission.THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS&quot;AS IS&quot; AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOTLIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FORA PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

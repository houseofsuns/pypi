Red line numbers indicate breakpoints, if any.- **Globals** and **Locals** boxes show local and global variables in the current scope.  Special variables that start and end with double underscores ``__`` are excluded  (you can always view them using PDB commands).- Human-readable Unicode literals for Python 2.- Command history that stores up to 10 last unique PDB commands (accessed by arrow UP/DOWN keys)... figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/romanvm/python-web-pdb/master/screenshot.png  :alt: Web-PDB screenshot  :width: 640px  :height: 490px  *Web-PDB console in Chrome browser*Usage=====Install Web-PDB into your working Python environment::  pip install web-pdbInsert the following line into your Python program at the point where you wantto start debugging:.. code-block:: python  import web_pdb; web_pdb.set_trace()The ``set_trace()`` call will suspend your program and open a web-UI at the default port ``5555``(port value can be changed). Enter in your browser's address bar:``http://&lt;your Python machine hostname or IP&gt;:5555``,for example ``http://monty-python:5555``,and you should see the web-UI like the one on the preceding screenshot.Now you can use all PDB commands and features. Additional **Current file**, **Globals**and **Locals** information boxes help you better track your program runtime state.**Note**: it is strongly recommended to work with the Web-PDB web-UI only in one browser session.With more than one browser window accessing the web-UI it may display incorrect data in one or morebrowser sessions.Subsequent ``set_trace()`` calls can be used as hardcoded breakpoints.Web-PDB is compatible with the new `breakpoint()`_ function added in Python 3.7.Set environment variable ``PYTHONBREAKPOINT=&quot;web_pdb.set_trace&quot;`` to launch Web-PDBwith ``breakpoint()``.Additionally, Web-PDB provides ``catch_post_mortem`` context manager that can catchunhandled exceptions raised within its scope and automatically start PDB post-mortem debugging session.For example:.. code-block:: python  import web_pdb  with web_pdb.catch_post_mortem():      # Some error-prone code      assert foo == bar, 'Oops!'For more detailed info about the Web-PDB API read docstrings in the ``./web_pdb/__init__.py`` file.The ``inspect`` Command-----------------------Web-PDB provides ``inspect`` or ``i`` command that is not present in the original PDB.This command outputs the list of object's members along with their values.Syntax: ``inspect &lt;object_name&gt;`` or ``i &lt;object_name&gt;``.Special members with names enclosed in double underscores (``__``) are ignored.Considerations for Multithreading and Multiprocessing Programs==============================================================Multithreading--------------Web-PDB maintains one debugger instance that traces only one thread. You should not call ``set_trace()``from different threads to avoid race conditions. Each thread needs to be debugged separately one at a time.Multiprocessing---------------Each process can have its own debugger instance provided you call ``set_trace`` with a different port valuefor each process. This way you can debug each process in a separate browser tab/window.To simplify this you can use ``set_trace(port=-1)`` to select a random port between 32768 and 65536.Compatibility=============- **Python**: 2.7, 3+- **Browsers**: Firefox, Chrome (all modern browsers should work)License=======MIT, see ``LICENSE.txt``.The debugger icon made by `Freepik`_ from `www.flaticon.com`_ is licensed by `CC 3.0 BY`_... _PDB: https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/pdb.html.. _Bootstrap: http://getbootstrap.com.. _Prism: http://prismjs.com/.. _Freepik: http://www.freepik.com.. _www.flaticon.com: http://www.flaticon.com.. _CC 3.0 BY: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/.. _breakpoint(): https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#breakpointChangelog#########v.1.5.7=======* Updated frontend dependencies.v.1.5.6* Fixed the issue when a local variable could not be assigned from the debugger console.* Updated frontend dependencies.v.1.5.3* Fixed the issue with closed debugger still being stored in ``active_instance``  class property that prevented starting a new debugger session (thanks to **maiamcc**).v.1.5.2=======* Updated frontend dependencies.v.1.5.1=======* Fixed using ``inspect`` command for variables with ``None`` values.v.1.5.0=======* Added ``inspect`` command.v.1.4.4=======* Upgrade Prism.js to v.1.15.0v.1.4.3=======* Use gzip compression instead of deflate for web-console endpoints  (`more info &lt;https://stackoverflow.com/a/9856879/4819775&gt;`_).v.1.4.2=======* Bump ``asyncore-wsgi`` dependency version.

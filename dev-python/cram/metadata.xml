	<longdescription>====================== Cram: It's test time======================Cram is a functional testing framework for command line applications.Cram tests look like snippets of interactive shell sessions. Cram runseach command and compares the command output in the test with thecommand's actual output.Here's a snippet from `Cram's own test suite`_::    The $PYTHON environment variable should be set when running this test    from Python.      $ [ -n &quot;$PYTHON&quot; ] || PYTHON=&quot;`which python`&quot;      $ [ -n &quot;$PYTHONPATH&quot; ] || PYTHONPATH=&quot;$TESTDIR/..&quot; &amp;&amp; export PYTHONPATH      $ if [ -n &quot;$COVERAGE&quot; ]; then      &gt;   coverage erase      &gt;   alias cram=&quot;`which coverage` run --branch -a $TESTDIR/../scripts/cram&quot;      &gt; else      &gt;   alias cram=&quot;$PYTHON $TESTDIR/../scripts/cram&quot;      &gt; fi      $ command -v md5 &gt; /dev/null || alias md5=md5sum    Usage:      $ cram -h      [Uu]sage: cram \[OPTIONS\] TESTS\.\.\. (re)      [Oo]ptions: (re)        -h, --help          show this help message and exit        -V, --version       show version information and exit        -q, --quiet         don't print diffs        -v, --verbose       show filenames and test status        -i, --interactive   interactively merge changed test output        -d, --debug         write script output directly to the terminal        -y, --yes           answer yes to all questions        -n, --no            answer no to all questions        -E, --preserve-env  don't reset common environment variables        --keep-tmpdir       keep temporary directories        --shell=PATH        shell to use for running tests (default: /bin/sh)        --shell-opts=OPTS   arguments to invoke shell with        --indent=NUM        number of spaces to use for indentation (default: 2)        --xunit-file=PATH   path to write xUnit XML outputThe format in a nutshell:* Cram tests use the ``.t`` file extension.* Lines beginning with two spaces, a dollar sign, and a space are run  in the shell.* Lines beginning with two spaces, a greater than sign, and a space  allow multi-line commands.* All other lines beginning with two spaces are considered command  output.* Output lines ending with a space and the keyword ``(re)`` are  matched as `Perl-compatible regular expressions`_.* Lines ending with a space and the keyword ``(glob)`` are matched  with a glob-like syntax. The only special characters supported are  ``*`` and ``?``. Both characters can be escaped using ``\``, and the  backslash can be escaped itself.* Output lines ending with either of the above keywords are always  first matched literally with actual command output.* Lines ending with a space and the keyword ``(no-eol)`` will match  actual output that doesn't end in a newline.* Actual output lines containing unprintable characters are escaped  and suffixed with a space and the keyword ``(esc)``. Lines matching  unprintable output must also contain the keyword.* Anything else is a comment... _Cram's own test suite: https://bitbucket.org/brodie/cram/src/0.6/tests/cram.t.. _Perl-compatible regular expressions: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_Compatible_Regular_ExpressionsDownload--------* `cram-0.7.tar.gz`_ (32 KB, requires Python 2.4-2.7 or Python 3.1 or newer).. _cram-0.7.tar.gz: https://bitheap.org/cram/cram-0.7.tar.gzInstallation------------Install Cram using make::    $ wget https://bitheap.org/cram/cram-0.7.tar.gz    $ tar zxvf cram-0.7.tar.gz    $ cd cram-0.7    $ make installUsage-----Cram will print a dot for each passing test. If a test fails, a`unified context diff`_ is printed showing the test's expected outputand the actual output. Skipped tests (empty tests and tests that exitwith return code ``80``) are marked with ``s`` instead of a dot.For example, if we run Cram on `its own example tests`_::    .s.!    --- examples/fail.t    +++ examples/fail.t.err    @@ -3,21 +3,22 @@       $ echo 1       1       $ echo 1    -  2    +  1       $ echo 1       1     Invalid regex:       $ echo 1    -  +++ (re)    +  1     Offset regular expression:       $ printf 'foo\nbar\nbaz\n\n1\nA\n@\n'       foo    +  bar       baz       \d (re)       [A-Z] (re)    -  #    +  @    s.    # Ran 6 tests, 2 skipped, 1 failed.Cram will also write the test with its actual output to``examples/fail.t.err``, allowing you to use other diff tools. Thisfile is automatically removed the next time the test passes.When you're first writing a test, you might just write the commandsand run the test to see what happens. If you run Cram with ``-i`` or``--interactive``, you'll be prompted to merge the actual output backinto the test. This makes it easy to quickly prototype new tests.You can specify a default set of options by creating a ``.cramrc``file. For example::    [cram]    verbose = True    indent = 4Is the same as invoking Cram with ``--verbose`` and ``--indent=4``.To change what configuration file Cram loads, you can set the``CRAMRC`` environment variable. You can also specify command lineoptions in the ``CRAM`` environment variable.Note that the following environment variables are reset before testsare run:* ``TMPDIR``, ``TEMP``, and ``TMP`` are set to the test runner's  ``tmp`` directory.* ``LANG``, ``LC_ALL``, and ``LANGUAGE`` are set to ``C``.* ``TZ`` is set to ``GMT``.* ``COLUMNS`` is set to ``80``. (Note: When using ``--shell=zsh``,  this cannot be reset. It will reflect the actual terminal's width.)* ``CDPATH`` and ``GREP_OPTIONS`` are set to an empty string.Cram also provides the following environment variables to tests:* ``CRAMTMP``, set to the test runner's temporary directory.* ``TESTDIR``, set to the directory containing the test file.* ``TESTFILE``, set to the basename of the current test file.* ``TESTSHELL``, set to the value specified by ``--shell``.Also note that care should be taken with commands that close the testshell's ``stdin``. For example, if you're trying to invoke ``ssh`` ina test, try adding the ``-n`` option to prevent it from closing``stdin``. Similarly, if you invoke a daemon process that inherits``stdout`` and fails to close it, it may cause Cram to hang whilewaiting for the test shell's ``stdout`` to be fully closed... _unified context diff: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff#Unified_format.. _its own example tests: https://bitbucket.org/brodie/cram/src/default/examples/Development-----------Download the official development repository using Mercurial_::    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/brodie/cramOr Git_::    git clone https://github.com/brodie/cram.gitTest Cram using Cram::    pip install -r requirements.txt    make testVisit Bitbucket_ or GitHub_ if you'd like to fork the project, watchfor new changes, or report issues... _Mercurial: http://mercurial.selenic.com/.. _Git: http://git-scm.com/.. _coverage.py: http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/.. _Bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/brodie/cram.. _GitHub: https://github.com/brodie/cram</longdescription>

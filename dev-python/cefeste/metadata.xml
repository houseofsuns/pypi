	<longdescription># **C**redito **E**miliano -  **Fe**ature **S**election, **T**ransformation and **E**limination (CE - FeSTE)This repo contains the 'FeSTE' python package which helps in the features management from the pre-filtering to the pre-processing and feature elimination.# InstallationTo install it:1) **Optional**: create a new Python virtual environment (through bash terminal run: &quot;py -m venv your_env_name&quot; and then &quot;source your_env_name/Scripts/activate )2) Install the package:    - User Mode: ```pip install cefeste```# StructureThe .py package is stored in src and contains 3 sub-modules:- **selection**: contains the feature preliminary selection functions- **transform**: contains the feature pre-processing functions- **elimination**: contains the feature elimination functions# Filters## SelectionThe main class of this module is FeatureSelection. It applies several filters that can be grouped in the following:- Univariate filters:    - No constant features    - Number of distinct value too low    - Number of missing values too high    - Too concentrate in the most frequent value    - Unstable between sets- Multivariate filters:    - Spearman Correlation for numerical features    - Cramer's V for categorical features    - R2 for mixed features    - VIF- Explanatory filters:    - Feature AUROC for classification     - Feature Correlation with target for regression    ## TrasformationIt is more a technical module which contains 3 classes useful for generating the production pipeline:- ColumnExtractor: to extract columns from a pd.DataFrame- ColumnRenamer: to rename columns and to transform a np.ndarray to a pd.DataFrame- Categorizer: to trasform the dtype of pd.DataFrame columns from 'object' to 'category'## EliminationThe main class of this module is FeatureElimination which is useful for selecting the most useful feature to keep in the model and optimize the hyperparams in the meanwhile.It is a recursive method that at each iteration can:- Perform the hyperparameters optimization using user-defined model, grid, gridsearch method, evaluation measure- Calculate the feature shap importance value- Identify the last importance feature(/s) and Delete them for the next iteration</longdescription>

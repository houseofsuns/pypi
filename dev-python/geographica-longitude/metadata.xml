Install ```poetry``` using the [recommended process](https://github.com/sdispater/poetry#installation)    1. poetry is installed globally as a tool    1. It works along with virtualenvironments1. Create a virtual environment for Python 3.x (check the current development version in ```pyproject.toml```)    1. You can create it wherever you want but do not put it inside the project    1. A nice place is ```$HOME/virtualenvs/longitude```1. Clone the ```longitude``` repo1. `cd` to the repo and:    1. Activate the virtual environment: `. ~/virtualenvs/longitude/bin/activate`    1. Run `poetry install`1. Configure your IDE to use the virtual environment### Daily1. Remember to activate the virtual environment ### Why Poetry?Because it handles development dependencies and packaging with a single file (```pyproject.toml```), which is [already standard](https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyproject_toml.html).## Sample scriptsThese are intended to be used with real databases (i.e. those in your profile) to check features of the library. They must be run from the virtual environment.## Testing and coverage The [```pytest-cov```](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) plugin is being used. Coverage configuration is at ```.coveragerc``` (including output folder).You can run something like: ```pytest --cov-report=html --cov=core core``` and the results will go in the defined html folder.There is a bash script called ```generate_core_coverage.sh``` that runs the coverage analysis and shows the report in your browser.</longdescription>

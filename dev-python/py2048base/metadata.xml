More useful for testing than actual gameplay, though.**********How to use**********To implement a frontend=======================The backend takes input (in the form of a `py2048.Directions` object),processes it, and waits for the next input.This loops untilthe player exits, orthe player wins for the first time in this session, orthe player runs out of valid movements.It's a pure-Python implementation of the original game logic:it makes equal numbers merge into their sum, &quot;moving&quot; from one tile intoanother, and so on.The backend deals only with plain Python data, such as `int` and `dict`;it is up to each frontend to actually collect the input and display theupdated game state as a (hopefully) pretty interface.To write such frontend, subclass `py2048.basefrontend.Base2048Frontend`and override the following methods:* `choose_direction`* `on_player_quit`* `on_player_victory`* `on_player_overvictory`* `on_player_loss``choose_direction` must return exactly one `py2048.Directions` object.If writing a graphical frontend (a GUI), you'll probably want to create a &quot;worker&quot;thread that runs the backend's loop and waits for a condition when it reachesthe `choose_direction` call.The main thread will then be responsible for storing user input somewhere accessibleby the worker thread and &quot;waking it up&quot;.The other overriden methods shouldn't return anything.`player_quit` is called when the player exits the game before winning orlosing.An &quot;overvictory&quot; is what happens when the grid &quot;jams&quot; (runs out of valid movements)but the player had already won (had already reached the target goal number).To run tests============We're using the `pytest` library to check the correctness of the basicdata structures.To run the tests, open a terminal, move into the root folder of the project(the one which contains `setup.py`), and type the following:    pytest-3 -v py2048/test.pyMake sure you're in the right folder,that there are no slashes in the command, andthat it doesn't end with *.py*.Alternatively, use    make test********Wishlist********In the future, I'd like to create an AI to play the game!------------************How it works************Backend=======Its main components are the `Cell` and the `Grid`.The `Cell` class is a wrapper over an `int` that represents a tile in the gamegrid.It has a `locked` property, which is simply a `bool` that determines whether itcan change its stored `int` in this cycle.A cycle is what happens between the arrival of a valid user input and the momentthe game pauses to get the next input.This `locked` property prevents a 2 merging into a 2 and the resulting 4 merginginto another 4 all in a single cycle, for example.If you play the original game, you'll notice that is not allowed.The `Grid` is a wrapper over a `dict` that maps points into `Cells`(and points are named tuples that store x and y coordinates).This class (along with `py2048.basefrontend.Base2048Frontend`), implements mostof the game logic.It's responsible for determining how and when one `Cell` can merge into another,updating the score, and so on.Frontend========.. _game: https://play2048.co/.. _cirulli: http://gabrielecirulli.com__ cirulli_</longdescription>

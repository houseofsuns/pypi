	<longdescription># Komi-Zyrian morphological analyzerThis is a rule-based morphological analyzer for Komi-Zyrian literary standard (``kpv``) of the Komi language continuum (Uralic &gt; Permic). It is based on a formalized description of literary Komi-Zyrian morphology, which also includes a number of dialectal elements, and uses [uniparser-morph](https://github.com/timarkh/uniparser-morph) for parsing. It performs full morphological analysis of Komi-Zyrian words (lemmatization, POS tagging, grammatical tagging, glossing).## How to use### Python packageThe analyzer is available as a Python package. If you want to analyze Komi texts in Python, install the module:```pip3 install uniparser-komi-zyrian```Import the module and create an instance of ``KomiZyrianAnalyzer`` class. Set ``mode='strict'`` if you are going to process text in standard orthography, or ``mode='nodiacritics'`` if you expect some words to lack the diacritics (which often happens in social media). After that, you can either parse tokens or lists of tokens with ``analyze_words()``, or parse a frequency list with ``analyze_wordlist()``. Here is a simple example:```pythonfrom uniparser_komi_zyrian import KomiZyrianAnalyzera = KomiZyrianAnalyzer(mode='strict')analyses = a.analyze_words('Морфологияса')# The parser is initialized before first use, so expect# some delay here (usually several seconds)# You will get a list of Wordform objects# The analysis attributes are stored in its properties# as string values, e.g.:for ana in analyses:        print(ana.wf, ana.lemma, ana.gramm, ana.gloss)# You can also pass lists (even nested lists) and specify# output format ('xml' or 'json')# If you pass a list, you will get a list of analyses# with the same structureanalyses = a.analyze_words([['А'], ['Ме', 'тэнӧ', 'радейта', '.']],                       format='xml')analyses = a.analyze_words(['Морфологияса', [['А'], ['Ме', 'тэнӧ', 'радейта', '.']]],                       format='json')```Refer to the [uniparser-morph documentation](https://uniparser-morph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for the full list of options.### DisambiguationDisambiguation is not yet available for this language.### Word listsAlternatively, you can use a preprocessed word list. The ``wordlists`` directory contains a list of words from a 1.8-million-word [Komi-Zyrian corpus](http://komi-zyrian.web-corpora.net/) (``wordlist_main.csv``), list of analyzed tokens (``wordlist_analyzed.txt``; each line contains all possible analyses for one word in an XML format), and list of tokens the parser could not analyze (``wordlist_unanalyzed.txt``). The recall of the analyzer is 92.2% on literary texts and 89.1% on social media texts.## Description formatThe description is carried out in the ``uniparser-morph`` format and involves a description of the inflection (paradigms.txt), a grammatical dictionary (kpv_lexemes_XXX.txt files), a list of rules that annotate combinations of lexemes and grammatical values with additional Russian translations (lex_rules.txt), and a short list of analyses that should be avoided (bad_analyses.txt). The dictionary contains descriptions of individual lexemes, each of which is accompanied by information about its stem, its part-of-speech tag and some other grammatical/borrowing information, its inflectional type (paradigm), and Russian translation. See more about the format [in the uniparser-morph documentation](https://uniparser-morph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html).</longdescription>

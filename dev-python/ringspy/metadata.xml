Installation CheckThere are some unit tests in [tests](https://github.com/kingyin3613/ringspy/tree/main/tests/). One can use ``pytest`` to check whether the installation is successful by firstly moving to ``pytest`` directory and then running this command:```bashpytest .```## Getting Started (Current version: v1.0.2)Once all required components are installed and one is ready to begin, a path forward should be established for generating the mesh. The basic steps for running/viewing a cellular mesh are listed as the following:    1. Edit geometry and algorithm parameters    2. Generate mesh using Mesh Generation Tools    3. Visualize 2D view using Matplotlib or 3D model in `ParaView`    4. (Optional) Export 3D STL model for 3D editing and/or printing5. (Optional) Export input file for numerical simulations with software `Abaqus`### 1. Geometry and ParametersThe first step to generate a cellular geometry is selecting geometry and appropriate parameters. ### 1.1. GeometryA template file, for example, `test_wood_cube.py` located in the [tests](https://github.com/kingyin3613/ringspy/tree/main/tests/) directory acts as both the parameter input file, and main executable for the generation of a cubic wood specimen.*Note: The Mesh Generation Tool by now only accepts many of pre-defined boundary geometries (for v1.0.x, the following 3 shapes are supported: triangle, square, hexagon), importing of CAD and/or other 3D model files will be implemented in subsequent versions.**Note: for greatest compatibility create the geometry using all millimeters.*### 1.2. ParametersBy opening a input file, e.g., `tests/test_wood_cube.py` in any text editor, a file format similar to what is shown below will be displayed:```geoName = 'wood_cube'path = 'meshes'radial_growth_rule = 'binary'iter_max = 500 # increase this number to achieve a more regular geometryprint_interval = 500 # interval for printing prgress info# Radial cell growth parameters# length unit: mmr_min = 0   # inner radius of generation domainr_max = 4   # outer radius of generation domainnrings = 4 # number of ringswidth_heart = 0.3*(r_max-r_min)/nrings # ring width for the innermost ringwidth_sparse = 0.7*(r_max-r_min)/nrings # ring width for rings with sparse cellswidth_dense = 0.3*(r_max-r_min)/nrings # ring width for rings with dense cellsgeneration_center = (0,0) # coordinates of generation domain centercellsize_sparse = 0.02cellsize_dense = 0.01cellwallthickness_sparse = 0.010cellwallthickness_dense = 0.006# clipping box parametersboundaryFlag = 'on'box_shape = 'square'box_center = (0,0) # coordinates of clipping box centerbox_size = 4.0 # side length# longitudinal direction parametersnsegments = 2 # increase this number to achieve a smoother transition in longitudinal direction if theta is largetheta_min = 0 # unit: radiantheta_max = 0.05 # unit: radianz_min = 0z_max = box_size # segment_length = (z_max - z_min) / nsegmentslong_connector_ratio = 0.02 # longitudinal joint length = ratio * segment_length# material parametersskeleton_density = 1.5e-9 # unit: tonne/mm3# generation parametersmerge_operation = 'on'merge_tol = 0.01precrackFlag = 'off'precrack_widths = 0.1stlFlag = 'on'inpFlag = 'on'inpType = 'Abaqus'```- `geoName` is the geometry name, `path` is the folder where the mesh files will be generated.- `radial_growth_rule` is the radial growth rule for cell placement. When a file name with extension`.npy` is specified, a saved cell data file will be loaded (for v1.0.x, choose one of these rules: `binary`, `binary_lloyd`, `regular_hexagonal`, or a file name with extension `.npy`).- `iter_max` is the max number of iteration for randomly placing non-overlapping cell particles in the 2D toroidal cell placement region. Noticing that, larger `iter_max` leads to more centroidal Voronoi cells, for more reference, see [Wiki - Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centroidal_Voronoi_tessellation/).- `print_interval` is the print interval when every n cell particles are placed in the placement region.- `r_min` and `r_max` are the upper and lower bounds of radii of toroidal cell placement regions (generation rings), `nrings` is the total number of rings.- `width_heart`, `width_sparse`, and `width_dense`, are ring widths for innermost ring, rings with sparse cells, and rings with dense cells, respectively, which all together determine the morphology of the cellular structure.- `generation_center` is the location of the placement region.- `cellsize_sparse`,`cellsize_dense`, `cellwallthickness_sparse`, and `cellwallthickness_dense` are parameters for the sparse and dense cells.- `boundaryFlag` flag can be turned on/off for generating neat boundaries consisting of grains.- `box_shape` is the shape of cutting box (for v1.0.x, choose one of following shapes: `triangle`, `square`, or `hexagon`).- `box_center`, and `box_size` are for describing the cutting box.- `nsegments` is the number of segments consisting the prismatic cells during the z- (longitudinal) extrusion, with `segment_length = (z_max - z_min) / nsegments`.- `theta_min` and `theta_max` determine the twisting angles (unit: radian) of the 2D mesh around the `generation_center`, during the spiral z-extrusion.- `z_min` and `z_max` determine the boundaries of prismatic cells in z- (longitudinal) direction.- `long_connector_ratio` is the length of longitudinal joints, with `longitudinal joint length = ratio * segment_length`.- `skeleton_density` is the density of the skeleton (substance) material, e.g. density of wood cell walls in the wood microstructure. - `merge_operation` flag can be turned on/off for the merging operation, when flag is on, cell ridges that are shorter than the threshold `merge_tol` in the 2D mesh will be deleted, and their vertices will be merged respectively, the mesh will be reconstructed. This is designed for eliminating small cell ridges/walls which fall out of the resolution range of the 3D printing and for avoiding having elements with too small stable time increments in numerical simulations. - `precrackFlag` flag is for inserting a pre-crack, for the notched specimens (for v1.0.x, only a single line pre-crack with the length of `precrack_widths` is supported).- `stlFlag` flag can be turned on/off for generating 3D STL files.- `inpFlag` flag can be turned on/off for generating input files for numerical simulations.- `inpType` indicates the software(s) that the mesh generation should generate input files for.![growth_rule_binary](&lt;./contents/growth_rule_binary.png&gt;)### 2.1. Run Mesh GenerationOpen a Command Prompt or Terminal window and set the current directory to [tests](https://github.com/kingyin3613/ringspy/tree/main/tests/) or any other directory, then run the command:```python test_wood_cube.py```Functions in `MeshGenTools` library will be called to create the initial mesh, wood cell particles following certain cell size distribution will be placed, then `Scipy.voronoi` function will be called to form the initial 2D Voronoi tessellation, additional code reforms the tesselation and generates the desired files. A successful generation will end with the line &quot;Files generated ...&quot; in the Terminal window.A new folder should have been created in the `.\meshes` directory with the same name as the `geoName` in `test_wood_cube.py`.${\color{red}\textbf{(New feature in version v0.4.x)}}$The Lloyd's relaxation (a.k.a. Lloyd's algorithm) has been integrated with the mesh generation, one may use this approach by changing the following line in the input file:```radial_growth_rule = binary_lloyd``` This allows a rapid radial generation of more regular centroidal Voronoi cells from the `generation_center` (see the difference between `wood_binary` and `wood_binary_lloyd` in the preview of 2D cross-sections in section 2.2). For more detail of the algorithm, see [Wiki - Lloyd's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd's_algorithm)).![lloyd](&lt;./contents/lloyd.gif&gt;)### 2.2. Check Mesh and 3D Model FilesThe following files should be generated in the `.\meshes\geoName` directory with a successful run:- Log file    - Log file for model generation: `wood_cube-report.log`- Mesh files    - Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) beam file: `wood_cubeIGA.txt`    - connector data file: `wood_cube-mesh.txt`    - Grain-ridge data file: `wood_cube-vertex.mesh`    - Ridge data file: `wood_cube-ridge.mesh`- Visualization files    - Cross-sectional image file for initial 2D configuration: `wood_cube.png`    - Paraview vtk file for initial vertex configuration: `wood_cube_vertices.vtu`    - Paraview vtk file for initial grain solid configuration: `wood_cube_beams.vtu`    - Paraview vtk file of initial cell ridge configuration: `wood_cube_conns.vtu`    - Paraview vtk file of initial connector (volume) configuration: `wood_cube_conns_vol.vtu`- (Optional) 3D model files    - STL file of initial cellular solid configuration: `wood_cube.stl`- (Optional) Abaqus input files    - INP file of simulation input of initial cellular solid configuration in `Abaqus`: `wood_cube.inp`![Model2DPreview](&lt;./contents/Model2DPreview.png&gt;)### 3. VisualizationA scientific visualization application `ParaView` can directly visualize the generated vtk files; It can also visualize generated 3D model STL files if the STL flag is on. `Paraview` is a free software, it can be downloaded from its official website: [https://www.paraview.org/download/](https://www.paraview.org/download/), latest version is recommeded.### 3.1.

(Optional) Numerical SimulationThe mesh generation tool can also prepare the input files for the numerical simulations of the cellular solid in other softwares. By now (version 1.0.0), the input file format, `.inp`, that is used in a finite element method (FEM) software `Abaqus` is supported, if the INP flag is on. `Abaqus` is a commerical software suite for integrated computer-aided engineering (CAE) and finite element analysis, own by `Dassault Systèmes`. One may refer to its [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abaqus) for more about `Abaqus`, and to [Introduction](https://bertoldi.seas.harvard.edu/files/bertoldi/files/abaqusinputfilemanualv1.pdf?m=1444417191) for the introduction of Abaqus input files.All steps for the model setup can be accomplished through manually coding the Abaqus input file in a text editor. The method used in the example procedure shown below requires access to the Abaqus GUI.### 4.1 Create New Model    1. Open Abaqus CAE    2. Create a new model        -File &gt; New Model Database &gt; With Standard/Explicit Model### 4.2 Import Meshed Part    1.

And expectations you'rerecording are basically assertions that must pass before test ends. Alongwith expectations you can also record actions the mock will execute oncecalled. And all of these is provided by simple, expressive and easy to useAPI.Here's a simple example:```pythonfrom mockify.core import satisfiedfrom mockify.mock import Mockfrom mockify.actions import Returndef func_caller(func):    return func()def test_func_caller():    func_mock = Mock('greet')    func_mock.expect_call().will_once(Return('Hello, world!'))    with satisfied(func_mock):        assert func_caller(func_mock) == 'Hello, world!'```Mockify allows you to:* Record expectations with any number of positional and/or keyword arguments,* Set expected call count or call count range,* Record **action chains**, allowing subsequent action can be performed on  subsequent call to same mock,* Record **repeated** actions that can be executed any number of times,* Use **matchers**, allowing to match range of parameters the mock is called  with instead of exact ones,* and more.I hope you'll find this library useful.Documentation-------------Newest documentation can be found at https://mockify.readthedocs.org/.Source------Source code is available at https://gitlab.com/zef1r/mockify/.License-------This software is released under the terms of the MIT license.</longdescription>

Theseexamples also show how to integrate GatorGrader with [GitHubClassroom](https://classroom.github.com/) and [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.com/). When you follow these examples, the Gradle pluginfor GatorGrader will install it automatically when you run `gradle grade` in aterminal window. Please be aware that these repositories are meant to have a majorityof red checks. This is only meant to be a “starter” and give an insight into what must be accomplished within the lab.* Solution RepositoriesThe next step to get involved with GatorGrader is to checkout our sample solutionrepositories. The following solution repositories provide examples of how GatorGrader files should becreated to check programs and documentation for different languages:[Java](https://github.com/GatorEducator/java-assignment-solution-100-01),[Python](https://github.com/GatorEducator/python-assignment-solution-203-05), [LaTex](https://github.com/GatorEducator/latex-assignment-solution-100-01) , and [HTML with CSS](https://github.com/GatorEducator/html-assignment-solution-302-03). These examplesalso show how to integrate GatorGrader with  [GitHubClassroom](https://classroom.github.com/) and [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.com/).  When you follow these examples, the Gradle pluginfor GatorGrader will install it automatically when you run `gradle grade` in aterminal window. Please be aware that these repositories are meant to have a majorityof green checks. This is meant to show what must be accomplished within a lab/practicaland what it looks like when those tasks are completed.## Key FeaturesGatorGrader automatically checks the work of technical writers and programmers.It can:* Enable [GatorGrade](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrade) to check  projects implemented and documented in a wide variety of languages (e.g.,  Java, Python, LaTeX, Markdown, HTML, and CSS).* Integrate with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/) to check  solution and starter repositories created for professors and students,  respectively.* Run in a cloud-based environment like [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) or  on the command-line of a developer's workstation.* Operate as a &quot;batteries included&quot; grading tool, supporting automated checks  like the following:  * Does a file exist in the correct directory with the requested name?  * Does technical writing contain the desired number of words and paragraphs?  * Does source code contain the designated number of language-specific comments?  * Does source code or technical writing contain a required fragment or match    a specified regular expression?  * Does a command execute correctly and produce the expected number of output    lines?  * Does a command execute and produce output containing a fragment or matching    a regular expression?  * Does a GitHub repository contain the anticipated number of commits?Aligning with key recommendations in a recent [National Academiesreport](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/24926/assessing-and-responding-to-the-growth-of-computer-science-undergraduate-enrollments),GatorGrader helps instructors automatically check student submissions in bothintroductory and application-oriented classes using languages like Markdown,Java, Python, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. GatorGrader does not aim to solveproblems related to building and linting a project or managing an assignment'ssubmission, instead integrating with existing tools and systems like[Gradle](https://gradle.org/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), and [GitHubClassroom](https://classroom.github.com/) to effectively handle those tasks.## Installing GatorGraderInstalling GatorGrader is not necessary if you intend to use it through [GatorGrade](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrade).If you want to participate in the development of GatorGrader, the projectmaintainers suggest the use of [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) toinstall Python 3.7 or above. In addition to installing [Git](https://git-scm.com/)to access the project's GitHub repository, you should also install[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for its support of package and virtualenvironment management. After completing the installation of these tools, youcan type the following command in your terminal window to clone GatorGrader'sGitHub repository:```bashgit clone https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader.git```If you plan to develop new features for GatorGrader or if you want to run thetool's test suite in [Pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest), then youwill need to install a virtual environment for development by typing `poetry install`in the directory that contains GatorGrader. For help with this process, refer to[Poetry's documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).## Testing GatorGrader### Automated TestingThe developers use [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) for the testingof GatorGrader. Depending on your goals, there are several differentconfigurations in which you can run the provided test suite. If you want to runthe test suite to see if the test cases are passing, then running this commandin a terminal window will perform testing with the version of Python with whichPoetry's virtual environment was initialized.```poetry run task test```### Test CoverageAlong with running the test suite, the developers of GatorGrader use statementand branch coverage to enhance their testing activities. To see the coverage ofthe tests while also highlighting the lines that are not currently covered bythe tests, you can run this command in a terminal window. As with the previouscommand, this will run the tests in the version of Python with which Poetry'svirtual environment was initialized.```poetry run task cover```### Testing with Multiple Python VersionsThe previous two commands are restricted to running the test suite in theversion of Python with which Poetry was initialized. If you have installed multipleversions of Python with Pyenv and you want to iteratively initialized Poetry with eachversion and then run the test suite, then you should first run the followingcommands to install [Pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) and use Pipx toinstall [Invoke](https://github.com/pyinvoke/invoke). The first of these threecommands will install `pipx`, a program that supports the execution of Pythonpackages in isolated environments. The second command makes the directory`~/.local/bin/` a part of the search path for executable Python programs and thethird one installs the `invoke` command so that it is available on yourworkstation outside of a virtual environment managed by Poetry, thereby ensuringthat it is always available to run tasks.```pip install pipx --userpython -m userpath append ~/.local/bin/pipx install invoke```Now you can run the test suite in the specified versions of Python with thefollowing command. This example command will run the test suite in Python 3.6.8and Python 3.7.3.```invoke -c scripts/tasks test --pyenv 3.6.8 --pyenv 3.7.3```If you want to track test coverage while running the tests in both Python 3.6.8and 3.7.3, then you can run the following command.```invoke -c scripts/tasks cover --pyenv 3.6.8 --pyenv 3.7.3```You can switch the version with which Poetry is initialized by running the followingcommand that adopts, for instance, Python 3.7.3.```invoke -c scripts/tasks switch --pyenv 3.7.3```### Code LintingThe developers of GatorGrader use linting and code formatting tools, such as[Pylint](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint),[Pydocstyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pydocstyle), and[Black](https://github.com/python/black). After installing GatorGrader'sdevelopment dependencies with Poetry, you can run all of the linters by typingthis command in a terminal window.```bashpoetry run task lint --check```### Automated ChecksWant to learn about our linting checks? Check us out on our website,[GatorGrader](https://www.gatorgrader.org/)! We have detaileddescriptions of our linting checks and more! To get an idea of the linting checks weoffer, here is a quick list:1. ConfirmFileExists2. CountCommandOutput3. CountCommits4. CountFileLines5. CountFileParagraphsWant to learn about our automated checks? Check them out on our website,[gatorgrader.org](http://www.gatorgrader.org)! We have detaileddescriptions of our automated checks and more!Something you should know when working with our checks is that all ofthem come with some **optional arguments**. Optional arguments that you are likelyto encounter:* `-h`* `--help`* `--exact`* `--advanced`If `--help` is tagged along with a check then a help message will be displayed andthen exited. If further assistance is needed, please contact us on GitHub.Another feature with our automated checks is the **plug-in based approach**. This allowsusers to implement their own check if our initial checks do not fulfill a check thatyou find necessary.## Running GatorGraderStudents and instructors normally use GatorGrader through [GatorGrade](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrade),specifying the requested checks in a `gatorgrade.yml` file. When run through GatorGrade, GatorGraderreports each check that it performed, additionally sharing a diagnostic messagefor each check that did not pass. Individuals who want to run GatorGrader as astand-alone Python application can install GatorGrader itself through [Pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/),and then run `gatorgrader --help` to get more details on the command-line interface.Instructors often run GatorGrader in conjunction with other tools that checksource code and technical writing. For instance, in a Java-based introductorycourse, instructors could verify student submissions with[Checkstyle](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle), thereby ensuring thatthe Java source code adheres to the requirements in the [Google Java StyleGuide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html). In this course, aninstructor could require that Markdown files with technical writing meet thestandards described in the [Markdown SyntaxGuide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), meaning that allMarkdown files must pass the checks performed by the [Markdown lintingtool](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint). These assignments couldalso require that all submitted technical writing must adhere to the standardsset by the [Proselint tool](http://proselint.com/). Since GatorGrader can run anarbitrary command and check its error code, it is also possible to integrate itwith a wide variety of other linters, code formatters, and testing tools.Instructors may at times need to see a full list of checks to have a better understandingand therefore, we feel that it is important to know that there is an easy way for that to happen.This action will be completed through command line and therefore, you can type`gatorgrader ListChecks` into your terminal, if you've installed GatorGrader as detailed above.This allows for all of the checks to be printed out as output. This output will have the necessaryname labeled with the required and optional arguments. If this output does not give enough content,we warmly invite you to navigate to our website, where we go into more detail about our Automated Checks.## Using Docker_Note: Docker supports the older GatorGrader execution tool, [GatorGradle](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgradle). It is not needed for GatorGrade!_A vital part of our process for GatorGrader is to implement and use new techniquesto further our tool to grow. This is why we chose to use Docker! Docker is a containerplatform and therefore, allows students using GatorGrader to just open a containerand have easy access to run all commands that would allow them to build, run, andgrade their labs and practicals. Docker is an industry standard and therefore,gives us an advantage. To open a container that will allow for the use of GatorGrader,run the following command in your terminal window:```docker run -it --rm --name dockagator \  -v &quot;$(pwd)&quot;:/project \  -v &quot;$HOME/.dockagator&quot;:/root/.local/share \  gatoreducator/dockagator /bin/bash```From here, you are set! Test it out by building, running, or grading your lab/practical!If you would like to learn more about Docker, please follow this [link](https://www.docker.com).## Comparison to Other ToolsOther automated grading tools include:- [autograde-github-classroom](https://github.com/apanangadan/autograde-github-classroom): &quot;scripts to download and grade submissions to Github Classroom&quot;- [check50](https://github.com/cs50/check50): &quot;a tool for checking student code&quot;- [Classroom Assistant](https://classroom.github.com/assistant): &quot;desktop application to help you get student repositories for grading&quot;- [nbgrader](https://github.com/jupyter/nbgrader): &quot;a system for assigning and grading notebooks&quot;- [nerfherder](https://github.com/kevinwortman/nerfherder): &quot;scripts for automating grading with GitHub Classroom and Moodle&quot;- [Submitty](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty): &quot;homework submission, automated grading, and TA grading system&quot;- [WebCat](https://github.com/web-cat): &quot;all-in-one plugin for full processing and feedback generation&quot;Designed for instructors who want an alternative to simple scripts orstand-alone platforms that do not integrate with industry-standardinfrastructure like GitHub and Travis CI, GatorGrader is a tool thatautomatically checks the work of technical writers and programmers. Unlike othersystems, GatorGrader provides a &quot;batteries included&quot; approach to automatedgrading that makes it easy for instructors to combine well-tested checks forprojects that students implement in a wide variety of programming languages.GatorGrader's developers take its engineering seriously, maintainingstandards-compliant source code, a test suite with 100% statement and branchcoverage, and top-notch source code and user documentation.## PresentationsGatorGrader's creators give presentations about the development, use, andassessment of the tool.

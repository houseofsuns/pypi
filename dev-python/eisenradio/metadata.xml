Your browser connects to Flask   * Backend (server) opens the connection, buffers the radio stream and presents it to localhost IP: 127.0.0.1   * Frontend (browser) controls the backend, plays internet and local audio playlists   * Browser audio element connects `http://localhost:5050/sound/classic` that streams `http://37.251.146.169:8000/streamHD`   * Closing the browser does not disconnect the server listen (buffer discarded) nor streaming connections * Plays and repairs aac plus files; play (1.3), repairs since version (1.4);  * Backup and restore are easy work with the help of an optional ex/imported human-readable *ini file * Blacklist feature for recorded files (titles); delete only once    * lists can be ex/imported via a json dictionary file to other devices * playing local audio uses the web server multiple file upload feature * Multithreading allows you an unlimited number of radio connections at the same time, until the ISP Bandwidth limit hits * Android APK Package uses Python Kivy for multi-touch and promotes the app to &quot;foreground service&quot; (to not get killed)             &quot;&quot;&quot; sketch &quot;&quot;&quot;           |B |               |S | Flask web server, Header[Werkzeug/2.0.2 Python/3.10.1]         |r |listen         |e |-------&gt; starRadio         |o |-------&gt;   &lt;-- |r |         |w |GhettoRecorder |v |-------&gt; planetRadio         |s |---&gt;    &lt;----- |e |         |e |               |r |-------&gt; satteliteRadio         |r |               |  |         net: localhost     net: internet         CORS: accept       CORS: deny         audioNode: 1,-1    audioNode: 0, 0         JavaScript,CSS     Python,SQL    Cross-Origin Resource Sharing mechanism (CORS)     i.a. prevents a Browser from analysing audio from internet    command line ------------Start browser from command line       $ eisenradioCall the command line app with one of two commands.    $ eisenradio-cmdOr, EisenRadio sits on top of 'GhettoRecorder' package https://pypi.org/project/GhettoRecorder/    $ ghettorecorderYou can export your ``settings.ini`` and ``blacklist.json`` via &quot;Tools/Export/Names and URL's&quot; menu from your database.An updated ``blacklist.json`` can be imported into your database.* Command line save path is in the package folder.

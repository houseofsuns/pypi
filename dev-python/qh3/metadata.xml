Cryptography will remain as long as Python does not ship with proper QUIC implementation.- Mitigated deprecated match_hostname.- Mimic load_default_certs SSL context from native Python.- Remove the need for OpenSSL development headers.- Many, many more pre-built wheel for your convenience! Including PyPy 3.8 and 3.9 and musl linux distributions.``qh3`` is a library for the QUIC network protocol in Python. It featuresa minimal TLS 1.3 implementation, a QUIC stack and an HTTP/3 stack.QUIC was standardised in `RFC 9000`_ and HTTP/3 in `RFC 9114`_.``qh3`` is regularly tested for interoperability against other`QUIC implementations`_.To learn more about ``qh3`` please `read the documentation`_.Why should I use ``aioquic``?-----------------------------``qh3`` has been designed to be embedded into Python client and serverlibraries wishing to support QUIC and / or HTTP/3. The goal is to provide acommon codebase for Python libraries in the hope of avoiding duplicated effort.Both the QUIC and the HTTP/3 APIs follow the &quot;bring your own I/O&quot; pattern,leaving actual I/O operations to the API user. This approach has a number ofadvantages including making the code testable and allowing integration withdifferent concurrency models.Features--------- QUIC stack conforming with `RFC 9000`_- HTTP/3 stack conforming with `RFC 9114`_- minimal TLS 1.3 implementation conforming with `RFC 8446`_- IPv4 and IPv6 support- connection migration and NAT rebinding- logging TLS traffic secrets- logging QUIC events in QLOG format- HTTP/3 server push supportRequirements------------``aioquic`` requires Python 3.7 or greater.Running the examples--------------------`qh3` comes with a number of examples illustrating various QUIC use-cases.You can browse these examples here: https://github.com/Ousret/qh3/tree/main/examplesLicense-------``qh3`` is released under the `BSD license`_... _read the documentation: https://aioquic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.. _QUIC implementations: https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/wiki/Implementations.. _cryptography: https://cryptography.io/.. _Chocolatey: https://chocolatey.org/.. _BSD license: https://aioquic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/license.html.. _RFC 8446: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8446.. _RFC 9000: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000.. _RFC 9114: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9114</longdescription>

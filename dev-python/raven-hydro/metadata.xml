	<longdescription>Raven-hydro is a Python-based installer for the hydrologic modelling framework [Raven](http://raven.uwaterloo.ca/).- Free software: Apache Software License v2.0### About[Raven](http://raven.uwaterloo.ca) is a hydrological modeling framework that lets hydrologists build hydrological models by combining different hydrological processes together. It can also be used to emulate a variety of existing lumped and distributed models. Model structure, parameters, initial conditions and forcing files are configured in text files, which Raven parses to build and run hydrological simulations. A detailed description about modeling capability of Raven can be found in the [docs](https://www.civil.uwaterloo.ca/raven/files/v3.6/RavenManual_v3.6.pdf).### PurposeThe goal of this project is to provide a multiplatform installer for the Raven hydrological model using [scikit-build-core](https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build-core) and [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11). The compiled binary is built with support for [NetCDF4](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/), and uses a custom `CMakeLists.txt`, rather than the one provided with the [Raven source code](http://raven.uwaterloo.ca/Downloads.html), in order to leverage `pip` for handling the installation of binaries and libraries.This project differs from [RavenPy](https://github.com/CSHS-CWRA/RavenPy) by solely providing a means for downloading, compiling, and installing the Raven binary (with NetCDF4 support) on multiple platforms and as well as providing version control and updating via `pip`/PyPI.### Features- Download and/or compile the Raven hydrological model with `pip`- Multiplatform support (macOS, Linux, Windows, BSD, etc.)### Installation&gt; **Warning**&gt; By default, this build of Raven requires that NetCDF4 libraries are installed on the system, exposed on the `$PATH`, and discoverable using the `FindNetCDF.cmake` helper script.&gt;&gt; On Linux, this can be provided by the `libnetcdf-dev` system library; On macOS by the `netcdf` homebrew package; And on Windows by using UNIDATA's [pre-built binaries](https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf-c/current/winbin.html).&gt;&gt; This can also be provided by the `libnetcdf` package available at [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/libnetcdf), though this is not guaranteed to work on macOS at time of writing (further research required).`raven-hydro` can be installed from PyPI using the following command:```shell$ pip install raven-hydro```To install `raven-hydro` from PyPI **without NetCDF support**:```shell$ pip install raven-hydro -Ccmake.define.USE_NETCDF=false```For development purposes, we recommend cloning the repository and performing an `--editable` installation:```shell$ git clone git@github.com:Ouranosinc/raven-hydro$ cd raven-hydro$ pip install --editable .```</longdescription>

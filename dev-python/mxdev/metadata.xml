	<longdescription>========================================================================Mixed development source packages on top of stable constraints using pip========================================================================``mxdev`` [mɪks dɛv] is a utility that makes it easy to work with Python projects containing lots of packages, of which you only want to develop some.It builds on top of the idea to have stable version constraints and then develop from a VCS on top of it.As part of above use-case sometimes versions of the stable constraints need an override with a different (i.e. newer) version.Other software following the same idea are `mr.developer &lt;https://pypi.org/project/mr.developer/&gt;`_  for Python's ``zc.buildout`` or `mrs-developer &lt;https://www.npmjs.com/package/mrs-developer&gt;`_ for NPM packages.**mxdev 2.0 needs pip version 22 at minimum to work properly**Overview========mxdev procedure is:1. Configuration is read,2. Requirements and constraints (given in configuration) are read.3. Sources from VCS are fetched into a target directory,4. Modified constraints (handled packages commented, overridden versions replaced) and  requirements (handled packages as editable from sources) are written.mxdev will **not** run *pip* for you!Configuration=============Given a ``requirements.txt`` (or similar named) file which itself references a ``constraints.txt`` file inside.Create an INI file, like `mxdev.ini` in `configparser.ExtendedInterpolation &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#configparser.ExtendedInterpolation&gt;`_ syntax.Main section ``[settings]``---------------------------The **main section** must be called ``[settings]``, even if kept empty.In the main sections the input and output files are defined.``requirements-in``    Main requirements file to start with. This can be an URL too.    If given an empty value mxdev will only generate output from the information given in INI file itself.    Default: ``requirements.txt````requirements-out``    Output of the combined requirements including development sources to be used later with ``pip install``. Default: ``requirements-mxdev.txt````constraints-out``    Output of the combined constraints. Default: ``constraints-mxdev.txt````default-target``    Target directory for sources from VCS. Default: ``./sources````default-install-mode``    Default for ``install-mode`` on section, read there for details    Allowed values: ``direct`` or ``skip``    Default: ``direct````version-overrides``    Override package versions which already defined in a dependent constraints file.    I.e. an upstream *constraints.txt* contains already ``somefancypackage==2.0.3``.    Given, for some reason (like with my further developed sources), we need version 3.0.0 of above package.    Then in this section this can be defined as:    .. code-block:: ini        [settings]        version-overrides =            somefancypackage==3.0.0            otherpackage==33.12.1    It is possible to add as many overrides as needed.    When writing the *constraints-out*, the new version will be taken into account.    If there is a source-section defined for the same package, the source will be used and entries here are ignored.``ignores``    Ignore packages which are already defined in a dependent constraints file.    No new version will be provided.    This is specifically handy if a package is going to be installed editable from local file system (like ``-e .``), but was already pinned in an upstream constraints-file.    This can be defined as:    .. code-block:: ini        [settings]        ignores =            somefancypackage            otherpackageAdditional, custom variables can be defined as ``key = value`` pair.Those can be referenced in other values as ``${settings:key}`` and will be expanded there.Subsequent package source sections----------------------------------All other sections are defining the sources to be used.``[PACKAGENAME]``    The section name is the package name.``url = URL``    the URL to the source in VCS and must follow the `pip install editable &lt;https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#local-project-installs&gt;`_ format.    Attention, this differs from the format one copies from Github/Gitlab, etc.    For convienince *mxdev* applies auto-correction for this common cases:    - ``ssh://`` -&gt; ``git+ssh://``    - ``git@`` -&gt; ``git+ssh://git@``    - ``https://`` -&gt; ``git+https://``    The URL is required.``branch = BRANCHNAME_OR_TAG``    the branch name or tag to checkout.    Defaults to `main`.``extras = EXTRA1,EXTRA2``     Package extras to install. Default empty.``subdirectory = SUBPATH``      For specifying the path to the Python package, when it is not in the root of the VCS directory.      Default empty.``target``    Target directory for source from this section.    Default to default target directory configured in main section ``[settings]`` ``default-target =`` value.``install-mode``    There are different modes of pip installation:    ``skip``        Do not install with pip, just clone/update the repository.    ``direct``        Install the package using ``pip -e PACKAGEPATH``.        Dependencies are resolved immediately.    Defaults to default mode configured in main section ``[settings]`` ``default-install-mode =`` value.Usage=====Run ``mxdev -c mxdev.ini``.Mxdev will **read** the configuration, **fetch** the packages defined in the config file and **write** a requirements and constraints file.Now, use the generated requirements and constraints files with i.e. ``pip install -r requirements-mxdev.txt``.For more options run ``mxdev --help``.Example Configuration=====================Example ``mxdev.ini``---------------------This looks like so:.. code-block:: ini    [settings]    requirements-in = requirements.txt    requirements-out = requirements-mxdev.txt    contraints-out = constraints-mxdev.txt    version-overrides =        baz.baaz = 1.9.32    ignores =        my.ignoredpackage    # custom variables    github = git+ssh://git@github.com/    mygit = git+ssh://git@git.kup.tirol/    [foo.bar]    url = ${settings:github}orga/foo.bar.git    branch = fix99    extras = test,baz    [kup.fancyproject]    url = ${settings:mygit}customers/fancycorp/kup.fancyproject.git    branch = fix99    extras = test,bazExamples at GitHub------------------- `&quot;new&quot; plone.org backend &lt;https://github.com/plone/plone.org/tree/main/backend&gt;`_- (add more)Extending=========Functionality of mxdev can be extended by hooks.This is useful to generate additional scripts or files or automate any other setup steps related to mxdev's domain.Extension configuration settings end up in the ``mxdev.ini`` file.They can be added globally to the ``settings`` section, as dedicated config sections or package specific.To avoid naming conflicts, all hook related settings and config sections must be prefixed with a namespace.It is recommended to use the package name containing the hook as namespace.This looks like so:.. code-block:: ini    [settings]    myextension-global_setting = 1    [myextension-section]    setting = value    [foo.bar]    myextension-package_setting = 1The extension is implemented as subclass of ``mxdev.Hook``:.. code-block:: python    from mxdev import Hook    from mxdev import State    class MyExtension(Hook):        namespace = None        &quot;&quot;&quot;The namespace for this hook.&quot;&quot;&quot;        def read(self, state: State) -&gt; None:            &quot;&quot;&quot;Gets executed after mxdev read operation.&quot;&quot;&quot;        def write(self, state: State) -&gt; None:            &quot;&quot;&quot;Gets executed after mxdev write operation.&quot;&quot;&quot;The default settings section from the INI file is available at ``state.configuration.settings``.The package configuration is available at ``state.configuration.packages``.Hook related config sections are available at ``state.configuration.hooks``.The hook must be registered as entry point in the ``setup.py`` or ``setup.cfg`` of your package:.. code-block:: python    setup(        name='myextension',        ...        entry_points={            'mxdev': [                'hook = myextension:MyExtension',            ]        }    )Rationale=========Problem    There is a constraint file like ``-c constraints.txt`` with a package ``foo.bar`` with a version pin.    Then it is not possible to install this package in a requirements file editable like ``-r requirements.txt`` with ``-e git+ssh://git@github.com/orga/foo.bar.git@fix-99``.    Neither it is possible to override inherited version constraints with custom ones.Idea    A pre-processor fetches (as this can be an URL) and expands all ``-c SOMEOTHER_FILE_OR_URL`` and ``-r SOMEOTHER_FILE_OR_URL`` files into one, filtering out all packages given in a configuration file.    For each of those packages a ``-e ...`` entry is generated instead and written to a new ``TARGET.txt``.    Same is true for version overrides: a new entry is written to the resulting constraints file while the original version is disabled.    The configuration is read from a file ``mxdev.ini`` in *ExtendedInterpolation* INI syntax (YAML would be nice, but the package must have as less dependencies as possible to other packages).Trivia    Mx (generally pronounced like mix [mɪks], or [məks] in the UK) is meant to be a gender-neutral alternative to the titles Mr. and Ms. but also associates with mix.Changes=======2.1.0 (2022-05-19)------------------- Fixed incompatibility with libvcs 0.12+.  [maurits]- Config parser options are now considered case sensitive.  [rnix]- Do not fail ``mxdev`` run if ``requirements.txt`` is missing.  [rnix]- Add flag to only fetch repositories an skip generating files.  [rnix]- Add flag to skip fetching of repositories.  [rnix]- Add support for custom hooks.  [rnix]- Rename sources.ini to mxdev.ini in documentation.  [rnix]- Introduce state object and pass it to read/fetch/write. State object  contains all required runtime data.  [rnix]2.0.0 (2022-01-31)------------------- Depend on pip 22, where interdependency mode is no longer needed.  Remove all interdependency related code.  [jensens]- Better error message if the requirements-in file does not exists.  [jensens]- Better last message with the full pip command.  [jensens]- Allow empty ``requirements-in`` configuration.  [jensens]1.1.0 (2021-12-29)------------------- Feature: Ignore existing constraints.  New setting ``ignores`` with a list of packages (one per line) to ignore from constraints without providing a version.  [jensens]1.0.1 (2021-12-21)------------------- Fix: If a developed package depends on another developed package the dependent package was ignored *sometimes* (!?).  Instead the last release was taken.  Solution: Install it with the `--pre` option in order allow the other non-final/in-development *release*.  [jensens]1.0.0 (2021-12-12)------------------- Defaults for &quot;outfiles&quot; are ``*-mxdev.txt`` now.  [jensens]1.0.0b4 (2021-12-07)--------------------- Fix interdependency mode.  [jensens]1.0.0b3 (2021-12-07)--------------------- Fix: Do not apply override disabling on requirements.  [jensens]1.0.0b2 (2021-12-07)--------------------- Add feature: version overrides.  [jensens]1.0.0b1 (2021-12-04)--------------------- Add ``-s`` or ``--silent`` option.  [jensens]- Beautified output.  [jensens]- Fixed missing CR if ``*.txt`` does not end with newline.  [jensens]1.0.0a9 (2021-12-01)--------------------- Added auto correction for pip URLs, so that GitHub or Gitlab URLs can be used as copied in `sources.ini`.  [zworkb]1.0.0a8 (2021-11-30)--------------------- Added interdependency handling to avoid manual dependency order resolution.  [jensens, gogobd]- Added skip mode to exclude packages from installation (clone/update only).  [jensens, gogobd]- Removed position feature.  [jensens, gogobd]1.0.0a7 (2021-11-30)--------------------- Removed Workaround for libvcs and depend on libvcs&gt;=0.10.1.  [jensens]1.0.0a6 (2021-11-30)--------------------- Workaround for libvcs bug https://github.com/vcs-python/libvcs/issues/295  [jensens, gogobd]1.0.0a5 (2021-11-30)--------------------- Workaround for libvcs bug https://github.com/vcs-python/libvcs/issues/293  [jensens, gogobd]1.0.0a4 (2021-11-29)--------------------- Fix: editable can be configured to be processed before or after initial requirements.  [jensens]1.0.0a3 (2021-11-23)--------------------- Fix #1: Re-run of pip vanishes committed changes  [jensens]1.0.0a2 (2021-11-21)--------------------- Fix/simplify packaging.

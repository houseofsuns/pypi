It provides a status page for each such task, whichincludes a meaningful progress indicator if the task is currently beingexecuted and provides any appropriate text and/or links for output once thetask is complete.In Open edX, such tasks include operations such as exporting or importing acourse, sending an email to all the students in a course, uploading a video,and other tasks which often take too long to perform during a single webrequest (as outlined in `OEP-3`_).  However, this has been written with theintention of being useful in a variety of Django projects outside the Open edXplatform as well.Note that this library was created as a consolidation of lessons learned fromimplementing such tasks in various parts of the Open edX code base.  Theydon't yet all use this library, but the plan is to over time refactor many ofthem to do so... _OEP-3: https://open-edx-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oeps/oep-0003.htmlOverview--------django-user-tasks is currently a wrapper for `Celery`_ (although the hope isthat it could also be extended to also support `channels`_ and otherasynchronous task queues).  By extending the provided ``UserTask`` class (oradding ``UserTaskMixin`` to an existing Task subclass) and providing a``user_id`` task argument, the task's status is stored in a database tableseparate from the Celery broker and result store.  This ``UserTaskStatus``model allows for full database queries of the tasks that users are most likelyto care about while not imposing any restrictions on the Celery configurationmost appropriate for the site's overall needs for asynchronous taskprocessing.Most of the status updating is handled automatically via Celery's `signals`_mechanism, but it can be enhanced by:* Overriding the ``UserTaskMixin`` methods such as ``generate_name`` and  ``calculate_total_steps`` for particular types of tasks* Calling some of the ``UserTaskStatus`` methods like  ``increment_completed_steps`` and ``set_state`` from the task implementation* Saving task output as instances of the ``UserTaskArtifact`` model.. _Celery: http://www.celeryproject.org/.. _channels: https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.. _signals: http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/signals.htmlDocumentation-------------The full documentation is at https://django-user-tasks.readthedocs.org.License-------The code in this repository is licensed under the Apache Software License 2.0 unlessotherwise noted.Please see ``LICENSE.txt`` for details.How To Contribute-----------------Contributions are very welcome.Please read `How To Contribute &lt;https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst&gt;`_ for details.Even though they were written with ``edx-platform`` in mind, the guidelinesshould be followed for Open edX code in general.Reporting Security Issues-------------------------Please do not report security issues in public.

All enhancements and patches to django-user-tasks will be documented   in this file.  It adheres to the structure of http://keepachangelog.com/ ,   but in reStructuredText instead of Markdown (for ease of incorporation into   Sphinx documentation and the PyPI description).   This project adheres to Semantic Versioning (http://semver.org/)... There should always be an &quot;Unreleased&quot; section for changes pending release.Unreleased~~~~~~~~~~Removed+++++++* Removed Python 3.5 support.Chore+++++* Upgraded celery to latest 5.x version.[2.2.0] - 2022-01-26~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Removed+++++++* Removed Django22,30,31 support.Added+++++* Added Django40 support in CI[2.1.0] - 2021-07-07~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Added+++++* Support for django3.0, 3.1 and 3.2[2.0.3] - 2021-06-08~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Changed+++++++* Fixed django admin timeout issue.[2.0.2] - 2021-05-28~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Changed+++++++* Fixed minor issue.

New import is compatible with 4.4.7 also.[1.3.1] - 2020-11-23~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Added+++++* Added support for Django REST Framework 3.10.x through 3.12.x[1.3.0] - 2020-08-25~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Added+++++* Added support for celery 4[1.2.0] - 2020-08-20~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Removed+++++++* Removed code related to Python 2[1.1.0] - 2020-05-07~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Added+++++++* Added support for python 3.8Removed+++++++* Dropped support for Django &lt; 2.2[1.0.0] - 2020-03-18~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Removed+++++++* Dropped Python 2.7 support[0.3.0] - 2019-12-15~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Added+++++* Added support for Django 2.2[0.2.1] - 2019-09-25~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Changed+++++++* `start_user_task` should only close obsolete connections if the current connection is NOT in an atomic block  (which fixes errors on devstack studio/course-publishing).[0.2.0] - 2019-08-30~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Changed+++++++* Have the `start_user_task` receiver close obsolete connections before starting the task.[0.1.9] - 2019-08-27~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Changed+++++++* Fix issue with `UserTaskArtifactAdmin` and `UserTaskStatusAdmin` where `ordering` attribute must be a tuple or list.[0.1.8] - 2019-08-22~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Changed+++++++* Improve list display for `ModelAdmin`.[0.1.7] - 2019-05-29~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Changed+++++++* Make ``UserTaskArtifact.url`` a ``TextField`` with a ``URLValidator``  instead of a ``URLField``.[0.1.6] - 2019-05-29~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Changed+++++++* Upgrade requirements.* Change ``max_length`` of ``UserTaskArtifact.url`` from 200 to 512.[0.1.5] - 2017-08-03~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Changed+++++++* Added testing/support for Django 1.11.[0.1.4] - 2017-01-30~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Changed+++++++* Slightly improved handling of tasks which start before their status records  are committed (due to database transactions).  Also documented how to avoid  this problem in the first place.[0.1.3] - 2017-01-03~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Changed+++++++* Tasks which were explicitly canceled, failed, or retried no longer have  their status changed to ``Succeeded`` just because the task exited cleanly.* Celery tasks which fail to import cleanly by name (because they use a custom  name which isn't actually the fully qualified task name) are now just ignored  in the ``before_task_publish`` signal handler.[0.1.2] - 2016-12-05~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Changed+++++++* Add a migration to explicitly reference the setting for artifact file storage.  This setting is likely to vary between installations, but doesn't affect the  generated database schema.  This change should prevent ``makemigrations``  from creating a new migration whenever the setting value changes.[0.1.1] - 2016-10-11~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Changed+++++++* Fix Travis configuration for PyPI deployments.* Switch from the Read the Docs Sphinx theme to the Open edX one for documentation.[0.1.0] - 2016-10-07~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Added+++++* First attempt to release on PyPI.</longdescription>

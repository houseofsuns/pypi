	<longdescription>.. _readme:`Quick Example`_----------------install dlcli using pip.. code-block:: none    pip install dlcliset your org, account and api key by creating ~/dlcli.yaml.. code-block:: none    ---    account: account_name    key: key_from_account_settings    org: orgname    url: https://api.outlyer.com/v1Or you can update the file interactively... code-block:: none    dlcli set org acme-ltd.. code-block:: none    dlcli set account staging.. code-block:: none    dlcli set key xxxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxthese get stored in ~/dlcli.yaml so the details only need to be changed when you are switching orgs or accountsnow verify you have a successful connection.. code-block:: none    dlcli statusthen get a list of all of your agents.. code-block:: none    dlcli get agentsfun! this is a work in progress so if you want to collaborate please raise PR's`Dataloop CLI Tool`_--------------------dlcli commands can be thought of as a series of nested commands, with each stage having its own options and flags... code-block:: none    dlcli [FLAGS] COMMAND [FLAGS] SUBCOMMAND [FLAGS]The square braces indicate optional elements. Some commands have flags, some do not. Some of those flags are optional, some are mandatory per the command. See the list of commands and flags for more information.The first thing to know is that help is never far away. You can use the ``--help`` flag at any stage to discover which flags are available:.. code-block:: none    dlcli --help.. code-block:: none    dlcli COMMAND --help.. code-block:: none    dlcli COMMAND SUBCOMMAND --helpUnderstand that using the ``--help`` flag in between two nested commands will result in the previous level ``--help`` output being shown.``dlcli --help`` COMMAND will have the same output as ``dlcli --help``, and likewise, ``dlcli COMMAND --help SUBCOMMAND`` will have the same output as ``dlcli COMMAND --help``.The top-level help output looks like this:.. code-block:: none    $ dlcli --help    Usage: dlcli [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...    Dataloop Command Line Tool    See https://www.dataloop.io    Options:    --debug            Debug mode    --loglevel TEXT    Log level    --logfile TEXT     log file    --version          Show the version and exit.    --help             Show this message and exit.    Commands:    agents      Dataloop AgentsNote that all available flags and commands for this level are shown. This pattern is repeated at each successive level of ``--help```Using the API outside of dlcli`_---------------------------------You can use the API code outside of the command line utility... code-block:: python    from dlcli import api        settings = {        'url': 'https://api.outlyer.com/v1',        'org': 'org_name',        'account': 'account_name',        'key': 'api_key',    }        print api.agents.get_agents(**settings)    Where org_name, account_name and api_key need to be updated with your personal settings.</longdescription>

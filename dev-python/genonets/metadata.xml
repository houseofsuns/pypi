A previous version based on Python 2 was used as the backend for the [Genonets Server](#Genonets-Server-end-of-life).## DocumentationInstallation and usage instructions, as well as further documentation is available [here](https://genonets.readthedocs.io/).## Genonets Server end-of-lifeThe Genonets Server had to be shut down due to lack of funding for web hosting services. Nevertheless, all analyses are still available in the Genonets package via this repository.## Contact**Note:** Please [email us](mailto:genonets@outlook.com) for any questions and/or comments.</longdescription>

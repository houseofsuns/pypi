This software facilitates working with signals for tasks such as heartbeat detection, heartbeat classification, and arrhythmia classification. Utilizing it, researchers can focus on these tasks without the burden of designing data processing modules. The package transforms original data into processed signal excerpts and their computed features in order to be used for training various machine learning models including advanced deep learning models, which can be trained by taking advantage of Keras and Tensorflow libraries.## DocumentationDocumentation is available at the link below.[pyheartlib.readthedocs.io](https://pyheartlib.readthedocs.io).## RequirementsCurrent version of the package was tested on:- Ubuntu: 20.04 | 22.04 &amp; Python: 3.10 | 3.11- macOS: 12.6.9 | 13.6 &amp; Python: 3.10 | 3.11## InstallationThe package can be installed with pip:```bash$ pip install pyheartlib```## ExamplesExamples can be found in the [examples section](https://pyheartlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/examples.html) of the documentation and also in the GitHub repository ([examples](examples/)).## ContributingFeedback and contributions are appreciated.

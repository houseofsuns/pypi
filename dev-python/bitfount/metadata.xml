For a pinned version of these requirements which are guaranteed to work, run the following command instead:`pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt`To be able to use differential privacy (DP), you will need to additionally install the DP requirements:`pip install -r requirements/differential_privacy/requirements-dp.txt`For MacOS you also need to install `libomp`:`brew install libomp`### Getting started (Tutorials)In order to run the tutorials, you also need to install the tutorial requirements:`pip install -r requirements/requirements-tutorial.txt`To get started using the Bitfount package in a federated setting,we recommend that you start with our tutorials. Run `jupyter notebook`and open up the first tutorial at: `tutorials/01_running_a_pod.ipynb`### Federated training scriptsSome simple scripts have been provided to run a Pod or Modelling job from a config file.&gt; ⚠️ If you are running from a source install (such as from `git clone`) you will&gt; need to use &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: nowrap&quot;&gt;`python -m scripts.&lt;script_name&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&gt; rather than use `bitfount &lt;script_name&gt;` directly.To run a pod:`bitfount run_pod --path_to_config_yaml=&lt;CONFIG_FILE&gt;`To run a modelling job:`bitfount run_modeller --path_to_config_yaml=&lt;CONFIG_FILE&gt;`### Basic Local UsageAs well as providing the ability to use data in remote pods, this package also enables local ML training. Some example code for this purpose is given below.**1\. Import bitfount**```pythonimport bitfount as bf```**2\. Create DataSource and load data**```pythoncensus_income = bf.CSVSource(    path=&quot;https://bitfount-hosted-downloads.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/bitfount-tutorials/census_income.csv&quot;,    ignore_cols=[&quot;fnlwgt&quot;],)census_income.load_data()```**3\. Create Schema**```pythonschema = bf.BitfountSchema(    census_income,    table_name=&quot;census_income&quot;,    force_stypes={        &quot;census_income&quot;: {            &quot;categorical&quot;:[                &quot;TARGET&quot;,                &quot;workclass&quot;,                &quot;marital-status&quot;,                &quot;occupation&quot;,                &quot;relationship&quot;,                &quot;race&quot;,                &quot;native-country&quot;,                &quot;gender&quot;,                &quot;education&quot;            ]        }    })```**4\. Transform Data**```pythonclean_data = bf.CleanDataTransformation()processor = bf.TransformationProcessor([clean_data], schema.get_table_schema(&quot;census_income&quot;))census_income.data = processor.transform(census_income.data)schema.add_datasource_tables(census_income, table_name=&quot;census_income&quot;)```**5\. Create DataStructure**```pythoncensus_income_data_structure=bf.DataStructure(  table=&quot;census_income&quot;,  target=&quot;TARGET&quot;,)```**6\. Create and Train Model**```pythonnn = bf.PyTorchTabularClassifier(    datastructure=census_income_data_structure,    schema=schema,    epochs=2,    batch_size=256,    optimizer=bf.Optimizer(&quot;RAdam&quot;, {&quot;lr&quot;: 0.001}),)nn.fit(census_income)nn.serialize(&quot;demo_task_model.pt&quot;)```**7\. Evaluate**```pythonpreds, target = nn.evaluate()metrics = bf.MetricCollection.create_from_model(nn)results = metrics.compute(target, preds)print(results)```**8\. Assert results**```pythonimport numpy as npassert nn._validation_results[-1][&quot;validation_loss&quot;] is not np.nanassert results[&quot;AUC&quot;] &gt; 0.7```## LicenseThe license for this software is available in the `LICENSE` file.This can be found in the Github Repository, as well as inside the Docker image.</longdescription>

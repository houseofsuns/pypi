	<longdescription># Extended JSON Schema validator, Python editionThis library and program validates both JSON Schema and JSON-like contents.The contents can be physically represented either as JSON or as YAML files.The JSON schemas should be compliant with JSON Schema versions supportedby the installed [`jsonschema`](https://python-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library.As of version 4.16 they are Draft04, Draft06, Draft07, Draft2019-09 and Draft2020-12 specifications.The installation instructions are in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) .## HistoryThe roots of this code come from [https://github.com/inab/benchmarking-data-model/tree/0.4.0/toolsForValidation](https://github.com/inab/benchmarking-data-model/tree/0.4.0/toolsForValidation).Its development was later followed at [https://github.com/fairtracks/fairtracks_validator/], where implementations in other programming languages were also hosted. Python code gained traction and real modularisation there.As this Python code is relevant to several research projects, it has been split from its latest repo, keeping the core and original extensions here at [https://github.com/inab/python-extended-json-schema-validator](https://github.com/inab/python-extended-json-schema-validator), and keeping specific FAIRTracks extensions at [https://github.com/fairtracks/fairtracks_validator_python](https://github.com/fairtracks/fairtracks_validator_python).## ExtensionsA description of the base JSON Schema extensions implemented in this repository is available at [README-extensions.md](README-extensions.md).## Usage```bashpython jsonValidate.py --help# or if the package was installed through pypiext-json-validate -h``````usage: jsonValidate.py [-h] [--log-file LOGFILENAME] [--log-format LOGFORMAT] [-q] [-v] [-d] [-C CONFIGFILENAME]                       [--cache-dir CACHEDIR] [-c] [--schema_id_path SCHEMA_ID_PATH]                       [--guess-schema | --use-schemas USE_SCHEMAS [USE_SCHEMAS ...]] [--fix]                       [--report REPORTFILENAME] [--annotation ANNOTREPORT] [--verbose-report] [--error-report]                       [--dot-report FILENAME TITLE] [--invalidate | --read-only] [--warm-up | --lazy-load]                       [--iter-arrays] [-V]                       json_schema_or_dir [json_file_or_dir [json_file_or_dir ...]]Validate JSON against JSON Schemas with extensions (version 0.12.3)positional arguments:  json_schema_or_dir    The JSON Schema, either in JSON or YAML file format, or directory with them to validate                        and use  json_file_or_dir      The JSONs, either in JSON or YAML file formats, or directories with them to be validated                        (default: None)optional arguments:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  --log-file LOGFILENAME                        Store messages in a file instead of using standard error and standard output (default:                        None)  --log-format LOGFORMAT                        Format of log messages (default: %(asctime)-15s - [%(levelname)s] %(message)s)  -q, --quiet           Only show engine warnings and errors (default: None)  -v, --verbose         Show verbose (informational) messages (default: None)  -d, --debug           Show debug messages (use with care, as it could potentially disclose sensitive contents)                        (default: None)  -C CONFIGFILENAME, --config CONFIGFILENAME                        Configuration file (used by extensions) in YAML format (default: None)  --cache-dir CACHEDIR  Caching directory (used by extensions) (default: None)  -c, --continue        Show all the error messages instead of stopping on the first one (default when a report                        file is requested) (default: False)  --schema_id_path SCHEMA_ID_PATH                        When the content read from the file is going to be validated, JSON Path (accepted by                        jsonpath-ng) used to get the schema id which identifies the schema to be used by the                        validator (default: &quot;@schema&quot;|&quot;_schema&quot;|&quot;$schema&quot;)  --guess-schema        Try to validate the input JSONs against all the loaded schemas (default: False)  --use-schemas USE_SCHEMAS [USE_SCHEMAS ...]                        Try to validate the input JSONs against any of the loaded schemas matching these URIs                        (default: None)  --fix                 When some validation error arises, an editor instance (from $EDITOR environment variable)                        is launched giving the chance to fix the files, and then it is validated again.

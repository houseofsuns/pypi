This task is performed using neural networks applieda pileup of individual sequencing reads against a draft assembly. It providesstate-of-the-art results outperforming sequence-graph based methods andsignal-based methods, whilst also being faster.© 2018- Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd.Features--------  * Requires only basecalled data. (`.fasta` or `.fastq`)  * Improved accuracy over graph-based methods (e.g. Racon).  * 50X faster than Nanopolish (and can run on GPUs).  * Includes extras for implementing and training bespoke correction    networks.  * Works on Linux and MacOS.  * Open source (Mozilla Public License 2.0).For creating draft assemblies we recommend [Flye](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye).Installation------------Medaka can be installed in one of several ways.**Installation with conda**Perhaps the simplest way to start using medaka isthrough conda; medaka is available via the[bioconda](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/medaka) channel:    conda create -n medaka -c conda-forge -c bioconda medakaOccasionally the conda releases lag behind the source code and[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/medaka/) releases.**Installation with pip**For those who prefer Python's native pacakage manager, medaka is also availableon pypi and can be installed using pip:    pip install medakaOn Linux platforms this will install a precompiled binary, on MacOS (and other)platforms this will fetch and compile a source distribution.We recommend using medaka within a virtual environment, viz.:    virtualenv medaka --python=python3 --prompt &quot;(medaka) &quot;    . medaka/bin/activate    pip install medakaUsing this method requires the user to provide several binaries: * [samtools](https://github.com/samtools/samtools), * [minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2), * [tabix](https://github.com/samtools/htslib), and * [bgzip](https://github.com/samtools/htslib)and place these within the `PATH`. `samtools/bgzip/tabix` version 1.14 and`minimap2` version 2.17 are recommended as these are those used in developmentof medaka.**Installation from source**&gt; This method is useful for macOS M1 devices as it will assist in building&gt; dependencies which will fail with the other methods above.Medaka can be installed from its source quite easily on most systems. Before installing medaka it may be required to install some prerequisite libraries, best installed by a package manager. On Ubuntu theses are: &gt;     bzip2 g++ zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev liblzma-dev libffi-dev libncurses5-dev &gt;     libcurl4-gnutls-dev libssl-dev curl make cmake wget python3-all-dev &gt;     python-virtualenv In addition it is required to install and set up git LFS before cloning the repository.A Makefile is provided to fetch, compile and install all direct dependenciesinto a python virtual environment. To set-up the environment run:    # Note: certain files are stored in git-lfs, https://git-lfs.github.com/,    #       which must therefore be installed first.    git clone https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka.git    cd medaka    make install    . ./venv/bin/activateUsing this method both `samtools` and `minimap2` are built from source and neednot be provided by the user.**Using a GPU**Since version 1.1.0 `medaka` uses Tensorflow 2.2, prior versions used Tensorflow 1.4.For `medaka` 1.1.0 and higher installation from source or using `pip` can makeimmediate use of GPUs. However, note that the `tensorflow` package is compiled againstspecific versions of the NVIDIA CUDA and cuDNN libraries; users are directed to the[tensorflow installation](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#gpu) pagesfor further information. cuDNN can be obtained from the[cuDNN Archive](https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive), whilst CUDAfrom the [CUDA Toolkit Archive](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive).For `medaka` prior to version 1.1.0, to enable the use of GPU resource it isnecessary to install the `tensorflow-gpu` package. Using the source code from githuba working GPU-powered `medaka` can be configured with:    # Note: certain files are stored in git-lfs, https://git-lfs.github.com/,    #       which must therefore be installed first.    git clone https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka.git    cd medaka    sed -i 's/tensorflow/tensorflow-gpu/' requirements.txt    make install    *GPU Usage notes*Depending on your GPU, `medaka` may show out of memory errors when running.To avoid these the inference batch size can be reduced from the defaultvalue by setting the `-b` option when running `medaka_consensus`. A value`-b 100` is suitable for 11Gb GPUs.For users with RTX series GPUs it may be required to additionally set anenvironment variable to have `medaka` run without failure:    export TF_FORCE_GPU_ALLOW_GROWTH=trueIn this situation a further reduction in batch size may be required.**Using Docker**The source code repository contains a `Dockerfile` which can be used to createa GPU compatible Docker container image with the appropriate CUDA and cuDNNlibrary versions for running medaka. The image is built on top of images[provided by NVIDIA](https://hub.docker.com/r/nvidia/cuda) designed to run with the [NVIDIA ContainerToolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html).With the toolkit setup on your host computer the following command can be usedto run the latest version of medaka:    docker run --rm --gpus 0 ontresearch/medaka:latest medaka --help(The `--gpus` option can be amended as appropriate for your environment). Versionedtags are also available.Usage-----`medaka` can be run using its default settings through the `medaka_consensus`program. An assembly in `.fasta` format and basecalls in `.fasta` or `.fastq`formats are required. The program uses both `samtools` and `minimap2`. Ifmedaka has been installed using the from-source method these will be presentwithin the medaka environment, otherwise they will need to be provided bythe user.    source ${MEDAKA}  # i.e. medaka/venv/bin/activate    NPROC=$(nproc)    BASECALLS=basecalls.fa    DRAFT=draft_assm/assm_final.fa    OUTDIR=medaka_consensus    medaka_consensus -i ${BASECALLS} -d ${DRAFT} -o ${OUTDIR} -t ${NPROC} -m r941_min_high_g303The variables `BASECALLS`, `DRAFT`, and `OUTDIR` in the above should be setappropriately. For the selection of the model (`-m r941_min_high_g303` in theexample above) see the Model section following.When `medaka_consensus` has finished running, the consensus will be saved to`${OUTDIR}/consensus.fasta`.**Bacterial (ploidy-1) variant calling**Variant calling for monoploid samples is enabled through the `medaka_haploid_variant`workflow:    medaka_haploid_variant -i &lt;reads.fastq&gt; -r &lt;ref.fasta&gt;    which requires the reads as a `.fasta` or `.fastq` and a reference sequence as a`.fasta` file.**Diploid variant calling**The diploid variant calling workflow `medaka_variant` that was historically implementedwithin the medaka package has been surpassed in accuracy and compute performance byother methods, it has therefore been deprecated. Our current recommendation forperforming this task is to use [Clair3](https://github.com/HKU-BAL/Clair3) either directlyor through the Oxford Nanopore Technologies provided Nextflow implementation availablethrough [EPI2ME Labs](https://labs.epi2me.io/wfindex#variant-calling).Models------For best results it is important to specify the correct model, `-m` in theabove, according to the basecaller used. Allowed values can be found byrunning `medaka tools list\_models`.Medaka models are named to indicate i) the pore type, ii) the sequencingdevice (MinION or PromethION), iii) the basecaller variant, and iv) thebasecaller version, with the format:    {pore}_{device}_{caller variant}_{caller version}For example the model named `r941_min_fast_g303` should be used with data fromMinION (or GridION) R9.4.1 flowcells using the fast Guppy basecaller version3.0.3. By contrast the model `r941_prom_hac_g303` should be used with PromethIONdata and the high accuracy basecaller (termed &quot;hac&quot; in Guppy configurationfiles). Where a version of Guppy has been used without an exactly correspondingmedaka model, the medaka model with the highest version equal to or less thanthe guppy version should be selected.Improving parallelism---------------------The `medaka_consensus` program is good for simple datasets but perhaps notoptimal for running large datasets at scale. A higher level of parallelismcan be achieved by running independently the component steps of`medaka_consensus`. The program performs three tasks:1. alignment of reads to input assembly (via `mini_align` which is a thin   veil over `minimap2`)2. running of consensus algorithm across assembly regions   (`medaka consensus`, note no underscore!)3. aggregation of the results of 2. to create consensus sequences   (`medaka stitch`)The three steps are discrete, and can be split apart and run independently. Inmost cases, Step 2. is the bottleneck and can be trivially parallelized. The`medaka consensus` program can be supplied a `--regions`argument which will restrict its action to particular assembly sequences fromthe `.bam` file output in Step 1. Therefore individual jobs can be run for batchesof assembly sequences simultaneously. In the final step, `medaka stitch`can take as input one or more of the `.hdf` files output by Step 2.So in summary something like this is possible:.. code-block:: bash    # align reads to assembly    mini_align -i basecalls.fasta -r assembly.fasta -P -m \        -p calls_to_draft.bam -t &lt;threads&gt;    # run lots of jobs like this, change model as appropriate    mkdir results    medaka consensus calls_to_draft.bam results/contigs1-4.hdf \        --model r941_min_fast_g303 --batch 200 --threads 8 \        --region contig1 contig2 contig3 contig4    ...    # wait for jobs, then collate results    medaka stitch results/*.hdf polished.assembly.fastaIt is not recommended to specify a value of `--threads` greater than 2 for`medaka consensus` since the compute scaling efficiency is poor beyond this.Note also that `medaka consensus` may been seen to use resources equivalent to`&lt;threads&gt; + 4` as an additional 4 threads are used for reading and preparinginput data.Origin of the draft sequence----------------------------Medaka has been trained to correct draft sequences output from the[Flye](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye) assembler.Processing a draft sequence from alternative sources (e.g. the output of[canu](https://github.com/marbl/canu) or[wtdbg2](https://github.com/ruanjue/wtdbg2)) may lead to different results.&gt; Historical correction&gt; models in medaka were trained to correct draft sequences output from the canu&gt; assembler with [racon](https://github.com/lbcb-sci/racon) applied either once,&gt; or four times iteratively. For contemporary models this is not the case and&gt; medaka should be used directly on the output of Flye.Acknowledgements----------------We thank [Joanna Pineda](https://github.com/jopineda) and[Jared Simpson](https://github.com/jts) for providing htslib code samples which aidedgreatly development of the optimised feature generation code, and for testing theversion 0.4 release candidates.We thank [Devin Drown](https://github.com/devindrown) for[working through](https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka/issues/70)use of `medaka` with his RTX 2080 GPU.Help----**Licence and Copyright**© 2018- Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd.`medaka` is distributed under the terms of the Mozilla Public License 2.0.**Research Release**Research releases are provided as technology demonstrators to provide earlyaccess to features or stimulate Community development of tools.

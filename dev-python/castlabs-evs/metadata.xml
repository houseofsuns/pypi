	<longdescription>`castlabs-evs` is a package that provides a client for the [EVS service](https://github.com/castlabs/electron-releases/wiki/EVS) for [Electron for Content Security](https://github.com/castlabs/electron-releases). EVS provides production Widevine/VMP signing of application packages derived from official releases of Electron for Content Security. It is a free service, but requires signup to use.As part of the Widevine 3PL program castLabs also offers [commercial VMP certification](https://github.com/castlabs/electron-releases/wiki/EVS#3pl) of custom Chromium/Electron adaptations, which enables the use of EVS for signing custom builds.`castlabs-evs` supports Python 3.7+ and can be installed with:```% python3 -m pip install castlabs-evs```This installs the EVS client which provides Python and CLI interfaces for account handling and VMP signing. If the pip module binary directory is in your `PATH` the two convenience scripts `evs-account` and `evs-vmp` can be used in place of `python3 -m &lt;module&gt;` in the examples below.The CLI interfaces are interactive by default, asking for any information they cannot load from its configuration, unless they are provided through CLI arguments or environment variables. This behaviour can be overridden by not providing a TTY on STDIN, or by passing the `--no-ask` option or setting EVS_NO_ASK in the environment, in which case any missing required information will trigger a runtime error instead, making them more suitable for automation.The Python interfaces are not currently documented, but the CLI provides help sections that can be accessed:```% python3 -m castlabs_evs.account --helpusage: account.py [-h] [-v] [-n]                  {signup,sup,resend,rs,confirm-signup,csup,update,up,reset,res,confirm-reset,cres,refresh,r,deauth,da,reauth,ra,delete,del}                  ...optional arguments:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit  -n, --no-ask          enable non-interactive modecommands:  {signup,sup,resend,rs,confirm-signup,csup,update,up,reset,res,confirm-reset,cres,refresh,r,deauth,da,reauth,ra,delete,del}    signup (sup)        sign up for EVS account    resend (rs)         resend EVS account confirmation code    confirm-signup (csup)                        confirm account signup    update (up)         update account details    reset (res)         reset account password    confirm-reset (cres)                        confirm account password reset    refresh (r)         refresh authorization tokens    deauth (da)         discard any authorization tokens    reauth (ra)         discard any authorization tokens &amp; refresh    delete (del)        delete EVS account``````% python3 -m castlabs_evs.vmp --helpusage: vmp.py [-h] [-v] [-n] [-a] {verify,v,sign,s,verify-pkg,vp,sign-pkg,sp} ...optional arguments:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit  -n, --no-ask          enable non-interactive mode  -a, --any-ski         verify any subject key identifiercommands:  {verify,v,sign,s,verify-pkg,vp,sign-pkg,sp}    verify (v)          verify signature    sign (s)            refresh signature    verify-pkg (vp)     verify electron package signature    sign-pkg (sp)       refresh electron package signature```# Legal notice / DisclaimerTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

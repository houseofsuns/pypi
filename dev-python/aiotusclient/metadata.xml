	<longdescription># tus.io uploader for Python asyncioaiotusclient is a fork of tus-py-client rewritten for Python asyncio and aiohttp.It is used to communicate with storage proxies that handle large transfers for vfolder uploads and downloads.## Package Structure* `aiotusclient`  - `client`: The client instance class which communicates between Backend.AI Manager  - `baseuploader` and `uploader`    - Responsible for chunking the file and asynchronously uploading to tus server  - `request`    - Handles the uploading request## Installation### Prequisites* Python 3.7 or higher with [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)and [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv) (optional but recommneded)### Installation ProcessFirst, prepare the source clone of this agent:```console# git clone https://github.com/lablup/aiotusclient```From now on, let's assume all shell commands are executed inside the virtualenv. And we located in backend.ai root directory.Now install dependencies:```console# pip install -U aiotusclient```When done, import into your code the aiotusclient```pythonfrom aiotusclient import clienttus_client = client.TusClient(session_create_url, session_upload_url, rqst.headers, params)```### ReferenceThis library was forked from [tus-py-client](https://github.com/tus/tus-py-client) and customized in order to facilitate asynchronous communication with our TUS server.</longdescription>

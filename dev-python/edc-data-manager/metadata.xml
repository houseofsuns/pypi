The ``Data Query``is then made available to research staff on the participant's dashboard and administrative pages. Additionally, the data managercan define ``Query Rules`` that scan the dataset for participant data that match the rule's criteria. For each match found,``edc-data-manager`` automatically creates a ``Data Query``.For automated queries, those created when a ``Query Rule`` is run, ``edc-data-manager`` will re-run a ``Query Rule`` upon updatesto the participant data. If the criteria is no longer met, the ``Data Query`` is automatically closed.User Roles==========``edc_data_manager`` adds the ``DATA MANAGER`` and the ``DATA_QUERY`` user groups.Members of the ``DATA_QUERY`` group can respond to existing data queries by completing  the &quot;site response&quot; section of the form.They do not have permissions to change the criteria of the data query. Research staff responsible for submitting participantdata are typically given membership to the ``DATA_QUERY`` user group.Members of the ``DATA MANAGER`` user group can add/change/delete any ``Data Query`` form and ``Query Rule`` form.Data managers, those who oversee data collection but do not submit data themselves, are typically members of the ``DATA MANAGER`` user group.The Data Query Model====================The central model of ``edc_data_manager`` is the ``Data Query`` model. A ``Data Query`` is either created manually by a data manageror automatically when a ``Query Rule`` is run. The ``data query`` describes an issue for the attention of the research staff.A data query might be general, describing the issue with nothing more than a free text comment, or specific. To allow for a specificdata query, the ``Query Rule`` form has questions where the data manager (or ``Query Rule``) can select the relevant timepoints, form questions,and timing.Data query status+++++++++++++++++The ``Data Query`` status is split between two fields, one managed by the research staff and one by the data manager. Initially theresearch staff status is set to ``New`` and the data manager's status is set to ``Open``.The available states of a ``Data Query`` are similar to those used on ticketing systems; namely, New, Open , Feedback, Resolved, Closed.Only a data manager can close a data query.Members of the ``DATA_QUERY`` group can:* Open the query -- indicating they are working on the issue. (``Open``)* Request feedback -- indicating they need assistance from the data manager .(``Feedback``)* Resolve the query -- indicating the issue is resolved. (``Resolved``)This status field, managed by members of the ``DATA_QUERY`` group, is in a seperate section of the ``Data Query`` form.Members of the ``DATA_MANAGER`` have their own section on the form and can:* Resolve the query (but only if the site status is also ``Resolved``)* Resolve with an action planSince data managers have full permissions to the form, they can override the status set by the research staff.Query Rules===========Query Rules define criteria to be used to scan the dataset for data problems. In a query rule you can define the following:* CRF model* Related requisition panel name (if applicable)* CRF questions* Timepoints (visits)* Timing (when to run the query, e.g. 48 hours after the visit report is submitted)* Priority* Research staff contact* Data manager contactAs mentioned above, a ``Data Query`` can be automatically created by a ``Query Rule``. Simple ``Query Rules`` are defined using the ``Query Rule`` form.``Query Rules`` are run by a &quot;handler&quot;. The default handler is sufficient in most cases. If not, a custom handler can be written, registered with``edc_data_manager``, and selected on the ``Query Rule`` form.When are Query Rules run?+++++++++++++++++++++++++* Query rules can be run as an Admin action from the QueryRule Admin page;* A Query rule is run when a model is modified;* Query rules can be scheduled if ``django-celery`` is installed.Data Queries trigger action items+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++When a data query is created, a supporting action item is also created. As with all action items, this means an &quot;alert&quot;shows on the participant dashboard and users can be notified by email and/or SMS. See ``edc_action_item``.QueryRuleHandler -- the default rule handler++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++For each timepoint specified in the ``Query Rule``, the handler:* checks to see if the visit report has been submitted. If not, the rule is ignored.* checks if the requisition has been completed (if a requisition panel is linked to the query rule). If the requisition has not been completed, a ``Data Query`` is created immediately.* gathers each value specified in the list of CRF form questions and calls ``inspect_model``.* if ``inspect_model`` returns False, the ``Data Query`` is created or re-opened.* if ``inspect_model`` returns True, no data query is created or the existing ``Data Query`` is resolved.Custom rule handlers++++++++++++++++++++The default rule handler, ``QueryRuleHandler``, already does a lot, but it cannot satisfy all cases. The default ``inspect_model`` methoddoes most of the form specific work of ``QueryRuleHandler``. In the default implementation of ``inspect_model``, a blank field value isconsidered invalid and ``inspect_model`` returns ``False``. This may be fine if the ``Query Rule`` is just looking for just a single field valuebut not for a combination of values. When looking for a combination of field values, a blank field value may be valid. In such casesyou can override the ``inspect_model`` method and specify the correct logic for the desired data condition.For example:.. code-block:: python    # data_manager.py    from ambition_subject.constants import AWAITING_RESULTS    from edc_constants.constants import NOT_DONE, YES, NO    from edc_data_manager.handlers import QueryRuleHandler    from edc_data_manager.site_data_manager import site_data_manager    class LumbarPunctureHandlerQ13(QueryRuleHandler):        name = &quot;lumbar_puncture_q13&quot;        display_name = &quot;Lumbar Puncture (Q13, 15, 21, 23, 24)&quot;        model_name = &quot;ambition_subject.lumbarpuncturecsf&quot;        @property        def inspect_model(self):            &quot;&quot;&quot;Lumbar Puncture/Cerebrospinal Fluid 13, 15, 21, 23, 24.            &quot;&quot;&quot;            valid = False            if self.get_field_value(&quot;csf_culture&quot;) == AWAITING_RESULTS:                pass            elif self.get_field_value(&quot;csf_culture&quot;) == NOT_DONE:                valid = True            elif self.get_field_value(&quot;csf_culture&quot;) == YES:                if (self.get_field_value(&quot;other_csf_culture&quot;)                        and self.get_field_value(&quot;csf_wbc_cell_count&quot;)                        and self.get_field_value(&quot;csf_glucose&quot;)                        and self.get_field_value(&quot;csf_protein&quot;)                        and (self.get_field_value(&quot;csf_cr_ag&quot;)                             or self.get_field_value(&quot;india_ink&quot;))):                    valid = True            elif self.get_field_value(&quot;csf_culture&quot;) == NO:                if (self.get_field_value(&quot;csf_wbc_cell_count&quot;)                        and self.get_field_value(&quot;csf_glucose&quot;)                        and self.get_field_value(&quot;csf_protein&quot;)                        and (self.get_field_value(&quot;csf_cr_ag&quot;)                             or self.get_field_value(&quot;india_ink&quot;))):                    valid = True            return valid    site_data_manager.register(LumbarPunctureHandlerQ13)Note the use of ``get_field_value`` method instead of directly accessing the model instance. This is not absolutely necessary butavoids confusion by ensuring you only access fields defined in the ``Query Rule``.Registering custom rule handlers++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++``edc_data_manager`` has a site registry that ``autodiscovers`` module ``data_manager.py`` in the root of each app in ``INSTALLED_APPS``.For example:.. code-block:: python    # data_manager.py    from edc_data_manager.handlers import QueryRuleHandler    from edc_data_manager.site_data_manager import site_data_manager    class MyCustomHandler(QueryRuleHandler):        name = &quot;my_custom_handler&quot;        display_name = &quot;My Custom Handler&quot;        model_name = &quot;my_app.somecrf&quot;        @property        def inspect_model(self):            valid = False            if self.get_field_value(&quot;field_one&quot;) == 1:            ... some more code that eventually sets valid to True            return valid    site_data_manager.register(MyCustomHandler)Dumping and loading a QueryRule fixture++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.. code-block:: bash    python manage.py dumpdata edc_data_manager.queryrule --natural-foreign --natural-primary --indent 4 -o queryrule.json.. code-block:: bash    python manage.py loaddata queryrules.jsonUpdating query rules++++++++++++++++++++Query rules can be triggered manually to run from the admin action under the `QueryRule` admin page.If ``celery`` is enabled, the ``update_query_rules`` will try to send proccessing to the MQ.See also ``update_query_rules``, ``update_query_rules_action``... |pypi| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/edc-data-manager.svg  :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/edc-data-manager.. |actions| image:: https://github.com/clinicedc/edc-data-manager/workflows/build/badge.svg?branch=develop  :target: https://github.com/clinicedc/edc-data-manager/actions?query=workflow:build.. |codecov| image:: https://codecov.io/gh/clinicedc/edc-data-manager/branch/develop/graph/badge.svg  :target: https://codecov.io/gh/clinicedc/edc-data-manager.. |downloads| image:: https://pepy.tech/badge/edc-data-manager   :target: https://pepy.tech/project/edc-data-manager</longdescription>

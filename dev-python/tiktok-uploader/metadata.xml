[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is recommended.## MacOS, Windows and LinuxInstall Python 3 or greater from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)### Downloading from PyPI (Recommended)Install `tiktok-uploader` using `pip````bashpip install tiktok-uploader```## Building from sourceInstalling from source allows greater flexability to modify the module's code to extend default behavior. First, `clone` and move into the repository. Next, install `hatch`, the build tool used for this project.[^1] Then, `build` the projet. Finally, `install` the project with the `-e` or editable flag.  ```bashgit clone https://github.com/wkaisertexas/tiktok-uploader.gitcd tiktok-uploaderpip install hatchhatch buildpip install -e . ```# Usage`tiktok-uploader` works by duplicating your browser's **cookies** which tricks **TikTok** into believing you are logged in on a remote-controlled browser.## 💻 Commmand Line Interface (CLI)Using the CLI is as simple as calling `tiktok-uploader` with your videos: `path` (-v), `description`(-d) and `cookies` (-c)```bashtiktok-uploader -v video.mp4 -d &quot;this is my escaped \&quot;description\&quot;&quot; -c cookies.txt``````pythonfrom tiktok_uploader.upload import upload_video, upload_videosfrom tiktok_uploaader.auth import AuthBackend# single videoupload_video('video.mp4',             description='this is my description',             cookies='cookies.txt')# Multiple Videosvideos = [    {        'path': 'video.mp4',         'description': 'this is my description'    },    {        'path': 'video2.mp4',         'description': 'this is also my description'    }]auth = AuthBackend(cookies='cookies.txt')upload_videos(videos=videos, auth=auth)```## ⬆️ Uploading VideosThis library revolves around the `upload_videos` function which takes in a list of videos which have **filenames** and **descriptions** and are passed as follows:```pythonfrom tiktok_uploader.upload import upload_videosfrom tiktok_uploader.auth import AuthBackendvideos = [    {        'video': 'video0.mp4',        'description': 'Video 1 is about ...'    },    {        'video': 'video1.mp4',        'description': 'Video 2 is about ...'    }]auth = AuthBackend(cookies='cookies.txt')failed_videos = upload_videos(videos=videos, auth=auth)for video in failed_videos: # each input video object which failed    print(f'{video['video']} with description &quot;{video['description']}&quot; failed')```## 🫵 Mentions and HashtagsMentions and Hashtags now work so long as they are followed by a space. However, you as the user are responsible for verifying a mention or hashtag exists before posting**Example:**```pythonfrom tiktok_uploader.upload import upload_videoupload_video('video.mp4', '#fyp @icespicee', 'cookies.txt')```## 🪡 Stitches, Duets and CommentsTo set whether or not a video uploaded allows stitches, comments or duet, simply specifiy `comment`, `stitch` and/or `duet` as keyword arguments to `upload_video` or `upload_videos`.```pythonupload_video(..., comment=True, stitch=True, duet=True)```&gt; Comments, Stiches and Duets are allowed by **default**## 🔐 AuthenticationAuthentication uses your browser's cookies. This workaround was done due to TikTok's stricter stance on authetication by a Selenium-controlled browser.Your `sessionid` is all that is required for authentication and can be passed as an argument to nearly any function[🍪 Get cookies.txt](https://github.com/kairi003/Get-cookies.txt-LOCALLY) makes getting cookies in a [NetScape cookies format](http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/Netscape_cookies.txt).After installing, open the extensions menu on [TikTok.com](https://tiktok.com/) and click `🍪 Get cookies.txt` to reveal your cookies. Select `Export As ⇩` and specify a location and name to save.**Optionally**, `cookies_list` is a list of dictionaries with keys `name`, `value`, `domain`, `path` and `expiry` which allow you to pass your own browser cookies. **Example:**```pythoncookies_list = [    {        'name': 'sessionid',        'value': '**your session id**',        'domain': 'https://tiktok.com',        'path': '/',        'expiry': '10/8/2023, 12:18:58 PM'    }]upload_video(..., cookies_list=cookies_list)```## 👀 Browser Selection[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) is the prefered browser for **TikTokUploader**. The default anti-detection techniques used in this packaged are optimized for this. However, if you wish to use a different browser you may specify the `browser` in `upload_video` or `upload_videos`.```pythonfrom tiktok_uploader.upload import upload_videofrom random import choiceBROWSERS = [    'chrome',    'safari',    'chromium',    'edge',    'firefox']# randomly picks a web browser upload_video(..., browser=choice(BROWSERS))```✅ Supported Browsers:- **Chrome** (Recommended)- **Safari**- **Chromium**- **Edge**- **FireFox** ## 🚲 Custom WebDriver Driver OptionsDefault modifications to Selenium are applied which help it avoid being detected by TikTok. However, you **may** pass a custom driver configuration options. Simply pass `options` as a keyword argument to either `upload_video` or `upload_videos`. ```pythonfrom selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Optionsoptions = Options()options.add_argument('start-maximized')upload_videos(..., options=options)```&gt; Note: Make sure to use the right selenium options for your browser## 🤯 Headless BrowsersHeadless browsing only works on Chrome. When using Chrome, adding the `--headless` flag using the CLI or passing `headless` as a keyword argument to `upload_video` or `upload_videos` is all that is required.```pythonupload_video(..., headless=True)upload_videos(..., headless=True)```## 🔨 Initial Setup[WebDriverManager](https://bonigarcia.dev/webdrivermanager/) is used to manage driver versions. On intial startup, you **may** be prompted to install the correct driver for your selected broswer. However, for **Chrome** and **Edge** the driver is automatically installed.# ♻️ Examples- **[Basic Upload Example](exmples/basic_upload.py):** Uses `upload_video` to make one post.- **[Series Upload Example](examples/series_upload.py):** Uploads the same video multiple times using `upload_videos`.- **[Scheduled Uploader Example](examples/example_series_upload.py):** Videos are read from a CSV file using [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org). A video upload attempt is made and **if and only if** it is successful will the video be marked as uploaded.# 📝 NotesThis bot is not fool proof. Though I have not gotten an official ban, the video will fail to upload after too many uploads. In testing, waiting several hours was sufficient to fix this problem. For this reason, please thing of this more as a scheduled uploader for TikTok videos, rather than a spam bot.# Accounts made with- [@C_Span](https://www.tiktok.com/@c_span?lang=en) - A split-screen channel with mobile games below featuring clips from C-Span's YouTube channel- [@habit_track](https://www.tiktok.com/@habit_track?lang=en) - A Reddit bot to see which SubReddit is most viral on TikTok[^1]: If interested in Hatch, checkout the [website](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/build/)</longdescription>

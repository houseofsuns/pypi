	<longdescription># tg-wrapThis app simply wraps terragrunt (which is a wrapper around terraform, which is a wrapper around cloud APIs, which is...).Wait, why on earth do we need a wrapper for a wrapper (for a wrapper)?Well, first of all it is pretty opinionated so what works for us, doesn't necessarily work for you.But our reasoning for creating this is as follows:## 1. Less typingterraform is great, and in combination with terragrunt even greater! But let's face it, terragrunt does not excel in conciseness! The options are pretty long, which leads to lots of typing. We don't like typing!## 2. Testing modules locallyHowever, more importantly, we are heavily utilising [TERRAGRUNT_SOURCE](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/execute-terraform-commands-on-multiple-modules-at-once/#testing-multiple-modules-locally) when developing.The thing is that as long as you use `run-all` you can use one setting for that variable (and conveniently set it as an environment variable), while if you run a regular command, you need to specify the full path. Which is obviously different for each project.Which leads to (even) more typing, and worse: a higher chance for errors.Luckily you can use `run-all` and add the appriopriate flags to ensure it behaves like a regular plan|apply|destroy etc. But again, more typing.Nothing a [bunch a aliases](https://gitlab.com/lunadata/terragrunt-utils/-/blob/main/tg-shell.sh) can't solve though!## 3. But the original reason was: Errors when using run-all are challengingOne of the main boons of terragrunt is the ability to break up large projects in smaller steps while still retaining the inter-dependencies. However, when working on such a large project and something goes wrong somewhere in the middle is pretty challenging.terragrunt's error messages are pretty massive, and this is extrapolated with every individual project in your dependency chain.And if it fails somewhere at the front, it keeps on trying until the last one, blowing up your terminal in the process.So we wanted a possibility to run the projects step by step, using the dependency graph of terragrunt and have a bit more control over it.And this was not something a bunch of aliases could solve, hence this wrapper was born. And while we we're at it, replacing the aliases with this was then pretty straightforward next step as well.## 4. Analyzing plan filesWhen using the run-all, analyzing what is about to be changed is not going to be easier. Hence we created the `tgwrap analyze` function that lists all the planned changes and (if a config file is availabe) calculates a drift score and runs a [terrasafe](https://pypi.org/project/terrasafe/) style validation check.It needs a config file as follows:```yaml---## Critically of resources as interpreted by 'tgwrap analyze'.# It uses it for a 'terrasafe' like validation if resources can safely be deleted.# On top of that it tries to analyze and quantify the drift impact of the changes,# so that this can be monitored.#low:  # defaults:  #   terrasafe_level: ignore_deletions  #   drift_impact:  #     default: minor  #     delete: medium  azuread_application.: {} # if we you want to use the defaults  azuread_app_role_assignment: # or if you want to override these    drift_impact:      delete: minor  # and so on, and so forthmedium:  # defaults:  #   terrasafe_level: ignore_deletion_if_recreation  #   drift_impact:  #     default: medium  #     delete: major  azurerm_data_factory_linked_service_key_vault.: {}  # and so on, and so forthhigh:  # defaults:  #   terrasafe_level: unauthorized_deletion  #   drift_impact:  #     default: major  #     update: medium  azuread_group.:    drift_impact:      create: minor      update: minor  azurerm_application_insights.: {}  # and so on, and so forth```### Speeding up the performance of analyzeThis `analyze` function turned out to be pretty slow, where most of the time went into the `terragrunt show` function that is executed for each individual module. This was a bit surprising as the plan file is already available on the file system, but it turns out that terragrunt is taking quite a bit of time for managing the depdencies. Even when you're excluding the external dependencies and are located in a particular module.So, if you add the following to your root `terragrunt.hcl`:```hclterraform {  after_hook &quot;link_to_current_module&quot; {    commands = [&quot;init&quot;, &quot;plan&quot;, &quot;apply&quot;, &quot;validate&quot;, &quot;destroy&quot;]    execute  = [&quot;bash&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;, &quot;ln -sf $(pwd) ${get_terragrunt_dir()}/.terragrunt-cache/current&quot;]  }}```The directory where the plan file is stored (including the other resources that terraform needs) becomes predictable and it becomes possible to run a native `terraform show` (instead `terragrunt show`) which dramatically speed up things.Just set the proper value as an environment variable:```consoleexport TGWRAP_PLANFILE_DIR=&quot;.terragrunt-cache/current&quot;```Or pass it along with the `--planfile-dir|-P` option and it will use that.## Usage```console# general helptgwrap --helptgwrap run -htgwrap run-all -h# run a plantgwrap plan # which is the same as tgwrap run plan# run-all a plantgwrap run-all plan# or do the same in step-by-step modetgwrap run-all plan -s# or excluding (aka ignoring) external dependenciestgwrap run-all plan -sx# if you want to add additional arguments it is recommended to use -- as separator (although it *might* work without)tgwrap output -- -json```&gt; Note: special precautions are needed when passing on parameters that contain quotes. For instance, if you want to move state like below, escape the double quote in the staate address:`tgwrap state mv 'azuread_group.this[\&quot;viewers\&quot;]' 'azuread_group.this[\&quot;readers\&quot;]'`## A word about escaping inputsYour shell is escaping special characters such as `*` and `&quot;` before passing it to the program (`tgwrap` in this case). So some inputs **need** to be escaped in order to function properly.For example:```console# to exclude certain modules from an action (such as analyze):tgwrap analyze -E 'integrations/\*/\*'# to import a resource that has a &quot; in its address:tgwrap import -a 'azuread_group.this[\&quot;my_group\&quot;]' -i ${GROUP_ID}```## Deploy manifestsIn order to easily deploy a new version of the terraform (and associated terragrunt) modules, we include a manifest file in the root of the landing zone:```yaml---git_repository: ssh://git@gitlab.com/my-org/my-terraform-modules-repo.gitbase_path: terragrunt/my-platformdeploy: # which modules do you want to deploy  dtap:    applies_to_stages:      - dev      - tst      - acc      - prd    source_stage: dev    base_dir: platform # optional, if you want to deploy the base modules in its own dir, side by side with substacks    exclude_modules: # these modules will always be excluded, can be omitted      - my-specific-module    include_modules: {} # omit or use an empty dict for all of them      # or specify your modules as follows      # base: {} # just a simple include      # networking-connected: # or a bit more complicated      #  - source: networking      #  - target: networking-connectedsub_stacks:  is01:    source: shared-integration/intsvc01    target: integration/is01    exclude_modules:  # a list of modules that will always be excluded, can be omitted      - my-specific-module  is02:    source: shared-integration/intsvc01    target: integration/is02# global configuration files that are deployed as well# note that these files are typically applicable to all landing zones and stages!# this might lead to unexpected behaviour# note that you can exclude syncing these files with a command line switchglobal_config_files:  root-terragrunt:    source: ../../terragrunt.hcl # relative to base_path    target: ../../terragrunt.hcl # can be omitted, then it is same as source path  terrasafe-config:    source: ../../terrasafe-config.json```## DevelopmentIn order to develop, you need to apply it to your terragrunt projects. For that you can use the `--terragrunt-working-dir` option and just run it from the poetry directory. Alternatively you can use the [tgwrap-dev](./tgwrap-dev) script and invoke that from your terragrunt directories. Either put it in your `PATH` or create an alias for convenience.</longdescription>

	<longdescription>Tango Shared Core=====Provides shared and core functionality used by multiple Tango apps,and will be installed by them as needed.[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tBaxter/tango-shared-core.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tBaxter/tango-shared-core)## So what's in here, anyway?### Base modelsAbstract base models are included for common content objects, including images, so you can handle common fields and needs quickly, easily and consistently.### Useful settingsA lot of them. Seriously, take a look at the settings file.### Template tags and filters* Formatting helpers* Simple (and non-tracking) social media links.* Additional time output helpers### A robust base templateBased on HTML5 Boilerplate, but for Django, and battle-tested.### A administrator how-to section in the adminYou already have developer documentation in the admin. This gives you hooks to include documentation aimed at administrators as well, just by including a `how_to.md` file in your app. See the other Tango apps for examples.### Middleware and Context Processors* StripEmptyLines: Strips HTML output of excessive newlines* CompactHTMLMiddleware: Pseudo-minification for HTML output, good for a 30-40% reduction in file size. Not entirely safe with `pre` tags. Use with caution.* The site_processor context processor adds a bunch of useful things in context.### Utils* Robust user submission sanitization* Map tools to ease Google Map integration (Note: You'll need to set `GMAP_KEY` in your settings)### JS* A solid implementation of Markitup## InstallationInstallation should be automatic, from the application needing it.You can also install from pip or github.If you run into appRegistry issues, be sure  `INSTALLED_APPS` contains`easy_thumbnails` and  `django.contrib.contenttypes`.</longdescription>

	<longdescription>What is lifelib?----------------`lifelib` is a collection of algorithms for simulating and manipulatingpatterns in cellular automata. It can be included in your project ineither of two ways: - **Python package**: `lifelib` can be imported as a Python package,   and is compatible with both Python 2.7 and Python 3.5 (and beyond).   We recommend this for everyday use, as the Python bindings are more   high-level and user-friendly. - **C++ header files**: if you have a project written in C++11 or above,   specific components of `lifelib` may be included. This approach is   used by the [apgsearch](https://gitlab.com/apgoucher/apgmera) soup   searcher and the [slmake](https://gitlab.com/apgoucher/slmake) glider   synthesis compiler. Note that `lifelib` is header-only owing to the   use of templates.System requirements-------------------For `lifelib` to work, you need a computer with an **x86-64 processor**.This includes most personal computers, but not smartphones, tablets, or theRaspberry Pi.It runs easily in a POSIX environment, such as: - Linux / Unix; - Mac OS X; - Windows (using Cygwin); - Windows 10 (using WSL);and requires a C++ compiler (gcc or clang) and Python (ideally with numpy).The Python version of `lifelib` can actually run in Windows' native Python(e.g. Anaconda). A suitable Cygwin installation still needs to exist on themachine and be locatable by `lifelib`; the Python package contains a function(`lifelib.install_cygwin()`) to automatically and painlessly handle this.Documentation------------- - [Quick start][1] - [Installation notes][2] - [The structure of lifelib][3] - [Example usage for Python][4] - [Editing patterns][5] - [Analysing and viewing patterns][6][1]: https://gitlab.com/apgoucher/lifelib/blob/master/doc/quickstart.md[2]: https://gitlab.com/apgoucher/lifelib/blob/master/doc/install.md[3]: https://gitlab.com/apgoucher/lifelib/blob/master/doc/structure.md[4]: https://gitlab.com/apgoucher/lifelib/blob/master/doc/exampleusage.md[5]: https://gitlab.com/apgoucher/lifelib/blob/master/doc/editing.md[6]: https://gitlab.com/apgoucher/lifelib/blob/master/doc/analysis.mdFuture directions----------------- - Currently lifelib is specific to 64-bit x86 architecture; ideally   support for other architectures will be introduced. - An experimental _logic synthesis_ branch is under development. That   will allow custom rules (expressed as rule tables or trees) to be   automatically compiled into Boolean circuits. - In addition to the existing C++11 and Python bindings, the author   is aiming to add Wolfram Language bindings for the library.</longdescription>

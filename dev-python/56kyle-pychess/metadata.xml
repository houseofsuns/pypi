Martin. Most of the code in this library is written with the principles of clean code in mind.### General Design Decisions- The Board class is immutable. This means that every time a move is made, a new board is created. This is to prevent the board from being in an invalid state.- Moves and most geometry related classes are described in terms of Points and Lines- Almost all iterables are sets to allow for hash comparisons of various frozen dataclass based objects### Simplifications- The board may not be infinite- The board must be a rectangle## Features- [ ] API    - [ ] Game    - [x] Board    - [ ] Move    - [x] Piece    - [x] Player    - [x] Square- [ ] Engine- [ ] UCI- [ ] GUI- [ ] Documentation## Usage### Game    TODO### Board    TODO### Move    TODO### Piece    TODO### Player    TODO### Square    TODO        </longdescription>

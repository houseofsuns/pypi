	<longdescription>This package aims to give and easy pluggable module to provide authentication and user maintennance in a Pyramid web application.It relies the Pyramid+SQLAlchemy+Mako stack. Implementation for other template languages is on the roadmap.# Installation and setup## Install the packageInstall the package with:```sh  pip install ppss_auth```or put ppss_auth in your app dependencies (setup.py, in the install_requires list of packages)To activate the package, in your main *\_\_init\_\_.py* file, inside the main function, add this line: ```python  config.include('ppss_auth')```in your models include the ppss_auth's models with this line:```pythonfrom ppss_auth.models import *```## Configure the databaseThis can be a zero-db-conf module:run the app with _ppss_auth.initdb_ set to True (that is the default for the params, so you can even leave it blank: see configuration, below). You are done with this, unless you need more in-depth initialization (follow reading)### You want to do it yourselfTo init the Tables manually, in the initialization script (usually in *scripts/intializedb.py*), add this row:```python  from ppss_auth import (models as ppssmodels)```and while creating the default data (in the &quot;with transaction.manager&quot; block of code), use something like:```python  ppssmodels.initdb(dbsession,createdefault=False)```This creates the tables and, if *createdefault* evaulates to True, it create a default admin/admin user with the admin permission. Please change the password to avoid secuirity issues.You can create some data as well. Refer to [models] section, below, for more info.## RequirementsWhen a user login, *essionauthpolicy* is used to store her informations (userid and user groups). ## ini file configuration ppss_auth use these info from the ini file:*default user*- ppss_auth.adminname - the name of a sueruser. Deafult to &quot;admin&quot;- ppss_auth.adminpass - the corresponding password. If not provided the admin is not allowed to log in (with the ini credentials. It may exist in database)*predefined permissions, groups, users*- ppss_auth.permission_list - list of permission, one on each indented row- ppss_auth.group_list- ppss_auth.user_list- ppss_auth.default_passwordAn example is as follow: ```python  ppss_auth.permission_list =    permision1    permision2    permision3  ppss_auth.group_list =    group1=permision1,permision2    group2=permision1    group3=permision2  ppss_auth.user_list=    user1=group1,group2    iser2=group3  ppss_auth.default_password = temp0r4ryPassword-&gt;changeme!```*db stuff*- ppss_auth.initdb [True] - true/false value, tells the lib to init db automatically on first run.*routes*- ppss_auth.login_url [/login] - url for login.- ppss_auth.logout_url [/logout]- url for logout.*where to land after succesfull login/logout*- ppss_auth.post_login_follow - try to redirect the browser back to where it came from after successful login (use true case insensitive to activate it). It's useful if combined with the forbidden pattern- ppss_auth.post_login_route [home] - name of the route where to send the browser after user logged in. Ignored if ppss_auth.post_login_follow is set to true AND there is a referer to go to.- ppss_auth.post_logout_route - name of the route where to send the browser after log out. Defaults to home*templates stuff*You can override all this values and even provide a mako-free environment. This can be a litlle tricky, but there is no hard-coded dependency to mako, just the defaults.- ppss_auth.logintemplate - name of the login template. It defaults to the internal template: &quot;ppss_auth:/templates/login.mako&quot;- ppss_auth.changepasswordtemplate - name of the change password template. Defaults to: ppss_auth:/templates/change.mako- ppss_auth.modifyusertemplate - Defaults to: ppss_auth:/templates/modifyuser.mako- ppss_auth.listusertemplate - Defaults to: ppss_auth:/templates/listuser.mako- ppss_auth.logintemplateinherit - Defaults to: ppss_auth:/templates/layout.mako*look and feel*- ppss_auth.bootstrapversion - Should 3 or 4, accordind to the the version of bootstrap that the hosting site uses. Defaults to 4# Things to know (devs only)## databaseThi package provide the creation and usage of 3 main tables (and the other tables required for ER consistency):- ppss_user - containing basic information about the users (username, hashed password and related data )- ppss_group - user groups to allow for easier handling of user groups and permissions- ppss_permission - a list of permissions (just an id and a name)## models### PPSsuserThis represents the user of your application.She has a _username_, a _password_ and relation to her _groups_. She also has a _enabled_ property and some timestamps (creation times, and similar times).Use the _setPassword(password)_ method on PPSsuser instances to change the password, providing the new password._todict(self)_ is a commodity method to get a dict of the main properties.### PPSsgroupThis class represnts the groups of your users. It's a many-to-many relation: each user can belong to many groups, and each group can gather many users.Other than a _name_ and the _enabled_ flag (integer with 1 for enabled), its main user is the many-to-many relation to permissions. This means that all users in the same group share (at least) all the permissions given to the group.### PPSspermissionThis class represents the permissions of the application. You can create new permissions and link them to group. You can use those permissions in the _permission_ attribute of the _view\_config_ decorator to restrict usage of some methods using ACL, or you can check it whenever needed.# Integrating with existing alembic- enp.py fileadd the following row among the imports:```pythonfrom ppss_auth.ppss_auth_utils.db import exclude_ppss_auth_tables```and use it *run_migrations_offline* function substituting context with:```pythoncontext.configure(url=settings['sqlalchemy.url'],**exclude_ppss_auth_tables(config))```and in *run_migrations_online* substituting context with:```pythoncontext.configure(  connection=connection,  target_metadata=target_metadata,**exclude_ppss_auth_tables(config))```add the following to your .ini file, below *alembic* section:```ini[alembic:exclude]tables = module_db_versionpattern = ppss*  *auth*```This package aims to give and easy pluggable module to provide authentication and user maintennance in a Pyramid web application.It relies the Pyramid+SQLAlchemy+Mako stack.

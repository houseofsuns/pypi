	<longdescription># Next-generation NDS oscilloscope`ndscope` is a tool for viewing time series data from the LIGO NetworkData Services (NDS).  Based on[nds2-client](https://git.ligo.org/nds/nds2-client) and thehigh-performance [pyqtgraph](http://pyqtgraph.org/) plotting library,`ndscope` is a able to plot both online and offline data for manychannels simultaneously with intuitive mouse pan/zoom support.![ndscope](ndscope.png)### Features:* online mode for raw and trend data* mouse pan and zoom, with background auto-fetch of new data* automatic transition to second/minute trend data at appropriate zoom levels* triggering, for true oscilloscope behavior* cursors and crosshair in both time and Y axes* save layout templates in easy-to-use YAML format* load templates from various legacy formats, including StripTool .stp, dataviewer .xml, and .txt* enhanced &quot;StripTool mode&quot; with auto-backfill of past data* NDS2 and NDS1 protocol support* channel selection GUILeft mouse click+drag for pan, and right mouse click+drag for zoom(left/right for in/out in time, and up/down for in/out in Y).Click+drag on axis to retrict pan/zoom to only that dimension.## IssuesPlease report issues to the [gitlab issue tracker](https://git.ligo.org/cds/ndscope/issues).## RequirementsPackage requirements for `ndscope` (Debian package names):* [python3-pyqtgraph](http://pyqtgraph.org/)* [python3-nds2-client](https://git.ligo.org/nds/nds2-client)* python3-qtpy* [python3-gpstime](https://git.ligo.org/cds/gpstime)* python3-dateutil* python3-yaml* python3-cairosvg* python3-h5pyThe following packages are used for development purposes:* pyqt5-dev-tools* qt5-designer* python3-setuptools_scm* pytest3-pytestPre-built binary packages are available via[pip](https://pypi.org/projects/ndscope) and[conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ndscope) and for the various[IGWN supported operatingsystems](https://computing.docs.ligo.org/guide/software/installation/).</longdescription>

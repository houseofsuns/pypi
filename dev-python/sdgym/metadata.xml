Measure performance and memory usage across different synthetic data modelingtechniques – classical statistics, deep learning and more!&lt;img align=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;docs/images/SDGym_Results.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;The SDGym library integrates with the Synthetic Data Vault ecosystem. You can use any of itssynthesizers, datasets or metrics for benchmarking. You also customize the process to includeyour own work.* **Datasets**: Select any of the publicly available datasets from the SDV project, or input your own data.* **Synthesizers**: Choose from any of the SDV synthesizers and baselines. Or write your own custommachine learning model.* **Evaluation**: In addition to performance and memory usage, you can also measure synthetic dataquality and privacy through a variety of metrics# InstallInstall SDGym using pip or conda. We recommend using a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other software on your device.```bashpip install sdgym``````bashconda install -c conda-forge sdgym```For more information about using SDGym, visit the [SDGym Documentation](https://docs.sdv.dev/sdgym).# UsageLet's benchmark synthetic data generation for single tables. First, let's define which modelingtechniques we want to use. Let's choose a few synthesizers from the SDV library and a few othersto use as baselines.```python# these synthesizers come from the SDV library# each one uses different modeling techniquessdv_synthesizers = ['GaussianCopulaSynthesizer', 'CTGANSynthesizer']# these basic synthesizers are available in SDGym# as baselinesbaseline_synthesizers = ['UniformSynthesizer']```Now, we can benchmark the different techniques:```pythonimport sdgymsdgym.benchmark_single_table(    synthesizers=(sdv_synthesizers + baseline_synthesizers))```The result is a detailed performance, memory and quality evaluation across the synthesizerson a variety of publicly available datasets.## Supplying a custom synthesizerBenchmark your own synthetic data generation techniques. Define your synthesizer byspecifying the training logic (using machine learning) and the sampling logic.```pythondef my_training_logic(data, metadata):    # create an object to represent your synthesizer    # train it using the data    return synthesizerdef my_sampling_logic(trained_synthesizer, num_rows):    # use the trained synthesizer to create    # num_rows of synthetic data    return synthetic_data```Learn more in the [Custom Synthesizers Guide](https://docs.sdv.dev/sdgym/customization/synthesizers/custom-synthesizers).## Customizing your datasetsThe SDGym library includes many publicly available datasets that you can include right away.List these using the ``get_available_datasets`` feature.```pythonsdgym.get_available_datasets()``````dataset_name   size_MB     num_tablesKRK_v1         0.072128    1adult          3.907448    1alarm          4.520128    1asia           1.280128    1...```You can also include any custom, private datasets that are stored on your computer on anAmazon S3 bucket.```my_datasets_folder = 's3://my-datasets-bucket'```For more information, see the docs for [Customized Datasets](https://docs.sdv.dev/sdgym/customization/datasets).# What's next?Visit the [SDGym Documentation](https://docs.sdv.dev/sdgym) to learn more!---&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://datacebo.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;center&quot; width=40% src=&quot;https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/blob/master/docs/images/DataCebo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[The Synthetic Data Vault Project](https://sdv.dev) was first created at MIT's [Data to AI Lab](https://dai.lids.mit.edu/) in 2016. After 4 years of research and traction with enterprise, wecreated [DataCebo](https://datacebo.com) in 2020 with the goal of growing the project.Today, DataCebo is the proud developer of SDV, the largest ecosystem forsynthetic data generation &amp; evaluation. It is home to multiple libraries that support syntheticdata, including:* 🔄 Data discovery &amp; transformation. Reverse the transforms to reproduce realistic data.* 🧠 Multiple machine learning models -- ranging from Copulas to Deep Learning -- to create tabular,  multi table and time series data.* 📊 Measuring quality and privacy of synthetic data, and comparing different synthetic data  generation models.[Get started using the SDV package](https://sdv.dev/SDV/getting_started/install.html) -- a fullyintegrated solution and your one-stop shop for synthetic data. Or, use the standalone librariesfor specific needs.# History## v0.6.0 - 2021-02-01This release introduces methods for benchmarking single table data and creating custom synthesizers, which can be based on existing SDGym-defined synthesizers or on user-defined functions.

	<longdescription>python-av====[![GitHub Test Status][github-tests-badge]][github-tests] \[![Gitter Chat][gitter-badge]][gitter] [![Documentation][docs-badge]][docs] \[![Python Package Index][pypi-badge]][pypi] [![Conda Forge][conda-badge]][conda]**python-av is a FORK of PyAV.****conda-forge package currently not available**python-av is a Pythonic binding for the [FFmpeg][ffmpeg] libraries. We aim to provide all of the power and control of the underlying library, but manage the gritty details as much as possible.python-av is for direct and precise access to your media via containers, streams, packets, codecs, and frames. It exposes a few transformations of that data, and helps you get your data to/from other packages (e.g. Numpy and Pillow).This power does come with some responsibility as working with media is horrendously complicated and python-av can't abstract it away or make all the best decisions for you. If the `ffmpeg` command does the job without you bending over backwards, python-av is likely going to be more of a hindrance than a help.But where you can't work without it, python-av is a critical tool.Installation------------Due to the complexity of the dependencies, python-av is not always the easiest Python package to install from source. Since release 8.0.0 binary wheels are provided on [PyPI][pypi] for Linux, Mac and Windows linked against a modern FFmpeg. You can install these wheels by running:```bashpip install python-av```If you want to use your existing FFmpeg, the source version of python-av is on [PyPI][pypi] too:```bashpip install python-av --no-binary av```Alternative installation methods--------------------------------Another way of installing python-av is via [conda-forge][conda-forge]:```bashconda install python-av -c conda-forge```See the [Conda install][conda-install] docs to get started with (mini)Conda.And if you want to build from the absolute source (for development or testing):```bashgit clone git@github.com:dot-six/python-avcd python-avsource scripts/activate.sh &lt;FFMPEG-VERSION&gt;# Either install the testing dependencies:pip install --upgrade -r tests/requirements.txt# or have it all, including FFmpeg, built/installed for you:# For developers, this is recommended:./scripts/build-deps# If you have problem doing build-deps, read this wiki:# http://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/Ubuntu# NOTE: disable all non-server libraries, it is not needed.# Build python-av.make```---Have fun, [read the docs][docs], [come chat with us][gitter], and good luck![conda-badge]: https://img.shields.io/conda/vn/conda-forge/av.svg?colorB=CCB39A[conda]: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/python-av[docs-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-on%20pyav.org-blue.svg[docs]: http://pyav.org/docs[gitter-badge]: https://img.shields.io/gitter/room/nwjs/nw.js.svg?logo=gitter&amp;colorB=cc2b5e[gitter]: https://gitter.im/PyAV-Org[pypi-badge]: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/python-av.svg?colorB=CCB39A[pypi]: https://pypi.org/project/python-av[github-tests-badge]: https://github.com/dot-six/python-av/workflows/tests/badge.svg[github-tests]: https://github.com/dot-six/python-av/actions?workflow=tests[github]: https://github.com/dot-six/python-av[ffmpeg]: http://ffmpeg.org/[conda-forge]: https://conda-forge.github.io/[conda-install]: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html</longdescription>

	<longdescription># vaknl-userDefines the vaknl `User` dataclass. A user (here identified by a `dmp_user_id`) is an object that is defined by website clickstream data as a basis. The User class contains functions that can transform raw Firestore website clickstream data to well defined `Event` dataclasses and update the statistics of the `User` accordingly. These Event dataclasses are read and translated into user information. The `User` dataclass also includes methods to read from and write to Firestore.### Authors | Date   | Name   || ------ | ------ || 2020-08-06 | Merijn van Es | ## PrerequisitesFirestore read and write permissions within the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), if one wants to make use of the Firestore functionality.## Project structure```vaknl-user    |__ data        |__ ...                                     # Data used for testing.    |__ tests        |__ event            |__ __init__.py                         # Empty, but required for package.            |__ test_create_event.py                # Unit testing on create_event() function.            |__ test_event.py                       # Unit testing on Event and Events dataclasses.            |__ test_search_page_search_query.py    # Unit testing on SearchPageSearchQuery (Event) dataclass.        |__ user            |__ __init__.py                         # Empty, but required for package.            |__ test_email.py                       # Unit testing on Email dataclass.            |__ test_statistics.py                  # Unit testing on Statistics dataclass.            |__ test_user.py                        # Unit testing on User dataclass.            |__ test_update_firestore_user.py       # Unit testing on update_firestore_user() function.        |__ __init__.py        |__ README.md                               # Explanation on testing.        |__ utils.py                                # Utility functions for testing.    |__ vaknl_NBC                                   # Package that creates a NBC API on local data.        |__ __init__.py                             # Includes NBC class.        |__ (NBC.pkl)                               # NBC data; should not be included in distributed versions.    |__ vaknl_user        |__ event            |__ __init__.py                         # Imports all package modules and contains create_event function.            |__ event.py                            # Contains Event and Events dataclasses.            |__ filter.py                           # Contains all filter event dataclasses.            |__ other.py                            # Contains all other event dataclasses.            |__ pageview.py                         # Contains all pageview event dataclasses.            |__ reservation.py                      # Contains all reservation event dataclasses.            |__ utils.py                            # Utility functions for testing.        |__ user            |__ __init__.py                         # Imports all package modules.            |__ email.py                            # Contains Email dataclass.            |__ statistics.py                       # Contains all statistic dataclasses and subsidiaries.            |__ user.py                             # Contains User dataclass.            |__ utils.py                            # Utility functions for testing.        |__ __init__.py                             # Empty, but required for package.    |__ LICENSE                                     # Licensing information.    |__ MANIFEST.in                                 # Adds and removes files from distribution.    |__ README.md                                   # Project explanation.    |__ setup.py                                    # Package build script.```## `User` dataclassCan be found under `vaknl_user.user.user.User` and has the following useful methods:### `update(self, client: utils.firestore.Client, nbc_api: NBC = None)`Gets all raw clickstream events that has occurred after the latest event tracked in the `statistics` andupdates the user with it.### `@classmethod` `from_firestore_clickstream(cls, client: utils.firestore.Client, dmp_user_id: str, nbc_api: NBC = None)`Creates user with all raw clickstream events available.### `@classmethod` `from_firestore_user(cls, client: utils.firestore.Client, dmp_user_id: str)`Create `User` dataclass from a Firestore user.### `to_firestore(self, client: utils.firestore.Client)`Exports user to Firestore user collection, overwriting it.## `update_firestore_user(client: utils.firestore.Client, dmp_user_id: str, nbc_api: NBC = None)`The `update_firestore_user()` function is used to update the document in the `dmp_user` Firestore collection for a user with given `dmp_user_id`.## `Event` dataclassThis dataclass has many children (can be found in the same package directory under `filer.py`, `other.py`, `pageview.py` or `reservation.py`, which represent the individual clickstream events of interest. The `Event` dataclass can be found under `vaknl_user.event.event.Event` and should, in practice, only be called through the methods of the `User` dataclass.## `Events` dataclassThis dataclass contains a list of `Event` instances, but has some useful methods that make it more desirable than a plain list. The `Events` dataclass can be found under `vaknl_user.event.event.Events` and should, in practice, only be called through the methods of the `User` dataclass.## `create_event(data: dict)`The `create_event()` function is used to transform single raw clickstream event dictionaries to a instance of `Event` (and one of it child dataclasses). The `create_event()` function can be found under `vaknl_user.event.event.Event` and should, in practice, only be called through the methods of the `User` dataclass.</longdescription>

Many devices atthe LCLS are covered by ophyd-provided classes such as ``EpicsMotor`` and``AreaDetector``, but there are also many more custom and unique devices.This repository:* Defines unique device classes required by the LCLS, referenced by happi  and our [device_config](https://github.com/pcdshub/device_config/) database.* Offers LCLS-tailored solutions for functionality not provided by ophyd* Provides essential tools to aid in the creation of new devices for specific  applications* Acts as a proving ground for features that may eventually be destined for  ophyd* ... and more!Much of the core re-used functionality can be found in``pcdsdevices.device``, ``pcdsdevices.interface``, ``pcdsdevices.pseudopos``,and ``pcdsdevices.signal``.## InstallationInstall the most recent tagged build:```bash$ conda install -c conda-forge pcdsdevices```Install the most recent development build:```bash$ conda install pcdsdevices -c pcds-dev -c lightsource2-tag -c conda-forge```Or alternatively:```bash# Install the tagged version for the dependencies$ conda install -c conda-forge pcdsdevices# Clone the master branch:$ git clone https://github.com/pcdshub/pcdsdevices$ cd pcdsdevices# And perform a development install:$ python -m pip install -e .```## Testing### Testing from psbuild-rhel7Use the pcds conda environment:```bash$ source /cds/group/pcds/pyps/conda/pcds_conda```### Testing without PCDS serversEnsure you have all of the development requirements available:```bash$ pip install -r dev-requirements.txt```### General testing steps```bash$ git clone https://github.com/pcdshub/pcdsdevices$ cd pcdsdevices# Switch to a branch that reflects what you're working on:$ git checkout -b my_feature_branch_name# Make your changes to files# Install pre-commit to allow for style checks before committing$ pre-commit install# Run the test suite$ python run_tests.py -v```If all is well, commit and push your changes.If pre-commit complains about an issue, you will need to resolve it and tryagain.```bash$ git commit -a -m &quot;ENH: my new feature&quot;$ git remote add my_remote git@github.com:my_username/pcdsdevices$ git push -u my_remote my_feature_branch_name```</longdescription>

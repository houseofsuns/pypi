	<longdescription># Safe Action Model LearningSAM learner is an algorithm to efficiently and *safely* learn action models of STRIPS problems.This repository contains two variations of the algorithm:* The classic SAM learning algorithm.* Lightweight version of ESAM learning algorithm.The code is also available as a package to download in [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/sam-learner/).## Requirements:The repository's code is currently running using [Python](https://python.org) &gt;= 3.8.In addition, This code is currently depending on the on version 1.3 of [pyperplan](https://github.com/aibasel/pyperplan).## Installation:From the Python package index (PyPI):    pip install sam-learner   ## Features:The repository offers two variants of the SAM learning algorithm, the classical SAM learning algorithm as well as a lightweight version of the *Extended* SAM learning algorithm.### Classical SAM Learning:* Learn *lifted* action model of classical PDDL problems.* Currently, supports PDDL-1.2 only.* Export learned domain via domain export functionality.### Extended SAM Learning:* Learn *lifted* action model of classical PDDL problems.* Extends SAM to also learn action models in case that there is an ambiguity in the actions' execution process.* Currently, supports PDDL-1.2 only.* Export learned domain via domain export functionality.### New Feature:Now the code outputs trajectories in a format that FAMA action model learning can read and translate.</longdescription>
